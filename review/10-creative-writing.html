  <h3><a href="../10-creative-writing/read/high-tech-high-article-carolyn.html" target="_blank">high-tech-high-article-carolyn</a></h3>
  <p class="flag-summary">Rob Riordan's detailed analysis of High Tech High (San Diego), a leading innovative charter school founded 2000 by Gary Jacobs and others. School features three key integrations: connecting school to community through 100+ hour student internships; integrating students across academic levels without tracking; linking hands and minds through project-based learning. School serves 2,000+ diverse students with exceptional college admission rates (99% of Class 2009, 80% to four-year universities including MIT, Stanford, Johns Hopkins). Teachers work in teams, spend morning time in professional collaboration. HTH achieves this within California's $7,000 per-pupil allocation. School emphasizes personalization, habits of mind, portfolio exhibitions, and community presentations.</p>
  <p class="flag-reason"><strong>Reason:</strong> A detailed article authored by Rob Riordan (July 2009) about High Tech High school in San Diego, not Don's work. The title suggests it was received from someone named Carolyn; Don appears to have saved it as reference material for his education reform advocacy.</p>

  <p class="flag-summary">(170-210 words):** This document is the constitution or bylaws of what appears to be a Prince Edward Island home schooling federation or organization. It includes navigational elements and structural references to an official website (edu.pe.ca), suggesting it's an officially recognized educational organization. The constitution establishes governance structures, membership terms, resources access, and organizational procedures for home school families in PEI. The presence of this document in Don's collection reflects interest in or awareness of alternative educational pathways and diverse learning environments within PEI's educational ecosystem. Home schooling represents a different approach to education outside traditional institutional settings, yet still contributing to the overall educational landscape. Don's interest in this material may reflect a commitment to understanding all educational options available to learners in the province and recognizing education occurs through multiple pathways.</p>
  <p class="flag-reason"><strong>Reason:</strong> Website content scraped or printed from the PEI Home and School Federation site (April 2011), including navigation elements, news items, and event listings. This is a third-party institutional publication saved as reference material, not Don's writing.</p>

  <p class="flag-summary">French newsletter (No. 63, April 18, 2018) questioning diploma-grading calendar compatibility. Don reflects on 50-year challenge of balancing individual pacing with group instruction. Proposes six options including schools exiting certification role, independent diploma-granting bodies, adjusted time-based learning standards, and Canadian Certification Council establishment. References personal optometrist visit observing patient education approach. Includes haunting poem about teacher who taught poetry to student later convicted of murder. Reflects on teaching philosophy.</p>
  <p class="flag-reason"><strong>Reason:</strong> Garbage ratio of 0.0547 marginally exceeds the 0.05 threshold, and this French-language version of Open Education No. 63 appears to be a near-duplicate of the English version in slug '8-graduation'. Human review should confirm whether both versions need to be retained.</p>

  <p class="flag-summary">This 2015-2018 document outlines diverse funding-eligible project proposals including independent information surveys, assessment services, greenfield school design competitions, learning cafes, student advisors, community education workers, educational events, non-credit technical courses, and strategic &quot;hook&quot; campaigns. Don proposes diverse revenue models including fee-for-service, workshops, educational trade shows, self-instructional materials, and for-profit development ventures. Projects emphasize independent information provision, stakeholder engagement, innovation support, and community-driven solutions. The breadth of concepts demonstrates Don's entrepreneurial thinking about educational improvement funding and his conviction that market-based and community-based models complement traditional education systems.</p>
  <p class="flag-reason"><strong>Reason:</strong> Garbage ratio of 0.0721 exceeds the 0.05 threshold, indicating possible encoding artifacts. Content is otherwise substantive (Don's Education 20/20 project brainstorming), so human review is warranted to confirm whether corruption is significant.</p>

  <h3><a href="../10-creative-writing/read/exit-outcomes-haney.html" target="_blank">exit-outcomes-haney</a></h3>
  <p class="flag-summary">This document outlines the Exit Outcomes framework for Thomas Haney Secondary School in British Columbia, defining six categories of graduate competencies: High Quality Producers (create quality products/services, manage time effectively); Collaborative Workers (express and value ideas, work in changing environments); Global Citizens (interact with diverse cultures, promote environmental health); Socially Responsible Contributors (participate politically, process information ethically); Self-Actualized Individuals (value themselves positively, set goals, solve problems); and Communicative Persons (interact using multiple communication processes). The framework emphasizes Creative Contributors who develop solutions, experiment, take risks, and drive change. This comprehensive competency model reflects modern educational standards prioritizing both academic achievement and broader life skills development essential for student success.</p>
  <p class="flag-reason"><strong>Reason:</strong> The Exit Outcomes framework for Thomas Haney Secondary School (BC) is a third-party school policy document, not Don's writing. However, Don may have adapted or cited this framework in his own education advocacy work, so borderline.</p>

  <h3><a href="../10-creative-writing/read/untitled-1.html" target="_blank">untitled-1</a></h3>
  <p class="flag-summary">A short poem titled 'Untitled' (circa 1973-74) exploring themes of problem-solving, time's passage, and the need for finding balance. The poem reflects philosophical concerns about decisions, time's fleeting nature, and learning to value life's precious moments.</p>
  <p class="flag-reason"><strong>Reason:</strong> Opening stanzas are nearly identical to slug 'untitled-9' (both begin 'Hyper / Perhaps / Problems are solved / In the Still of the night', both dated December 1973). The content preview notes 'Time is in…cannot decipher, see original,' suggesting this may be an incomplete transcription rather than a distinct poem.</p>

  <h3><a href="../10-creative-writing/read/untitled-letter-1.html" target="_blank">untitled-letter-1</a></h3>
  <p class="flag-summary">A personal letter in verse form dated December 13, 1987, apologizing for not responding sooner to a friend's letter while noting that the friend's words are being published through a prestigious university (Cambridge, implied by &quot;Located on the Cam&quot;). Don expresses both personal reflection on his changing life circumstances and a broader philosophical pondering about identity and material trappings. The tone is warm, introspective, and shows Don in his post-Holland College consulting phase.</p>
  <p class="flag-reason"><strong>Reason:</strong> Content is nearly identical to slug 'untitled-5': both are versions of the same December 13, 1987 letter-poem beginning 'Upon my desk, they sat / Opened, read and contents noted / But still unanswered.' Minor wording differences suggest one may be a draft and the other a fair copy.</p>
