Don describes his 40+ year research beginning with his Great-Grandfather John Glendinning&#x27;s family Bible (emigrated Scotland 1830). Provides earliest Glendinning information: John Glendinning born April 2, 1807 at Callister Hall, Scotland, married Margaret Harley August 23, 1833. Discusses Harley and Knowles connections, Peters lineage through his grandmother Elizabeth Peters Glendenning. Notes the striking pattern of few males in the Glendenning line producing male offspring. Shows Don&#x27;s meticulous record-keeping and deep family knowledge from the project&#x27;s inception.<div class="expanded-file"><a href="read/chronicle-001.html">Read</a> · <a href="files/01.doc">Download</a></div></div></td>

Provides earliest documented family dates and discusses how many generations removed Don is from various ancestral lines (6th generation Glendenning, 5th generation Watling/MacDonald/MacAskill/MacNaughton/Leach/Rae, etc.). Fascinating section on &quot;Wanderers&quot; describing how many Glendennings and Watlings emigrated to Portland, Maine and other US locations in the early 1900s, including Don&#x27;s parents&#x27; journey. Vividly describes Jane Watling (Don&#x27;s mother) arriving in Portland January 24, 1908—the day Portland City Hall burned.<div class="expanded-file"><a href="read/chronicle-002.html">Read</a> · <a href="files/02.doc">Download</a></div></div></td>
