	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">This
	has been a busy summer for road construction on PEI, mostly
	rebuilding, widening, intersections, paving and some bridge repair. 
	Watching the heavy equipment made me think of road construction in
	Black River before WW2.  In particular, I recall:</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

	</p>
	<ul>
		<li><p style="widows: 2; orphans: 2; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
		Gravel,
		mostly shale from one of pits (MacDougall pit in Hexham, Finno pit
		near Little Branch Bridge,   Harry’s Hill on the north side of
		the Little Branch.)  Also there was a large pit on the McKnight
		Road, a pit in Finno’s bank used when gravel was hauled on the
		ice for rebuilding the Little Branch Bridge.  In talking with
		Brother Ken, we think that there was a gravel pit at John W.
		MacNaughton’s and one above the Moncton Highway on the North Side
		of Black River but cannot recall them.</p></li>
		<li><p style="widows: 2; orphans: 2; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
		Gravel
		was loosened with a pick and shoveled by hand on to wagons and
		carts.  I know there were ramps where horses could travel up a ramp
		pulling a scoop, and empty the gravel into a dump cart or on to a
		wagon but I cannot remember one in Black River.  Drivers did not
		shovel gravel; they pulled into the pit and waited while others
		loaded their wagons.</p></li>
		<li><p style="widows: 2; orphans: 2; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
		For
		hauling gravel, truck wagons were fitted with a flat bottom made
		from small straight poles or 2x4’s.  The side of the gravel box
		was a six or eight inch plank in its edge.  The box also had both a
		front board and a tailgate.  When the wagon reached the point where
		the gravel was needed, front and rear gates were removed and planks
		and poles were lifted so that the gravel dropped to the road.  The
		box of a dump cart, as their name implies, simply tipped to allow
		the gravel to spill out. Gravel was spread by men with shovels.</p></li>
		<li><p style="widows: 2; orphans: 2; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
		In 1930, A. W. MacDougall
		was paid $1.50 a load for delivering gravel to the Black River
		Community Hall; it appears that a person could deliver three loads
		each day.</p></li>
		<li><p style="widows: 2; orphans: 2; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
		Adult
		members of the community paid a poll taxes or head tax.  Property
		owners paid a property tax. In addition, each property owner was,
		by statue, expected to contribute time to the maintenance of roads.
		 Statute labor, or stated labour, could include cutting trees or
		brush, digging ditches, repairing culverts, loading gravel, etc. 
		While I am not sure of the actual allocation of time, the number of
		days varied if the labour was provided by a person with a shovel or
		axe, versus person who hauled gravel with a horse and dump cart. 
		Even fewer days were required of a person with a wagon and team of
		horses.</p></li>
		<li><p style="widows: 2; orphans: 2; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
		Occasionally
		a district would be provided with a road scraper, much like the
		road graders of today, except pulled by a two or four horse team.</p></li>
		<li><p style="widows: 2; orphans: 2; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
		Bridges
		and culverts were built of wood. The crib for the Millers Bridge at
		Little Branch, for example, was probably typical and consisted of
		large log crib, probably “cedar” 8-12 inches in diameter; the
		length of the log depended on the width of the road.  The crib was
		filled with rock. 
		</p></li>
		<li><p style="widows: 2; orphans: 2; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
		Culverts
		or bridges leading into properties were also boxes constructed of
		cedar, about 4x4 as I recall, forming an opening perhaps 18 x 24
		inches</p></li>
	</ul>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><b>Dogs
	and porcupine quills</b></p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">A
	confrontation between a dog and a porcupine usually ended up with
	the dog getting a face full of porcupine quills.  Obviously, they
	had to be removed; it was a painful process.  Porcupine quills have
	a barb, something like a fish hook, so that they would not pull out
	easily.  I never did see them being removed but recall the yelps
	from the dog during such an operation.  Ken remembers two men
	holding our dog while Dad removed the quills with a pair of pliers.</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><b>Time
	to Celebrate</b></p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Regular
	readers may recall that Family Chronicle No 27 included a list of
	original land grants along the Black River including the Little
	(Branch) Black River.  June 3, 2012 will mark the 200<sup>th</sup>
	anniversary.   Lots granted that day included both sides of the
	Little Branch (Black) River and the main river as far as Church or
	Gunn’s Point. It is likely that a number of settlers were living
	on their grants for a number of years before the grant was actually
	made. 
	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">A
	200<sup>th</sup>
	anniversary deserves a special celebration, a parade, a dinner,
	genealogy presentations, church service, unveiling of a memorial, a
	history tour, school reunions and more.   Planning needs to start
	now; two years will slip by very quickly.</p>
