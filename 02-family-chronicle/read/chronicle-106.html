<p><b><i>The Outhouse</i></b></p>

<p><b>"</b><i>And it shall come to pass, that instead of sweet smell there shall be stink…"</i></p>
<p><i>[</i><span><i>Isaiah</i></span><i> 3:24]</i><i></i></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>My grandparents' house saw many firsts.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was the first house in Upper Black River to have a telephone, the first to have electricity, the first to have running hot water, and the first to have an indoor toilet.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Of course the toilet and the light bulbs and the hot water depended on the electricity, and that came from a generator that rarely worked.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Thus we basked in firsts but like everyone else in Black River we used kerosene lamps and bathed in a bathtub filled by lugging up stairs water heated in the kitchen wood stove. Youngsters weren't worth the lugging, and were thought to have not much dignity, and so late on Saturdays they were bathed in a zinc washtub set in the middle of the kitchen floor, youngest first. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>In the most private of moments everyone resorted to an outdoor privy and chamber pots. Chamber pots could be quite fancy.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Every home in Black River had one or more wash stands, each containing a small bowl for washing, a water pitcher, a wastewater bowl, and a chamber pot.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Today these are just for show, but when I was a boy these were the hallmarks of a well kept home and a public display that cleanliness is next to Godliness. Given the circumstances and the equipment, we were about as clean as could be expected.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>For that matter, we were probably about as Godly as could be expected, all things considered.</p>
<p>I was always too young to be trusted with carrying a brimming chamber pot downstairs and outside to wherever filled pots went to, and so I know nothing about that end of the business, nor to this day do I care to. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Outhouses, privies, were small clapboard or shingled buildings; ours was whitewashed inside and out, rather elegant touches. Outhouses had a door, and running along the back there was a low bench that usually had two holes--a larger one for adults and a smaller one for children. It took only one mistake for a child to know which hole to use. There were exceptions to the outhouse law of simplicity. I knew of one outhouse where the holes were covered by a hinged lid, and I once saw an outhouse with real toilet seats.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Outhouse amenities were few.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There were nails for hanging clothes, an Eaton's catalog, and a bucket containing quicklime and a small scoop. The catalog provided reading for those sitting, and the catalog's underwear advertisements provided inspiration for those standing. Sitters used the softer pages of the catalog, but a new catalog was never available until sitters had to resort to the hard glossy pages.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When there were guests, there might be toilet paper, although I never saw any in anyone else's outhouse.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Scoops of lime were sprinkled on the "night soil" to hasten decomposition and keep down the odor.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Some outhouses also had a stick that was rattled around in the latrine hole to scare away any real or imagined creature that might do you harm, or, if the soil pit was not completely enclosed, to shoo the occasional chicken out of harm's way.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The front door to the outhouse had a small opening to admit light; usually the opening was a carved half moon, an ancient symbol for female.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Early estates had two outhouses--one for females and one for males; the male door carving was a sunburst.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Our one-room schoolhouse in Black River had an outhouse with separate doors for separate two-holers for boys and girls; I don't remember what symbols or words were on the doors, probably "Boys" and "Girls."<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>At night it didn't matter what your symbol was, you had to have a lantern, and for that purpose one was kept close by the door nearest to the path to the outhouse. On winter nights, of course, there was always the chamber pot. There was probably some etiquette covering guests' use of the chamber pot, and I would like to know it.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The bottom part of the rear outside of the outhouse was hinged to provide access when it was time to shovel out and cart away the night soil. Some folks believed that this soil was the best fertilizer for the kitchen garden, while others were so leery of that notion that they declined to dine at homes where this was the practice. As far as I know, it was not the practice at our home.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I hope not. But then I've been living in cities for quite a while.</p>
<p>Proof of this is my discomfort with my use of the word "dine" two lines above--I don't think folks in Black River ever "dined" anywhere.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Most outhouses were situated below the level of well water, an aromatic distance from the house, and as privately placed as space, getting there time, and terrain allowed. My Uncle Dick Watling's house had what I thought to be the best of all outhouses in that it was indoors.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You went from their kitchen into a series of attached barns, and at the end of one barn floor was the privy--one could scarcely call it an outhouse.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Thus users were at all times sheltered from the elements.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Moreover, if memory serves me right, there were <i>four</i> holes! Intriguing.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Today outhouses are objects of fun, hillbilly symbols, marks of backward people living in primitive conditions.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But to my way of thinking, outhouses and chamber pots are hallmarks of democracy, dispose-alls for false modesty, examples of simplicity and practicality, essential parts of the down to earth system that forged the unassuming, self-reliant folks I knew as a youngster in Black River, New Brunswick.</p>

<p><b>Editor’s Note</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>One time my mother was expecting company, probably relatives from the “Boston States”, and purchased toilet paper for the “two-holer” which sat at the end of the barn about 100 feet from our back door.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Anticipating their arrival shortly, Mother carried the roll of paper to the outhouse placing it on the seat within easy reach.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>All was ready.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She returned the house, likely to check on the meal.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Thinking she heard a car drive in, Mother opened the door to see if the company arrived.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They hadn’t, but in the yard before her eyes were streamers of toilet paper stretched from the outhouse to the barn door, to the truck wagon, etc.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The children thought that decorating the barnyard was fun.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A pretty sight but not what Mother had in mind.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Fortunately she had bought a second roll.</p>
