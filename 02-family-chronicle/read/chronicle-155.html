<p><span></span><b>THE WATLING FAMILY (An Update)</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Origin of Watling Name</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>It is thought that the Watlings were Vikings who landed in Northern Scotland in 870 AD, invaded northern France in 910 AD and then came to England with William the Conqueror in 1066.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The name is found in the Domesday Book which was a census taken in England in 1086. The first record of the name Watling was found in Sussex, England somewhere between London and Dover.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is likely that the name arises from Wartling which was a hamlet in the area but others believe that it was associated with Watling Road. By the time of Richard 1, the Watling name had spread north to Watlingford in Oxfordshire, Watlington in Norfolk, Essex and Hertfordshire.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Many Norman families moved north to Scotland in the 12th century and this might have included some Watlings.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The Roger Watling Website includes the following comments about the origin of the Watlings:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>"In the 5th/6th century a band of people crossed the North Sea from Europe to the British Isles, we do not know if it was one or more boats, but as a yachtsman sailing these waters I would suppose the latter, there being safety in numbers.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They knew where they were going as trading was and had taken place long before, also they would have had oral stories from their forbearers who might have served in the Roman Legions, without a shred of evidence I like to think that they were Angles, or possibly Jute in origin rather than Saxon.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The leader of this band was WACEAL, and those with him of the same clan, tribe or group were the Waceal - ingas.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Ingas was not the son of as in the Scottish Watson, but meaning people of or followers of Waceal, so members of this group would be referred to as Wacelaingas.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As time past the name began to change from, the vowels hardening, or softening, plus the input of people from other tongues and one form was Waselin.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The earliest records I have are for Norfolk 1086, the DOOM'D DAY BOOK.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In this book is recorded the Manor in the Half Hudred Diss, today scholars call it a lost Manor as its whereabouts are unknown.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>(I have my own theory, but that is another story) The Manor of Watlingeseta it states was held by the king (William in 1086, and before 1066 Edward the Confessor).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Also recorded in the book is Wazalin who held land in Weeting, Norfolk, one of the few Anglo Saxons still holding land after William the Bastard and his bunch of land grabbing thugs won the Battle of Hastings.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Watling Street was built by the Romans during their occupation and the name came after the Roman period, the present day town of St. Albans was originally Watlingcaster, but after the martyrdom of St. Alban the name changed, it can be supposed that the Wacealingas lived there.”</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Watling Street</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Watling Street was a major Road in England built by the Romans after they invaded Britain in 55 BC.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It started at Reculver, near Dover, passing through Canterbury (where a street sign bears the name) and on to London and points north.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>From London, Watling Road runs north and west passing through St. Albans<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>(ancient Verulamium) a distance of about 200 km.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>An Internet source says that Watling Road ran from Dover to North Wales.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Watling Emigration</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>From my reading, I learn, but certainly cannot prove, that kinsmen of the family Watling who came to North America include: Frances Watling who settled in Virginia in 1660, John Watling who landed in America in 1753, Mary Watlington settled in Antigua in 1759, James Watling settled in Philadelphia in 1842, Some Watlings are said to have moved to Canada after the American Revolution.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A book, The Fatal Shore, by Robert Hughes, about the history of Australia mentions Thomas Watling, from Dumfries, Scotland, who was transported to Australian 1792 for forging notes on the Bank of Scotland; Watling became a landscape painter and apparently, his art is well known in Australia today.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When I travel, I often check local phone books for family names; Watling must be one of the rarest.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Pious Pirate</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Watling Castle sits on Sandy Point in San Salvador Island which is part of the Bahamas.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The island was originally named Watling's Island in honour of Captain George Watling, a famous buccaneer and pirate.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>(It was renamed in 1926).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Watling was also known as the pious pirate because he would not allow his crew to play cards or indulge in piracy on the Sabbath.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The name Watling appears frequently in literature about the Bahamas.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There may have also been a pirate named John Watling.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I am sure that neither of these were part of our family. <span>(&lt;http://www.bahamasnet.com/sansalvador.html&gt;)</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Our Watlings</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>My search led me to Suffolk, England, where the name of Jubal, Susan (Susannna?) and their family appear in the records of Sylleham; Jubal's actual birthplace, however, was Brockdish, Norfolk.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Suffolk County was described in 1812 as follows:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>"Suffolk, an English COUNTY<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>&lt;http://www.genuki.org.uk/big/eng/SFK/map.html&gt; 47 miles in length and 30 miles in breadth, bounded on the West by Cambridgeshire, on the North by Norfolk, on the South by Essex and on the East by the German Ocean. It contains 575 parishes, 28 market towns and sends 16 members to Parliament. The air is generally wholesome, but the soil is various, on the sea coast it is sandy and there are several small hills which yield hemp, pease and rye. The inland parts are clayey and more full of trees. The borders towards Essex are fit for pastures and the NW produces corn of all sorts. There are manufactures of several kinds, particularly all sorts of broad-cloth, stuffs and coarse linen. The principal rivers are Little Ouse, the Waveney, the Stour, The Breton, the Orwell or Gippe, the Ore and the Blyth. Ipswich and St.Edmundsberry are the principal towns".</p>
<p>From "The Complete and Universal Dictionary" by Rev James Barclay - 1812</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Jubal's Ancestors</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>An internet based Watling Genealogy Group<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>has speculated that Jubal Watling may be the son of Samuel Harper Watling &amp; Susanna. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>NOTE</b>: Some dates, although shown as birth dates, are likely dates of baptisms since it was not unusual, I am told, to have several members of a family baptized at the same time. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
