	<p align="justify"><i>BLACK
	RIVER BRIDGE (Special) - James A. Watling, 95, died Friday at Hotel
	Dieu Hospital, Chatham, after a lengthy illness.</i></p>
	<p align="justify"><i>Born
	in Black River Bridge, he was the son of the late Jubal and Grace
	(MacDonald) Watling.  He had been a farmer and, for 42 years was a
	smelt buyer for W. S. Loggie Co. of Chatham.  He was also the first
	leader of the 4H Club in the area, a charter member and board member
	of the former Newcastle creamery, now Northumberland Co-Op.  He was
	also a member of St. Paul's Presbyterian Church, Black River Bridge,
	an elder of the church for 62 years and treasurer of the presbytery
	for a time.  His wife, the former Katherine Mills, died in 1965.</i></p>
	<p align="justify"><i>He is survived by a daughter,
	Mrs. Alvin Young (Marjorie) of Loggieville; four sons, Winfield, Roy
	and George, all of Moncton, and Neil Watling with whom he resided;
	16 grandchildren, and by 9 great-grandchildren.</i></p>
	<p align="justify"><i>The
	body will be at Adams Funeral Home, Chatham, after 7 p.m. today. 
	The funeral service will be held at 2 p.m. Monday at St. Paul’s
	Presbyterian Church.  Interment will be in the Black River
	Cemetery.&quot;</i></p>

	<p align="justify">What’s
	a “buckety wade?</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">I
	am not sure of the word or it’s spelling but didn’t we call a
	teeter-totter a buckety wade?  Seems that we made ours with a 2x6
	plank over a fence or gate, or perhaps a sawhorse. (A 2x4 was not
	strong enough.)  In order to balance the plank, the lighter person
	would move a bit closer to the end of the plank.  A great
	demonstration of one of the laws of physics.

	<h2>Fowlie’s Mill</h2>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>Among my
	notes, I found a clipping entitled “150 years ago - 1828”. 
	Presumably it was from a Miramichi paper.</p>
	<p> 
	</p>
	<h1>“<i><b>Foul play suspected</b></i></h1>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify"><i>The
	grist and saw mills of Little Black River owned by Mrs. Fowlie, were
	totally consumed by fire on the 10</i><sup><i>th</i></sup><i>
	Feb. There was a large quantity of wheat, flour and oatmeal in the
	mill at the time, which was all consumed, together with everything
	on the premises.  </i>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><i>From
	all the information we are able to glean, there is every reason to
	apprehend that it was the work of an incendiary.  The fire in the
	stove was carefully put out early the preceding evening, and when
	the fire was discovered the next morning, the flames were issuing
	from the opposite end of the building to where the stove stood.</i></p>
	<p align="justify"><i>The loss of property will be from 800 pounds
	to 1000 pounds.”</i></p>
	<p><br />

	<p><i><b>Quality</b></i></p>

	farm roots may enjoy the following:</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>“<i><b>If you wasn’t nice, clean oats, you must pay a fair
	price; however if you can be satisfied with oats that have already
	come through the horse – that comes a little cheaper!!”</b></i></p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<h3>Ironing clothes</h3>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">Clothes
	were not wrinkle free; they had to be ironed or pressed by hand and,
	as I recall, sheets and pillowcases, dresses, shirts and most other
	clothes were ironed every time they were washed.</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">Irons
	were heated on the wood stove, the main source of all heat - same
	one used for cooking, warming the house and heating water.  Once
	plans were made to iron, the irons would be moved to the front of
	the stove.  Irons usually came in sets of three with a handle that
	could be easily switched from one to the other; two would be heating
	while one was being used.    One had to be sure that there was no
	dirt on the iron otherwise the item would have to be washed again –
	and always by hand.</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">Walter
	courted Agnes, as I recall, practically every night of the week. 
	This meant a fresh shirt both washed and ironed – and he always
	wore a white shirt.</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">If
	clothes were too dry, a bit of water would be sprinkled on them.  A
	water sprinkler was made from a vanilla bottle.  Holes were punched
	with a nail in the metal cap, water was put in the bottle, and the
	clothes were sprinkled as needed.</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">Men’s
	pants had to be pressed regularly.  The pants were laid on the
	ironing board.  A piece of damp cloth was laid over the inside of
	the leg.  The dampness helped set the crease in the pants.  Ironing
	without using a damp cloth, I was told, caused pants to become
	shiny.  
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">Prior
	to 1919, my Mum and Dad lived and worked in the USA and, because
	many of his projects involved hydroelectric dams, they usually had
	electricity.  Among Mother’s possessions, was an electric iron. 
	It sat in a box well hidden in a closet.  Electricity came to Little
	Branch in, I believe, October 1948.  The electric iron was brought
	from storage, plugged in and, a major labour saving device sprang to
	life.</p>
