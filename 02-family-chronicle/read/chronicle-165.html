	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">I’ve
	just returned from my annual fall visit to Black River and, as is my
	custom, managed to tour most of the area including the road to
	MacBeath’s Bridge (no longer there, I’m told) and Wells Brook
	(once called Walls Brook; I wonder why the change?) 
	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">While
	there, Brother Ken and I visited relatives in Canobie and Bathurst;
	the next day, I had a brief visit with Everard and Bertie MacLean to
	pass along regards to Everard from a relative in Bathurst who served
	with him during WW2.  
	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">During
	the conversation, Everard mentioned the “dry hill”.  Hadn’t
	heard that expression for a long time.  Those who traveled the
	McKnight/Loggieville road would know that it referred to the high
	point between the Cameron Bridge and Carmel United Church – where
	the gravel pit is, I believe...

	<p style="orphans: 2; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%; widows: 2">
	I referred earlier to a
	“hotel” in Black River; more accurately, it was likely an inn or
	half-way house and I believe that it was located at the forks on the
	Little Black (Branch) River.  (A half-way house was a country inn
	where horses and travelers could stop for a noon meal or stay
	overnight.  Accommodation would likely have been in bunks in a
	common room although there would likely have been a single room or
	two as well.  It is my understanding that the Mackenzie Road from
	Little Branch to Route 11, The Richibucto road, was the main artery
	between Richibucto and Bay du Vin.  In fact, and I think that it
	carried that name officially until the 1940’s.

	</p>
	<p style="orphans: 2; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%; widows: 2">
	According to some census
	information passed to me by Shirley Mackay, the inn was being
	operated in 1851 by William Gibson and his family but later passed
	into the hands of people by the name of Currins. Currins was the
	census taker’s spelling; the name may actually have been Kierans,
	Curran, Cairns, or ???</p>

	following was written as a follow-up to Don Glendenning’s
	“Mother’s apron,” printed in </i><i><u>Family
	Chronicle</u></i><i>
	#116 (April; 18, 2006).</i></p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><i>Aprons
	have been around for a very long time.  </i>
	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><i>Adam’s
	and Eve’s eyes “were opened, and they knew that they were naked:
	and they sewed the leaves together, and made themselves aprons”
	(</i><i><u>Genesis
	</u></i><i>3:7).</i></p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><i>Curiously,
	the word “apron” does not appear in the Index and Concordance to
	the King James Bible.</i></p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><i>In
	addition to Adam, over time lots of men wore aprons—farriers,
	glassblowers, surgeons, chefs, shoe-makers, butchers, Napoleon’s
	sappers, Freemasons, and the like, but for most of history. Aprons
	were worn by women.  The upper classes of course did not wear them
	(although some of their servants did). But then the upper classes
	didn’t carry eggs and apples or lift a pot off a hot stove.  .
	While aprons were utilitarian marvels, they were also useful in
	times of crisis—major and minor.  An apron could be flapped at an
	aggressive farmyard rooster, or waved in the air to signal someone
	working out in a field, or used to fan the face of one in
	discomfort.  At tragic news, an apron could be wrung in the hands,
	an aid in controlling grief and anxiety.  An apron could also be
	used to wipe the tears of a small boy who had stubbed his toe.</i></p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><i>Until
	about forty years ago, practically every advertisement for kitchen
	appliances and household scenes featured an elegant slender woman
	wearing an apron as proof of domestic cleanliness and
	industriousness. Not many housewives wear aprons these days.  They
	may wear a fancy apron for a few minutes when they set out dinner
	for guests, or they may wear a message apron (“Kiss the Cook”). 
	In my experience, more men wear aprons these days, especially when
	it’s barbecue time, and most of these aprons also have messages
	(“She Didn’t Marry Me for My Cooking”).</i></p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><i>When
	I think of my Grammie, grandmother Elspeth MacNaughton, I see her in
	an apron that had no messages written on it.   Grandmothers didn’t
	need messages.  In their plain aprons, they were pictures of order
	and comfort and stability and decency:  they were the nobility of
	the Black River community I knew as a boy.</i></p>

	The last issue of the NBGS
	Miramichi Branch News Letter mentioned a new website, at least new
	to me,  <u><a href="http://www.historicplaces.ca/">www.historicplaces.ca</a></u>
	 I logged on and found it interesting but began to wonder about
	historic places in Black River.

	</p>
	<p style="orphans: 2; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%; widows: 2">
	And then I began to wonder as
	to the oldest homes in Black River.  I really don’t know but have
	an impression that it could be the Frank MacLean place (where Ernie
	and Helen MacLean now live) or the home of Bill and Agnes (MacLean)
	Fowlie.  I would guess that Neil Watling’s home, originally the
	home of John Macdonald, would have been built in the mid 1800’s.</p>
