</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">I
	am at the “clean-up” stage of life and came across some of my
	early handiwork.  I am sure that many readers could do the same.</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Sometime
	between September 1949 and June 1951 I learned to twist and solder
	pigtails; I forgot all about it until I came across a soldering pot
	among my mementos. The above photo shows the soldering pot with the
	wire handle.</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">In
	those days electricians made joints by twisting the ends of wires
	together; these joints were called pigtails and they were commonly
	used in house wiring.  The wires were then coated with resin so that
	the solder would stick.  Because many electrical connections were in
	the ceiling boxes, a normal soldering iron was difficult to use. 
	Instead one heated the soldering pot with a blow torch and then
	pushed it up so that the pigtail was immersed in the solder.</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">I
	made the soldering pot shown in the photo using a pipe coupling with
	a plug screwed into one end and then machined level.  The handle is
	a piece of welding rod.  The soldering pot would swivel as it was
	raised to the ceiling.  Today, wires are joined with connectors.</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">The
	policeman, a lawn ornament, was made in 1944 while a student at
	MRHS.</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">The
	C-clamp and the Vee block were hand made also and part of my
	training while at the New Brunswick Technical Institute in
	1949-1951.  At that time I was learning to become an industrial arts
	teacher.</p>

	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">The
	toolbox shown above was made while a student at MRHS, in Grade 10 I
	think.  The pieces inside the cover were designed to hold two
	handsaws.</p>

	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">The
	drafting case was designed as a portable drafting case and was
	complete unto itself with a T-square, two triangles, a drafting
	scale, and a set of pencils.</p>

	I
	bought my first 35mm camera in 1953 and made the above carrying. The
	slides soon gathered and I made two cases (see photo below) to hold
	my slide cartridges.  Unfortunately, the technology changed and I
	had chosen one that did not survive</p>

	“<i>Your December 3rd
	edition with a piece about my first cousin Fraser MacKay helping you
	with your pattern for window sticks reminded me of my early
	woodworking days.&nbsp; While I don't recall ever making window
	sticks, I do remember Fraser helping me carve a Winchester rifle
	which I hunted with for several years --this, despite my owning a
	.22 rim-fire rifle. There was no woodworking at the Upper Black
	River School, but back in Cambridge, Massachusetts, I did take
	sloyd, a woodworking course with a name that I believe derives from
	Swedish. In sloyd I built a shoeshine box that I still have, and a
	towel roller that has vanished.&nbsp; Towel rollers were a staple in
	every Black River kitchen, and I wonder who made them?&nbsp; Working
	with wood was a constant Black River activity…”</i></p>
