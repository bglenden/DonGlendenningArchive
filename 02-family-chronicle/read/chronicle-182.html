	Mackenzie commented that “As for the picnic group, a few faces
	look familiar. I believe Bessie Edge is standing third from the
	right in the back row. Also, the gentleman in the chair with the
	long black beard on the far right looks like Donald M. Watling
	(James TD and Dick's father) to me. Any ideas on others? I see a
	John W. MacNaughton look-alike as well on the far left”</b></p>

	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Stephen
	was in the artillery.  An undated clipping reads “On the first of

	before Cambrai and Stephen and two of his chums met instant death by
	the landing of a shell.”</p>

	Guy was a machine gunner and received gunshot wounds to the chest at
	Ypres on June 4; wounded at Hill 70 on April 14, 1917; wounded again
	at Cambrai on October 1, 1918, and was mentioned in Haig's
	dispatches of November 8, 1918.</p>

	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Recently
	someone gave me a ”heads up” on an upcoming event.  It is a word
	I don’t hear very often but it reminded me of the summer of 1946
	when I worked loading pulp and pitprops on the “boats” on the
	Miramichi.</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Steamers
	were loaded, as I recall, at Ritchie’s, O’Brien’s, and the
	Newcastle wharf in Newcastle, Milbank Wharf where the ferry docked
	and the railway wharf in Chatham... Pulp was ground up in pulp mills
	to make paper; pitprops, usually from 5-8 feet in length, were
	shipped to coal mines to brace walls and ceilings and prevent
	cave-ins.</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Mostly
	I worked in the field loading pulp onto trucks that had a specially
	designed rack to allow a sling to be attached when they reached the
	wharf.  We usually started work 15 minutes before the men on the
	boats.  
	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">At
	the wharf, a sling load of “props” was hoisted and swung over
	the vessel, then lowered it into the hold.  Men in the hold would
	then move the individual pieces in under the decks until the holds
	were filled.  None of the pieces were light but I especially
	remember the weight of some 8-foot props that were soggy and
	mildewed.</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">There
	was always a danger that the sling would unhook or break, or that a
	loose prop would plummet down into the hold, therefore, as the sling
	was about to swing over the hold, the stevedore would call out
	“heads up in the hold”.  On hearing that, we would scramble away
	from the opening where the props were about to be lowered.</p>

	<b>Spruce Gum</b></p>
	<p style="orphans: 2; widows: 2; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
	<br />

	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; widows: 2; orphans: 2; line-height: 100%">
	Occasionally when walking in
	my woods I see, and sometimes chip off, spruce gum.  When spruce
	trees are injured, sap seeps out; when the sap hardens it is known
	as spruce gum.  Generally it takes about four years for it to harden
	enough to be chewable.  I remember my older brothers bringing home
	spruce gum when they would be working in the woods.  
	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; widows: 2; orphans: 2; line-height: 100%">
	<br />

	</p>
	<p style="orphans: 2; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%; widows: 2">
	Aboriginals used spruce gum
	for medicinal purposes but also to repair their birch bark canoes. 
	In the early 18-1900’s, spruce gum was manufactured in both
	eastern Canada and eastern USA.  Canadian manufacturers included
	Row’s of St. Stephen, NB and Melanson’s of Church Point, Nova
	Scotia.</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; widows: 2; orphans: 2; line-height: 100%">
	<br />

	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; widows: 2; orphans: 2; line-height: 100%">
	Spruce Gum has a very unique
	taste.  Whereas, commercial gum can be chewed and chewed and chewed,
	Spruce gum quickly gets hard when being chewed.</p>

	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">“Wheat
	flour was considered better than flour made from other types of
	grain, and it was often more expensive.  Housewives who wished to
	impress others used the best flour for the upper crust of their pies
	because it could be seen and admired.  The phrase “upper crust”
	refers to someone or something that is rich and fancy.</p>
