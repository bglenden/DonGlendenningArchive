	The top photo is of a Massey
	Harris grain binder owned by Bernard Keefe, Cherry Valley, PEI.  The
	age is not known but I believe it to be manufactured in the 1930s or
	even earlier.  The binder includes a set of canvasses but they are
	being kept in dry storage.</p>

	The second photo is of a
	manure spreader that is part of the collection at the agricultural
	museum at Orwell corner, PEI.  I could not find any discernable
	markings so do not know the make or the year.  It is certainly an
	older model than we had on our farm in the 1940s.  Readers will note
	that the front wheels turn like car wheels rather than the older
	versions where the front wheels pivoted.</p>

	The third photo is of a set
	of disc harrows used for cutting/breaking up sod after plowing. 
	Readers will note a wooden box mounted on top of the harrows to hold
	stone as extra weight for heavy sod.</p>

	The last photo is of a horse
	hoe used for making drills in the vegetable garden.  Notice the
	angle of the handles; this allowed the farmer to walk to the side of
	a drill.  The angle could be changed.  A horse hoe was also used to
	“mold” or hill the rows of potatoes after the tops had appeared
	above the ground.</p>

	An article in our local
	Seniors Paper reminded me of yesteryear.  School books/texts were
	scarce and were passed down in the family.  As I recall, some of my
	texts were used by sister, Elinor, and brothers Kenneth and Norman. 
	Because they were passed down to younger family members, one seldom
	made notes in the margins or underlined the text.  I am still
	reluctant to mark a book I am reading.</p>

	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; widows: 2; orphans: 2; line-height: 100%">
	As well, textbooks were
	frequently covered to help keep them clean.  Covers could be brown
	paper, unused wall paper or even oil cloth.  At the beginning of the
	next year, the new “owner” simply replaced the cover and the
	book was almost as good as new.</p>

	Of course, remember when each

	Then we had carbon paper so
	one writing would provide a number of copies.  I am not sure that
	one could make more than three or four carbon copies at once - a far
	cry from when every I was talking with a friend recently about all
	the paper used for photocopying.  And of course, carbon paper, and
	carbon copies were so messy.  One soon had carbon over one fingers
	and sometimes on ones hands.</p>

	I started teaching in
	Kouchibouguac in 1947 and purchased from Moyer School supplies in
	Moncton a gelatin-based copier.  My recollection is a bit hazy but I
	believe the basis was a small tin box, a bit like a cookie sheet but
	only about nine by fifteen inches.</p>

	One used a gelatin like
	liquid (I think that we warmed it and used it over and over) and
	poured it into the pan.  Using a special pencil, purplish in colour,
	one wrote the original.  One placed the original with the printed
	side down; it left a copy of the document in reverse on the gelatin.
	 Then one laid fresh white paper on the gelatin and the copy was
	transferred to it.</p>

	In 1948 I taught at MRHS and
	we had a Gestetner copier.  One cut a stencil, literally, and
	inserted it into the Gestetner.  As one turned the handle, the
	machine picked up a clean piece of paper and the ink flowed through
	the stencil to make the copy.  Ours was operated using a crank;
	later ones were powered by electricity.</p>

	As a result of an earlier
	Newsletter, I had a letter from a woman in Minnesota recalling her
	childhood and going with her father on a set of bobsleds.  She
	wondered if I had any photos; I don’t.  <b>Do
	you?</b>  If you do, I
	would love to have a copy – send me the original and I will return
	it, send me a copy or send it electronically.  I will include it in
	a future newsletter.</p>
