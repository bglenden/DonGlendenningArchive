<p><b><i>On Reaching 100</i></b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Yes, this is Issue 100.</b><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Reaching 100 was never an objective but has become a milestone and, I think, therefore, is worthy of reflection.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Issue No. 1, on May 5, 1997 stated:</p>
<p><b><i></i></b><br></p>
<p><b><i>“The Chronicle is an occasional Newsletter devoted to genealogy… Its purpose is to both share and seek information.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It will be published from time to time as the spirit moves me…</i></b></p>
<p><b><i></i></b></p>
<p><b>Background</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I had started gathering information about the Glendenning side of my family some fifty years ago.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My starting point was a Bible belonging to my Great-Grandfather, John Glendinning, who emigrated from Scotland in 1830.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Next, I contacted the Scottish Ancestry Research Society in Edinburgh, Scotland. Later, I distributed a questionnaire to my aunts and uncles on my father’s side of the family. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Then, followed a long period during which I did very little except maintain my database.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>On reaching retirement age, I picked up the threads and began gathering information again. I now had information to share with siblings when we met.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Siblings were, or seemed to be, interested in the information, so I developed the Family Chronicle devoted, as noted above, to spreading information about my family especially ancestors.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Later I began to share information to my extended family and friends via Email.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>More recently, my son, Brian, established a website, provided space and offered upload all issues.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I stopped distributing by Email. <span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>A while back, I made a conscious effort to add recollections of life in Black River when I was growing up.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I seldom research a topic; I write as the spirit moves me.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Sometimes on reading earlier articles, I wish that I had provided more in some articles.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Maybe I will reprint and elaborate on some of the topics.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>As a youngster, I was intrigued with the number of folks in Black River to whom I was related.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Those relationships interest me.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I am also interested in the families of neighbours.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>. I have a surprising amount of information about early Black River families.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If time permits, it would be interesting to complete a list of neighbours along the river when I was a lad. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Perhaps, I have not given as much attention to grammar or style as I should have.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I tell myself that I am writing for myself not for others.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Furthermore, if readers enjoy the letter, they will excuse my mistakes. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>The Experience</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The Family Chronicle is just a newsletter; it is like writing a letter to a friend – in this case, a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>letter that goes to a number of friends at the same time.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It reflects my thinking when I sit to write.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Topics arise from my reading, from conversations and from suggestions received from readers or friends.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My distant readers, some relatives and some not, write from such places as Australia, California. Connecticut, British Columbia.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Some readers pass on copies to neighbours and friends; others tell me that they receive copies from neighbours who I do not even know.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I appreciate those comments.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I’ve thought about writing a book but that would require a different mind set and greater discipline; I do not rule out the idea but that is not part of my present plan.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Through the column, I’ve made contact again with “lost” relatives – I’ve also met “new” relatives and new friends. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Life has been good to me and I have many fond memories of growing up in Black River; these are the ones I want to record and pass along.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As a matter of interest, my passport shows my place of birth as “Little Branch” and that passport has taken me to nearly 40 countries.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Acknowledgements</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>Many people have responded to my cries for help.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>First and foremost, I must thank my siblings who over the years were most generous with their time and information. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>often in the form of answers to questions, sometimes just being polite as I steered<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>conversation to family matters.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Most of the photos were found among my mother’s things; more recently, thanks to Venetia’s family, I was able to add to my bank of photos.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Most recently, conversations with brothers Kenneth and Norman have sparked items for the Newsletter; and Ken has been most patient when I decide to stop at a cemetery or visit a library.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Ken has also located clippings and photos many of which have been included or are ready for inclusion.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Thanks for information also to George Watling, Marjorie (Watling) Young, Tina (Watling) Newton, Art Mills, Ernie MacLean, Harold MacLean, Jack Wilson, Jennie Foley and the many others too numerous to mention.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Thanks also for both information and support. A special thanks to Donald Edge for his questions, comments and insight.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Donald has also recorded interesting memories of life in Black River. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Whither bound?</b><b></b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>With this issue, I intend to put together a few copies and place them in both the New Brunswick and National archives.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Then, I plan to continue my writing.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There is no shortage of information.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In fact, my files are overflowing with information that triggers memories.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I have more information in them today than ever before. The problem is in finding time to write.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>As some readers know, I am also working on a list of all families in Black river when I was a lad – approximately 120 families from the Meadows to Victoria Bridge.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
