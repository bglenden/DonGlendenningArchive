	<b>Norman
	Peters Glendenning </b>was
	born on New Year’s Eve, 1925, however, when the birth was
	registered, it was given as December 31, 1926.  Grandmother
	Glendenning was a Peters hence his second name.   According to
	Lillian, Mum and Dad had difficulty deciding between the names
	Norman and Robert.

	Norman
	attended the Little Branch School, classes in the Anglican Church in
	Bay du Vin and the Miramichi Rural High School.  Before school bus
	service was established, Norm used to take a horse to Bay du Vin,
	and later Bayside, picking up other students along the way.  The
	horse was stabled for the day in either Goymer Williston’s or

	Norm
	was a good skater and a good dancer, and usually took me along when
	I first started going to dances in 1946. I also remember working
	with Norm at the hay; in the woods on cold and snowy Saturdays;
	butchering and peddling meat; shearing and dipping sheep and
	whatever else needed to be done.  I know that I’ve already told
	the story of Norm bringing home several sheep in the back of the old
	Model A.

	Norm
	taught me to drive.  Once, I backed out of the barn ok but in
	turning to clear the hay press, I went too far and ran into the
	house.  Fortunately, I did not do much damage.</p>

	<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
	Among
	Norm’s stories is one about Wallace MacDonald throwing a peavey at
	him and Edwin Adams, trips on icy roads up river with Mr. Harper to
	tend to a sick horse and the first time he drove a vehicle with
	airbrakes.</p>

	and
	Eric.  Alton and Eric now operate the farm although Norm continues
	to “supervise” and run errands; most every day he makes a trip
	to Miramichi City.  Branchview, the Glendenning farm, is the largest
	farm east of Miramichi and one of the largest in the Miramichi area.
	 Branchview has been the recipient of a number of awards.

	Norman
	and Jean always welcome family to the old family home providing a
	place at the table for children, siblings, grandchildren, nephews
	and nieces alike.  He always tells visiting children where the
	kittens were and offers to give them one to take home.  Many young
	people of the community earned some money and learned important work
	habits while working on the farm with Norman and the “boys”.
