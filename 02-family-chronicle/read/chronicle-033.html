	<p style="orphans: 2; widows: 2"><br />

	<p style="orphans: 2; widows: 2"><img src="img/chronicle-033/img002.jpg" align="bottom" />
</p>
	<p style="widows: 2; orphans: 2">Photo
	of Venetia taken by Loisanne (Glendenning) Gregan at Ken and Verne’s
	cottage in Point Aux Carr, NB on July 27, 2002.</p>
	<p style="widows: 2; orphans: 2"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="orphans: 2; widows: 2"> Venetia was
	born at Little Branch.  Mum and Dad had purchased the property from
	Jessie MacDonald, where Norman now lives, had returned to Little
	Branch and were running the Post Office.  In late 1916, they left
	New Brunswick for North Haven, Ct and in the next few years lived in
	Hampton Virginia and Muscle (Mussel) Shoals, Alabama, returning to
	Little Branch, I believe, in May of 1919.  In Virginia, Venetia’s
	father was in charge of the clearing of Langley Field which, I
	believe, handled both sea and land based airplanes.  It being a
	defense establishment, people needed passes to visit.  A year or so
	ago, Venetia showed me her pass, dated as I recall, 1918.</p>
	<p style="widows: 2; orphans: 2"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="orphans: 2; widows: 2">Venetia
	attended the Little Branch School for Grades 1-8, the highest grade
	available in the Little Branch School, and then she 
	</p>
	<p style="orphans: 2; widows: 2">stayed with
	Aunt Tine in Loggieville where she completed Grade nine.  As was the
	custom of the day, she wrote Entrance Exams and gained First Class
	Entrance to 
	</p>
	<p style="orphans: 2; widows: 2"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="orphans: 2; widows: 2">the
	Provincial Normal School from which she graduated in 1933.</p>
	<p style="orphans: 2; widows: 2"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="orphans: 2; widows: 2">I believe
	that she taught in New Carlysle, Napan, Penniac and Bayside; she may
	also have taught somewhere north of Fredericton.  She also taught in
	Point Aux Carr, Little Branch, Miramichi Rural High School and
	Chatham retiring in 1975.  Quite a number of people at her wake
	mentioned that Venetia had been their teacher.</p>
	<p style="orphans: 2; widows: 2"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="orphans: 2; widows: 2">Venetia was
	active in her church, St. Paul’s Presbyterian.  I am sure that she
	was also in Sunday School at St. Stephen’s Presbyterian Church
	prior to it becoming St. Stephen’s United Church.  Venetia was
	President of the Young Peoples Society and the local paper,
	presumably the Chatham Gazette, noted, “Miss Venetia Glendenning,
	President Black River Y.P.S, in a very pleasing manner welcomed the
	delegates…” I believe that this was at a Young People’s rally
	prior to the official opening in 1930.</p>
	<p style="orphans: 2; widows: 2"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="orphans: 2; widows: 2">Venetia was a
	member of St. Paul’s since its establishment, played the organ for
	many years and for 40 years was Church Treasurer.  She was also a
	member of the Women’s Missionary Society and the Women’s League.</p>
	<p style="orphans: 2; widows: 2"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="orphans: 2; widows: 2">Venetia met
	Cameron Russell (1906-1979) in the spring of 1932 at Little Branch. 
	Cam was rafting logs for Harrison Murdoch and they tied up at the
	wharf.  Cam, and perhaps other members o;f the crew came over to
	talk to the girls in the schoolyard.  They married in St. Paul’s
	Presbyterian Church and lived in Point Aux Carr in a home they

</p>
	<p style="widows: 2; orphans: 2">Standing:
	Walter, Grace and Venetia; Lillian seated; taken in New Haven, Ct.
	probably in late1917.</p>
	<p style="widows: 2; orphans: 2"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="orphans: 2; widows: 2">bought from
	Mrs. Simon MacDonald.  Mrs. MacDonald retained a room which she used
	mainly in the summer.  Cam and Venetia had three children, Glenn,
	Leonard and Donna.</p>
	<p style="orphans: 2; widows: 2"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="orphans: 2; widows: 2">Venetia was
	an avid reader, a good listener and a good sport.  She was a good
	conversationalist but not one to gossip or be critical of others. 
	She demanded nothing, asked little and offered much.  She did not
	complain and was always “fine” when asked about her own health. 
	She did not want to bother people.  She could entertain herself and
	did not mind living alone.  In fact, she lived alone for 20 years
	after she became a widow.</p>
	<p style="orphans: 2; widows: 2"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="orphans: 2; widows: 2">Venetia was a
	resource for information about her community and we shared an
	interest in genealogy; she provided me with much of my initial
	information about the Watling side of the family.  She could recall
	family relationships from memory whereas I have to rely on my notes
	and records.</p>
	<p style="orphans: 2; widows: 2"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="orphans: 2; widows: 2">Venetia and
	Cam had many trips to Florida with Ken and Verne.  When lighting her
	stove to warm the house on return from one trip in 1989 or 1990, the
	house caught fire and burned.  She rebuilt on the same site. 
	Venetia and Cam visited Donna and Vernon when they lived in
	Vancouver and later in England and, while in England, traveled with
	the family by car around Europe. 
	
	</p>
	<p style="widows: 2; orphans: 2"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="orphans: 2; widows: 2">As a
	youngster, I recall the nice table Venetia set at mealtime.  A visit
	to Venetia’s always ended in lunch before leaving.  Sometimes when
	visiting the Miramichi in recent years, I would drop in on Venetia’s
	about 8:00 am and enjoy toast, jam, tea and conversation.  She kept
	scotch cookies in her freezer and always set some out when she knew
	I was coming for a visit.</p>
