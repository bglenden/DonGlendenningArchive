<div class="reader-summary">Follow-up to smelt fishing article with reader correspondence (Glenn Russell, Arthur Mills). References a Mother&#x27;s Day gathering photo at Little Branch showing Don&#x27;s nephews and nieces. Discusses winter boots (gum boots and rubber boots), their ineffectiveness against cold, and a community tradition of &quot;Gumboot Day&quot; competitions. Describes school outhouse etiquette (raising one/two fingers to request permission). Includes period expressions (&quot;slow as cold molasses,&quot; &quot;see a man about a horse,&quot; &quot;the makins&quot; for hand-rolled cigarettes). Nostalgic, folklore-oriented content capturing mid-20th century social habits and vernacular.</div>

	Russell tells me that bag nets were fished on both tides but box
	nets did not have to be fished as often.  Glenn also said that
	fishermen had a devise that rested on the bottom with a string to a
	“bell” sitting on the ice.  The rising tide caused a “clang”
	thereby alerting fishermen to dress, go out and haul their nets.</p>

	Arthur
	Mills wrote I’ve “been there and done that”; it “brought a
	tear to my eye.  What a hard way to make a living. My Dear Dad and
	Uncle Bert would leave&nbsp;Monday morning return on Saturday, an
	exercise they carried out for years. I am more than grateful to
	Mother for never encouraging me to get involved.”

	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><b>Gum
	boots</b></p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Herb
	Curtis has written a number of books set in the Miramichi.  I am
	just starting to read <u>The
	Last Tasmanian</u>
	and it he mentions gum boots; I remember them well.  They were the
	common winter boot.</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">I
	wore gum boots, it seems forever.  They were made of rubber over
	canvas, like a rubber boot, only a gumboot was only ankle high and
	laced where as a rubber boot went to the knee.  Low enough so that
	the snow went over the top and down into the boot making for wet
	feet and, at the end of the day, stinking feet.  Fortunately we had
	a furnace in our house and boots dried out over night.</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Neither
	rubber boots not gumboots offered much protection from the cold;
	thick woolen socks, or perhaps even two, plus felt insoles helped. 
	As I recall, our rubber boots had red trim but I cannot remember if
	that applied also to gum boots.</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Some
	communities, I am told, held an annual celebration called Gumboot
	Day.  One of the competitions was to see how high or how far one
	could throw a gumboot.  To the best of my knowledge, that kind of
	event was not held in Black River.</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><b>Number
	one and number two</b></p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Some
	readers may recall school days during which one raised one’s hand
	for permission to go to the toilet – there was no bathroom but
	there was an outhouse perched on the edge of the bank overhanging
	the cove.  Why it was important for the teacher to know the
	particular toilet function, I do not know but we signaled our
	intention by holding up either one or two fingers.  
	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">One
	finger indicated the need to “pee’ (The Number One function)
	while two fingers indicated the need to “dump” (the Number Two
	function).   
	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">I
	recall also when working in the Miramichi area, it was not uncommon
	to say “I have to see a man about a horse” which translated into
	the need to go to the toilet.  I wouldn’t be surprised if some of
	the old timers in Black River still use the expression.</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><b>Slow
	moving</b></p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">We
	all move at different speeds.  A slow person was said to be “slow
	as cold molasses”; an even slower person was sometimes described
	as “Slow as cold molasses moving up hill in January”.  That was
	very slow, indeed.

	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><b>The
	“makins”</b></p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Most
	smokers I knew rolled their own cigarettes.  One needed a package of
	tobacco and a package of papers; together they were the “makins”.
	 A paper would be removed from the package, bent slightly and held
	in one hand.  A pinch of tobacco would be removed from the package,
	spread the length of the paper then the paper with the tobacco was
	rolled making a cigarette.  The loose end of the paper was wet
	slightly by the tongue and gently pushed against the rolled
	cigarette ensuring that the cigarette would stay rolled.  Any loose
	tobacco at either end was removed and put back in the package.</p>
