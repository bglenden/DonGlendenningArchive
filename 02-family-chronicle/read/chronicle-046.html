	</p>
	<p>Following the last Newsletter, I received a note
	from Art and Enid Mills.  Enid remembered her grandfather having
	sheep and getting yarn in return for the wool.</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>Art sent me a statement of account sent to his
	father, Jasper Mills, by my father, Elmer Glendenning, for 1930 with
	the <b>Black River Agricultural Society No. 103 Dr. and Co-0perative
	Association.</b>  (I am not sure what the Dr. stands for.)”The
	statement dated Sept. 16<sup>th</sup> 1930 had the following
	entries:</p>

	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>As a follow-up, I checked 2003 prices of these
	items in PEI.  Fertilizer, depending on the mix, is from $125-$300
	per ton; timothy seed  $1.17 lb; red clover $1.65 lb; and alsike
	clover is $1.31 lb.</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p><b>Lime and Fertilizer</b></p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>At first, fertilizer and lime came in bulk; later
	one had a choice of bulk or bagged with the latter being more
	expensive.  One bought so many pounds of each component - potash,
	phosphate, nitrogen, etc according whether it was for grain or
	gardens.  I can remember mixing fertilizer on the concrete barn
	floor.  The mix, perhaps a half ton or even a ton, was piled on the
	floor then two men with shovels would methodically shovel the old
	pile into a new pile two or three times.  There was a technique to
	it.</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>Each farmer ordered in advance; then word would
	come that the lime or fertilizer was at the station.  I remember
	just prior to WW2, Walter, John, Ken and Norm leaving with the
	horses and wagons for Loggieville to unload lime.  Farmers would
	come with their horses for their order; the men would shovel the
	lime or fertilizer on to the individual wagons.  Depending on how
	far you lived from Loggieville, you would make one or two trips per
	day.  At the end of the day, the men would put on their own load and
	come home.  Walter nearly always brought me peppermints whenever he
	was working at the lime.</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>Obviously this was a labour intensive operation. 
	First the fertilizer was shoveled from boxcar to wagon, once at
	home, may have had to be shoveled off the wagon, shoveled two or
	three times to mix it and then bagged and taken to the field and
	dumped into the grain or potato seeder for spreading.</p>

	<h6 style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">Potato Bugs</h6>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>I always plant 5-10 pounds of potatoes at my
	cottage – no more than I can use before moving back to town for
	the winter.  Recently I had to deal with an infestation of potato
	bugs (the Colorado potato beetle)</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>First, I
	found a small container, put a bit of kerosene in the bottom and
	picked the bugs into it.  Picking potato bugs at home when I was a
	youngster was not uncommon.  I wasn’t wild about it but it was one
	of the chores to be done.</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>I remember
	also going to the Mac place with John to poison potato bugs.  Ken
	remembers that event also; Norman was likely there also.  This was
	done when the bugs were still quite small and always early in the
	morning (5-5:30 am or so) when there was heavy dew on the plants. 
	The dew was necessary so that the powder would stick to the plants.</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>John would
	mix the poison.  I’m not sure of the mix but think that it
	included lime (slaked or unslaked), “Paris Green” and maybe
	arsenic of lime.  A corner was cut from a feedbag and 10 – 15
	pounds of the mixture place in it.  One took the bag in one’s hand
	and walked along each row giving the bag one shake over each plant. 
	This left a layer of white powder, poison, on top of each plant.  I
	do not ever remember having to go through the field a second time.  
	</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<h6 style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">Glendennings in
	Galloway</h6>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>Loisanne took Norm, Jean and Eileen on an outing
	recently and found themselves at a small cemetery at Galloway near
	Rexton.  They found many Glendinning/Glendenning headstones and many
	with familiar family names – John, Walter, James and William for
	example.  They came from Dumfries shire in Scotland and came to
	Canada just after the turn of the century.  In fact, one person was
	actually born at Glendinning.  This is the area my Great Grandfather
	came from but I was not able to trace any family connection.</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>I am aware
	also of many Glendinnings/ Glendennings who came to Saint John, New
	Brunswick about the same time.  Although I have copies of some
	family histories, again, I was not able to make a family connection.</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<h6 style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">Glendinning,
	Scotland</h6>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>Some of my early Scottish maps show Glendinning
	in Dumfriesshire but it has disappeared from later ones.  In the
	mid-1800s the ruins of a castle could be found but I understand it
	has now completely disappeared.  Glendinning was known for its
	antimony mines.  So far, I have not been able to find any connection
	with my side of the Glendinning clan.</p>
