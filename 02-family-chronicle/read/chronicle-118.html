	<p align="center"><b>Don with
	pups</b></p>
	<p align="justify">Don
	was born at Little Branch on September 8, 1929 and was baptized in
	the new St. Paul’s Presbyterian Church in Black River on opening
	day, July 20, 1930.  Like the rest of the family, he attended the
	Little Branch School; he also graduated from the Miramichi Rural
	High School.</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">He
	completed a six-month teacher training program at Teachers’
	College in Fredericton in June 1947 and his first teaching position
	was at Middle Kouchibouguac.  Over the next few years he mixed
	teaching and study completing a PhD at Indiana University in 1964. 
	He also taught at
	the Miramichi Rural High School and the
	New Brunswick Institute of Technology. In
	1969, after a number of years with the  Federal Government, he moved
	to Prince Edward Island to become the first President of Holland
	College.  He also was active in a number of national professional
	organizations.  
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">After
	retiring from Holland College in 1987, he set up his own company and
	engaged in educational consulting in Canada and abroad.  His
	overseas contracts provided many travel opportunities especially to
	Asia and Africa.</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">Don
	married Carol Chesney from Peoria, Illinois and they have two
	children,, Brian and Janet; Brian married Marie Carota and they have
	two daughters, Lisa and Laura.  Of the family, Carol, Brian, Janet
	and the grandchildren are all dual-citizens of Canada and the USA.</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="left">He was bitten early by the travel
	bug and, either for business or pleasure, visited most every corner
	of Canada, most US states, and 40 countries in all. As a family,
	they lived in Moncton, Bloomington (Indiana), Ottawa, Van-couver and
	now in Charlottetown.  Don and Carol continue to travel and usually
	spend some time each winter in the  southern USA.

	<p align="left"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">Their
	most exotic trip was a  safari in Tanzania, Africa; they also spent
	two weeks as guests of the Peoples’ Republic of China where Don
	delivered a lecture to Chinese College Directors.</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">After
	retirement, Don resumed his interest in genealogy and visited
	Callister Hall, Scotland, where his great grandfather was born in
	1807.  He publishes a Family Chronicle, an informal and occasional
	newsletter, which, thanks to Brian, is posted on the family website.
	 The Newsletter carries both family and personal recollections of
	growing up in Black River.</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p>Retirement activities in include genealogy,
	reading, volunteer work, travel, gardening, writing, letters to the
	editor – and working on his “farm”.  Don was awarded the Order
	of Canada in 1986.</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">Childhood
	memories include picking wild blueberries, mayflowers, cherries,
	plums, strawberries, cranberries and mushrooms; hours spent with
	George Watling playing in and along the brook; our water diversion
	projects during spring run-off; the family going to church by horse
	and wagon; Sunday school under the huge tree in Uncle Jim’s back
	yard; dances in the Black River hall, at Mel Adams hall and
	elsewhere; Saturday nights cruising the streets in Chatham, and many
	more.</p>
