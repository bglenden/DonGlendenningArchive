<p>No. 156									March 28, 2008</p>
<p><span>____________________________________________________________________</span></p>
<p><span></span></p>
<p><span>Editor’s Note</span>: This is the second of three Newsletters dealing primarily with my Watling roots; some of the information is a repeat but some is also new.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p> <b>Jubal and Susanna (Leach) Watling</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Tess Barker, Watling Genealogy Group, reports finding "Metfield marriage: Jubal Watling singleman of Brockdish, Norfolk and Susan Leech, singlewoman, of this parish by banns, 10th November, 1814.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Jubal signed (good handwriting) and Susan marked.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Witnesses:<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Shemus Leech<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>and Peter Archor.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The comment about handwriting is more significant than one might think because it indicates a level of literacy.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>According to some internet discussions, the Watlings were thought to be labourers and, when I reported a Jubal as a “mason” in PEI, <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>the group was quite skeptical.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Seeing his actual handwriting, made them think otherwise.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Family lore says that the Watlings came from England to Prince Edward Island and eventually some moved to Black River, near Chatham, New Brunswick - but we have no record of Jubal and Susanna in New Brunswick. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>My first search on PEI turned up some Watlings but insufficient information to make a family connection.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>With new information about the family generally, however, I searched again for a PEI connection <b><i>and have changed my mind. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></i></b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The census of 1841, shows a Jubal Watling, living in Lot 52, PEI; Lot 52 is in eastern PEI close to Montague and Georgetown; there were 6 people in the household, four of whom were born in England and two in PEI; of the six in the household, four males were under age sixteen, one female between 16 and 45 and one male between 45 and 60; the census records also show that Jubal was a mason and that one of the six had paid his or her passage.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>This fits Jubal and the family since we know that Mary Anne Watling, daughter of Jubal and Susanna, married William Maxwell on July 24, 1834 in St Paul's Anglican Church in Charlottetown and would have, presumably, been living outside the home.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The fact that they were married in the Church of England does not necessarily mean that they were of that denomination since, I am told that the C of E was usually willing to marry couples whether or not they were church members.</p>
<p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>But there is, or may be, a complication. On July 14, 1831, a Jubal and Louisa Watling married in St. Paul Anglican Church, Charlottetown and the marriage record says that Jubal and his wife were "lately" in Norfolk County, England; the female in the household,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>therefore, could be the new wife, Louisa, and not Emily.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If so, where was Emily?</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>We know that Emma/Emily, married William Eddy but we do not know the year; 1841, when the census was taken, Emily would have been 23 years of age. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We do know, however, that they were married and living in Bathurst, New Brunswick by 1847; If they were married before 1841, the 'older" female would be Louisa, the second wife.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I also found a marriage of Louisa Watling, widow, and William Smith, widower, by a JP on March 17, 1848.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Under one scenario,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Jubal would have died some time between 1841 and 1848 and, presumably is buried in PEI. Records show the likely cemeteries for Lot 52 to be either the Lorne Valley Presbyterian or the Montague Community cemeteries; a search of tombstone inscriptions does not reveal any Watlings.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>My conclusion, not fully substantiated, is that, after Susannah died, Jubal and the family came to Canada; Louisa may have come at the same time and may have been the paying passenger; sometime later they married and continued to live in PEI; several of the children, however, moved to the Miramichi area of New Brunswick seeking employment in the shipbuilding industry; Jubal died, presumably, in the early 1840's and is buried in PEI; Louisa remarried William Smith in 1848.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>NOTE: </b><b><i>Again, this is my conclusion but one that cannot be fully substantiated.</i></b><b><i></i></b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Musings</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I am struck by:</p>
<p>The death of their three infant children</p>
<p>The fact that children were given the same names as those who died.</p>
<p>How active the Watling group is and the amount of information they have about Watlings everywhere.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>My exploration on the Watling side is now focused on:</p>
<p>The marriage date and family information for Emily and William Maxwell.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>(my notes suggest they had no children</p>
<p>Death and burial records for Jubal in PEI</p>
<p>Death and burial information for John and Jessie (Carruthers) Watling who lived in Napan before moving to the USA</p>
<p>Whether Jubal and Louisa had children</p>
<p>Further information about George and his family</p>
<p>The parents of Jubal and Susanna</p>
<p><b><i></i></b><br></p>
<p><b>Correction</b><b></b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Chronicle 148 should list Jimmie Reinsborough and his widowed sister, Bridget O’Kane, following the MacKay household, #70.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Although Jack Wilson had provided me with the name, somehow, it got left out when entering it in the chronicle.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Sorry.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Miramichi Rural</b><b></b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>While sorting papers I came across a 14 page document by Mr. Patstone, the first Principal of the Miramichi Rural High School.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Patstone tells about events leading up to the establishment of the school.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I’ve scanned it and would be happy to send an electronic copy if you send me an Email address.</p>
