	<p align="justify" style="orphans: 2; widows: 2"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify" style="orphans: 2; widows: 2">My
	Great-grandfather, John Glendinning was born at Callister Hall,
	Dumfriesshire, Scotland on April 2, 1807.  Callister Hall still
	stands, although it was believed to have suffered severe fire damage
	in earlier years.  At one time it was said to have served as a
	stage-coach stop and Inn.  The photo of me in front of Callister
	Hall was taken in 1988.</p>
	<p align="justify" style="orphans: 2; widows: 2"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify" style="orphans: 2; widows: 2">Callister
	Hall was shown on maps of Scotland but not any longer.  It is not in
	a village; it is a building on the side, if a narrow paved country
	road, out in sheep country.  This also supports the family belief
	that our Grandmother had a shuttle supposedly brought from Scotland.
	 It is not very far from Lockerbie where the major plane crash
	occurred a few years ago.  Annan was the seaport from which John
	Glendinning sailed.  As I recall, Annan and Callister Hall would be
	30 to 40 miles apart.</p>

	<p align="justify" style="orphans: 2; widows: 2"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify" style="orphans: 2; widows: 2">Thanks
	to Willis Hamilton of Saint John, some new information has come to
	light on the Harley family.  Five Harley children came to New
	Brunswick in the 1820's.  Margaret (1803-1895) who married John
	Glendinning, Mary Ann (1799-1898) who married John Henry from
	Newcastle, Elizabeth (1796-1876) who married William Knowles, John
	who was a boat builder on the Miramichi and William who was a
	surveyor.  William moved to Fredericton where he married, he later
	moved to Upper Canada.

	father, who was English, taught school in Courtmasherry, County
	Cork, Ireland where all the children were born.</p>
	<p align="justify" style="orphans: 2; widows: 2"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify" style="orphans: 2; widows: 2">John
	Henry died in 1870 and Mary Ann moved to Portland, Maine where some
	of her children were living (she had nine).  Her 99<sup>th</sup>
	birthday party was reported in a Portland newspaper.  According to
	the new item, Mary Ann, while living in Ireland, received a letter

	waiting@ for her.  The ship and its 150 passengers sailed on May 7,
	1822 and the crossing took seven weeks and three days; Mary Ann was
	sick most of the way.  The ship and its passengers landed at
	APockshaw@ (Pokeshaw) where she was met by her brother.  They walked
	through A a trackless forest@ to Newcastle, a distance of 85 miles,
	Mary Ann reported that there was not path, no conveyance, not a tree
	had been cut; using a compass, they made their way across windfalls
	and over brooks arriving in Newcastle on the fourth night.  Eight
	months later, she married John Henry.</p>

	</p>
	<p align="justify" style="orphans: 2; widows: 2"><b>Watling</b></p>
	<p align="justify" style="orphans: 2; widows: 2"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify" style="orphans: 2; widows: 2">Watling
	is a rare name so, when I saw reference to it at a genealogy shop
	last winger I stopped to take a look.  I also bought one of those
	family name scrolls. I=ve summarized it below.</p>
	<p align="justify" style="orphans: 2; widows: 2"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">Watling
	is likely originally a Viking name which came first to Norther
	Scotland, then to France and finally to England.  The first record
	of the name was found in Sussex and would be somewhere between
	London and Dover.  They were Lords of the Manor and may well have
	been there from the time of William the Conqueror (1066).  While the
	origin is not known precisely, it is likely either that they came
	from the village of Wartlington or were in some way, connected with
	the great Roman Road, Watling Street, which starts in Sussex and
	continues into Northern England.</p>
	<p align="justify" style="orphans: 2; widows: 2"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify" style="orphans: 2; widows: 2">Watling
	is thought to share the same roots as Whatling, Watlington,
	Watlingtone, Whatlington, Whatlingtone, Wadling and Wadlington. 
	Over time, the name spread northward through England and into
	Scotland.</p>
	<p align="justify" style="orphans: 2; widows: 2"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify" style="orphans: 2; widows: 2">Thomas
	Watling was banished to Australia for forgery in 1792; Francis
	Watling settled in Virginia in 1660, John Watling landed in America
	in 1753 and Mary Watlington settled in Antigua in 1759.</p>
	<p align="justify" style="orphans: 2; widows: 2"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify" style="orphans: 2; widows: 2"><b>Jardine</b></p>
	<p align="justify" style="orphans: 2; widows: 2"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify" style="orphans: 2; widows: 2">In
	an earlier issue, I referred to some information in the Jardine
	family history which is at odds with what I have.  Thanks to
	information from a number of people, I am convinced that our
	Great-grandmother was Elspeth Jardine and not Elizabeth Jardine as
	reported in the Jardine history.</p>
	<p align="justify" style="orphans: 2; widows: 2"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify" style="orphans: 2; widows: 2"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify" style="orphans: 2; widows: 2"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify" style="orphans: 2; widows: 2">As
	far as I can figure out, our Great-grandmother, Elspeth Jardine who
	married John MacDonald, was the daughter of James Jardine (son of
	Joseph and Janet (Kerr) Jardine of Tundergarth, Dumfriesshire,
	Scotland). Great-grandmother=s brothers and sisters included
	Margaret who married Thomas Lockerbie, Joseph who married Barbara
	Rust, Janet who married Francis McKnight, George who married Mary
	Cameron, and James.</p>
	<p align="justify" style="orphans: 2; widows: 2"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">The
	Jane Elizabeth Jardine, after whom my mother was named, was a first
	cousin of my Great-grandmother.  Her father was John, a brother of
	Frank.</p>
