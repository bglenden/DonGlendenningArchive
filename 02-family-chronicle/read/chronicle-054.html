</p>
	<p align="center"><b>Elinor
	taken in 1940</b></p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>Elinor,
	her Dad called her Nen, was born in Canada and attended the Little
	Branch School to the end of Grade 8.  She then wrote High School
	Entrance exams and attended high school classes were started in the
	Bay du Vin church.   
	</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>She
	usually walked to Bay du Vin, a distance of 5 miles, but sometimes
	rode a bicycle.  In the winter she boarded at Barbour Williston’s.
	 On a beautiful sunny day in early September, 1935, I walked with
	Elinor to my first day at school.   
	</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>By
	1933, Grace, Venetia and Lillian had left home and Elinor would have
	been the only daughter at home to help Mum. With Dad and five boys
	at home, while still going to school, and without electricity or
	running water, the work would have been heavy, indeed.</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>Elinor
	met Earl Alexander Taylor  (May 10, 1916 – December 23, 1969) when
	he worked and stayed at home.  They were married at the Presbyterian
	Manse in Chatham on February 17, 1940 and had seven children, Gerald
	Ernest, Robert Earl, Sandra Jean, David Walter, Virginia Elinor,
	Francis Elmer and Kenneth Eldon Doring.  They lived at the Branch
	until, I think, Earl went in the army then they bought a house on
	Harriman Lane in Loggieville.  As best I can remember, Elinor stayed
	in Loggieville all the time Earl was in the service.</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>Earl
	was discharged from the army on February 15, 1946 and worked at the
	Chatham air base.  They continued to live in Loggieville.  
	</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>In
	the summer of 1949, Elinor and Earl and family moved to Black River.
	 Alex MacDonald had been killed in an accident and W. S. Loggie
	Company held the mortgage on his property.  Elinor turned over their
	house in Loggieville to Loggie's and paid the difference - $300.  I
	moved their belongings from Loggieville to Black River in the 1949
	red Chev ½ ton truck.  On one trip, we stopped to see Norm who was
	cutting grain in the field below John’s house.</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>Elinor
	was active in St. Paul’s Presbyterian Church being a member of
	both the Women’s League and the Presbyterian Missionary Society, a
	member of the Women’s Institute and an active Member of the Black
	River Community Hall Committee.  The hall had burned and a new
	building was constructed.  (This was the second time that the Black
	River Hall had burned.).  She phoned me to tell me about the fire; a
	few days later she went into the hospital and died after a brief
	illness.</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>Once
	when having supper after a day digging potatoes, we were sitting at
	the dining room table.  Uncle Jim was there because it was the
	custom for neighbours to exchange labour while cutting wood,
	threshing, picking potatoes etc.  It was dark so there was an oil
	lamp on the table.  Elinor went to reach across for butter and poked
	her knife through the lamp globe.  Of course, the flame went out as
	a result of the air rushing in.</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>Elinor
	wrote regularly when I was in England and her letters were always
	newsy.  At Christmas of 1955 – my first Christmas away from home,
	I recall coming back to the residence late on Christmas day to find
	a letter waiting for me from Elinor.  (Only in England would mail be
	delivered on Christmas day.)</p>

	<p align="center" style="page-break-after: avoid"><b>Elinor
	- Undated</b></p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>Elinor
	was a “high-energy” person – some may say it was a nervous
	energy.  She was a good worker, had a quick turn of mind, was
	fiercely loyal, and quick to support or defend family members.  She
	also had a temper.  Once when she was young, Mum sent the youngsters
	upstairs to make their Valentines.  (Ken says that Jamie Mortimer
	and Ward Godfrey were at home at the time).  Elinor and Norm had a
	spat and Norm tried to take the scissors from her and cut his hand. 
	Elinor enjoyed hockey and was a fan of the Montreal Canadiens.  She
	was a good letter writer and wrote to her son, Robert, every day but
	two during the years he lived in Toronto.  I forget the reason for
	the first day she did not write but the second was the day she was
	admitted to the hospital just before she died.</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>As
	her family got older, Elinor did housework for a number of people in
	Chatham and at CFB Chatham.  She also worked at the Miramichi
	Seniors’ Home in Chatham and at the Rehabilitation Centre.</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>On
	one of our visits from Ottawa to New Brunswick, Elinor and Kenneth
	returned with us and stayed a week or two.  We had a tent trailer at
	the time and I remember camping near Grand Falls on the return trip.
	 She also visited us in Charlottetown.</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>Earl
	had purchased a beautiful cream, chrome and red bicycle – double
	bars, handle bars and all.  It was a far cry from the old bicycle
	which Walter had as a kid and which we, and half Black River,
	learned to ride on. Sometimes <br />
Earl would take me on the parcel
	carrier; sometimes he even let me take it by myself.  One evening,
	just at dusk, he took me across to the field just behind Uncle Jim’s
	shed where Uncle Jim was burning piles of brush.</p>
	<p><br />

	following tribute was written by Mrs. Donald Angus MacDonald.</p>
