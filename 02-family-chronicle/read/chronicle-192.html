<p>	<b>The Family</b> <b>Chronicle</b><b></b></p>
<p>No. 192 <span>_______________________________________________________________</span></p>
<p><span></span><span> </span><b>Church Union</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I’ve avoided mentioning church union of 1925; however, it was a significant event and one that strained relationships in Black River for many years.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I’ve decided to avoid it no longer.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Tensions were evident when I was young, and may well exist among some of the older generation even today.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The decision even split some families</p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>Here is my understanding based on my personal knowledge and experience, a master’s thesis by John Cameron about church union in Pictou, Nova Scotia, and a book in 1985, <span>Resistance to Church Union</span><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>by Clifford Keith.</p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>Divisions within the Presbyterian Church in Scotland, it seems, went on forever.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Most resulted from differing views as to the proper or acceptable relationship between church and state.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Scots were not prepared to accept a state church, as was the case in England.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Perhaps another cause for dissension was the strong view that no minister or church hierarchy should stand between a person and his/her God. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Then there was the issue of churches being able to appoint their own minister rather than have a minister appointed by the land owner or proprietor, or some other church body.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>By 1843 there were four different Presbyterian churches in Scotland – and Scots brought their differing views with them when they came to Canada.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The early mid -1800’s witnessed a movement towards unification among a number of Presbyterian denominations that resulted, by 1875, in the creation of the Presbyterian Church in Canada - and discussions with other Presbyterians continued.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Other denominations were coming together as well.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Union within the Methodist denomination was achieved by 1884 and within the Congregationalist churches by 1906.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The Church of England, as early as 1836, had appointed a committee to explore possible union with like-minded denominations.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Talk of further unification, therefore, was not unexpected.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In fact, at the inception of the Presbyterian Church in Canada, Dr. John Cook, the Moderator, said, “Far larger union is in store”.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Others expressed similar sentiments.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A federation of denominations was also considered an option.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>While discussions were going on, a number of churches cooperated in the Sunday School Association of Canada, Temperance Movement and the Evangelical Alliance.; this helped to break down denominational barriers. There was even a sharing of social services between congregations, cooperation in the training of clergy and a wider discussion of matters theological. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>In the late 1800’s, multi-party discussions were held within the Presbyterian family and among Presbyterians, Methodists, Congregationalists and the Church of England with a view to bringing all together into a single Protestant denomination.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It appears to have been clergy led and clumsily executed. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>By 1904 discussions were well under way towards an organic union among Protestant denominations led by a joint committee representing the Presbyterians, Methodist and Congregational denominations. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The report to the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church concluded that the process should not be unduly hurried, should carry the consent of the entire membership and should not be contemplated until all the courts of the church had a chance to consider it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Consent of the entire membership” and concerns about an unclear doctrinal statement for the new church appear to be the major points of dissention over the next two decades.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In 1906 invitations to participate in discussions were issued to the Church of England and Baptist conventions but these invitations were declined.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>By 1912, those against union had begun to coalesce and organize.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>While votes at Presbytery, Synod and General Assembly levels continued to favour union; numbers against union at the congregational level continued to grow.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Support for union was strongest among clergy, and leadership moved to the courts of the church rather than remaining with members and adherents.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The main points of contention seemed to centre on:</p>
<p>the disappearance of the name Presbyterian. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>doctrinal changes</p>
<p>level of support required to warrant such a momentous change, and</p>
<p>perception that union was the first step towards a “state<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>church”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Decisions on church union were taken by each congregation.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Tabulated nationally, the 1925 voting results were:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Votes cast in favour	121,547</p>
<p>Votes against		114,175	Total Votes		<span>235,722</span></p>
<p>	</p>
<p>Members not voting	144,040</p>
<p>	Total eligible voters	<span>379,762</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>In the Maritime Synod, 18,883 voted in favour of union and 13,743 voted against.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Of the 4,981 members of the Miramichi Presbytery in 1925, 2,011 voted in favour of union and 647 voted against union with 2.323 not voting.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Figures for St. Stephens Church are not available, however, the majority favoured union and St. Stephens Presbyterian Church became St. Stephens United Church.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Those wishing to continue in the Presbyterian Church regrouped and erected a new sanctuary, St. Paul’s Presbyterian Church.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Cemetery</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Perhaps the single most contentious issue in Black River was that of the cemetery.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As background:</p>
<p>the first person buried there was Robert MacBeath in 1923;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>the land where MacBeath was buried was purchased by St. Stephen’s Presbyterian Church in 1836 at the time the first church was built and was named St. Stephen’s Presbyterian Cemetery;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>apparently, immediately following church union, the Presbyterians considered establishing their own cemetery;</p>
<p>in 1940, however, the congregation of St. Stephens United Church passed a resolution granting Presbyterians the “same rights and privileges as to the use of the cemetery as they had before church union.” <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Presbyterians accepted the offer and decided that a separate Presbyterian cemetery was not needed.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>From 1940 onward, some obituaries referred to the cemetery as St. Stephens while others referred to it as the Black River Cemetery.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Today, it seems, more and more people refer to it as the Black River Community Cemetery.</p>
