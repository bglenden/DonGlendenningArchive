<div class="reader-summary">Nostalgic survey of reading materials accessible during Don&#x27;s childhood: mother&#x27;s book exchange system; Bible and Presbyterian publications (Record, Message, Young People&#x27;s meeting materials); Family Herald and Weekly Star (farming-oriented weekly with ads/cartoons); Chatham Gazette (local/war news); Junior Red Cross materials; peddler-sold goods and newspapers; Eaton&#x27;s/Simpson&#x27;s catalogues; school library limitations. Specific titles: Chums (large illustrated boys&#x27; magazine), &quot;Big Little Books&quot; (flip-animation format), Boy Scout books and airplane spotter guides. Reflects literacy culture of rural Maritimes and Don&#x27;s formative intellectual exposure. Includes vivid memory of summertime sleeping outdoors under apple tree.</div>

	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><b>Reading
	material</b></p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">We
	always seemed to have reading material available.</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Mother
	liked to read and I can recall Mother heading out to the Ladies
	League, WMS or the WI with a book under her arm to exchange with
	Mrs. Harper or another in the community.  Occasionally she would buy
	a book, always a used one, and it too circulated.  I cannot ever
	remember my Mother buying a new novel or a periodical.</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">The
	Bible was a prized book along with the Presbyterian Record and the
	Presbyterian Message which was the voice of the Presbyterian
	Missionary Society.  The “Messages” were kept in a little
	chest/trunk upstairs in the “little room”, the one that the
	kitchen stove pipe ran through.  Messages were great sources of
	items when we were required to have a reading at our Young People’s
	meetings – which was practically every meeting.</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">We
	subscribed to the <u>Family
	Herald and Weekly Star</u>
	which arrived every Wednesday in the mail.  It was printed in
	Ontario.  It was oriented to the farming sector but also included
	world and Canadian news.  Several pages at the back of the paper
	were filled with advertising.  It also had cartoons, jokes and the
	“funnies”.  I remember looking through the advertisements and
	from them made contact with a company near Toronto, Warco Grease and
	Oil, from which I purchased grease, oil, paint, etc and sold it
	around Black River.  This was a source of my spending money.</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">The
	<u>Chatham Gazette</u>
	was published, as I recall, twice a week and came in the mail.   The
	Gazette carried local news as well as Canadian and world news
	especially news arising from WW2.  The Gazette also carried
	obituaries but they only confirmed what everyone already knew.  A
	little later in my life, the Gazette became the source o information
	as to where dances were being held.</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Junior
	Red Cross papers were distributed to students through the school.  
	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Peddlers
	traveled the countryside by horse selling odds and ends such as
	needles, thread, combs and trinkets from door to door.  The wagon
	had a small box, perhaps the size of a trunk, built on the back to
	carry their wares.  They did not come into the yard but one went to
	the end of the lane and stopped the peddler if you wanted something.
	The only one I recall was Abe Asouf with his slow-moving horse. 
	Sometimes a peddler stayed over night and I recall one peddler left
	behind a newspaper in, as I recall, Arabic.  That was a real item of
	curiosity.</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Strange
	as it may sound, Eaton’s and Simpson’s catalogues were also a
	source of reading material.</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">The
	library in the Little Branch School consisted of one bookcase about
	three feet wide and four feet high.  I cannot ever remember taking
	books from it to read.  Neither can I remember a library in the
	Miramichi Rural High School but there may have been one.  I cannot
	recall the first library I encountered but it was likely at
	Teachers’ College in Fredericton when I was seventeen.</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><u>Chums</u>
	was a boy’s book.  It was large, as I recall, 11 by 17 inches, and
	twice as thick as Eaton’s catalogue.  Kennie MacDonald had copies,
	received as Christmas gifts by his Aunts, and I remember borrowing a
	couple.</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">For
	a while we had “Big Little Books”.  They were small books,
	perhaps 3 inches by four inches by one and a quarter inches thick. 
	The neat thing about these were the small photos in the upper right
	hand corner of each page.  If one used one’s thumb to flip the
	pages, the action figures in the small photos seemed to move.</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">I
	must have had comic books but cannot remember buying them.</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Recently
	when sorting some things in the basement, I came across some of my
	early books.  One was a Boy Scout book given to me one Christmas by
	Betty Ann Walker, the daughter of a family Lillian worked for in
	Boston. (The family also sent me a Lionel wind-up train one
	Christmas.)  
	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">I
	also found “an airplane spotters guide” which showed the
	silhouettes of planes, and gave their specifications and marking. 
	It probably was an English book and would be useful there for
	spotting both friendly and enemy aircraft – we did not have many
	enemy aircraft flying over the Miramichi.  I also have a booklet
	with coloured photos of ships.</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><b>Hazy,
	Lazy Days of Summer</b></p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">We’ve
	had a very warm summer so far with many humid days.  Occasionally we
	would have such days in the Miramichi but, for the most part,
	evenings were cool and bedrooms cooled off for sleeping.  There were
	occasions, however, when we would put a blanket on the ground in the
	front yard, under the old apple tree, and spend the early part of
	the night outside or perhaps even sleep outside all night.</p>
