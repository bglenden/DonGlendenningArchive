<p><b>Guy Wellington Glendenning</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>The Herald Advocate, Wauchula, Florida of February 24 1967 reported the following:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b><i>Guy W. Glendenning</i></b></p>
<p><i>Guy W. Glendenning, 77, Died February 8 after an extended illness.</i></p>
<p><i>He was born in Canobie, New Brunswick, Canada and was a Canadian Veteran of World War l.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He came to Bowling Green in 1930 from Peru where he was affiliated with the Masonic Lodge in 1921, serving as Worshipful Master a few years later.</i></p>
<p><i>He was Past Master of Bowling Green Lodge 121 and Past Patron of Bowling Green Chapter 23, Order of the Eastern Star, a Scottish Rite Mason, and a member of the Wauchula Elks Lodge.</i></p>
<p><i>Survivors are his widow, Hazel Stultz Glendenning; a son Robert Glendenning of Chesterton, Md.; a daughter, Cornelia Farrell, Huntington Station, Long Island, N. Y; one brother, Ray Glendenning of Canobie, New Brunswick, Canada and four grandchildren.</i></p>
<p><i>Funeral services were held February 13 at the Bowling Green Methodist Church with the Rev. E. J. Halter officiating.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Burial was in the Bowling Green Cemetery."</i></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Hazel (Stultz) Glendenning</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The Herald Advocate, Wauchula, Florida (1979 - I forgot to record date) reported the following:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b><i>Hazel (Stultz) Glendenning</i></b></p>
<p><i></i><br></p>
<p><i>"Hazel Glendenning, 85, a resident of Huntington, N.Y. and former resident of Bowling Green for 46 years passed away Wednesday, July 4 in New York.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She was born in Brooklyn, N.Y.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She was a member of O.E.S.</i></p>
<p><i>She is survived by one daughter, Cornelia Traetta of Huntington, N.Y; one son, Robert W. Glendenning of Chesterton, Md., and four grandchildren.</i></p>
<p><i>Graveside services were held Saturday, July 7, with interment in Bowling Green Cemetery.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Rev. John Springer officiated."</i></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Watling Island</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>While on a cruise in the Caribbean earlier this year, the Captain announced that we had passed Watling’s Island during the previous night.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As I reported earlier, I thought the name had been changed to San Salvador Island.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Watling’s Island was named after Captain George Watling who was known as the “pious pirate because he would not let his crew play cards or indulge in piracy on the Sabbath.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>According to one source, there was, and maybe still is, a Watling Castle located at Sandy Point on the Island</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Slot Machines Company</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>Was browsing the internet yesterday and discovered that, from the late 1890’s to the mid 1950’s there was a Watling company that made slot machines in Maine.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>History</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Lillian (Glendenning) Murray gave me some papers from her mother.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Included was a clipping from the Northumberland News dated June 3, 1981 entitled <b>History of Black River – Part ll.</b><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The article quoted a History of Black River that appeared in the Chatham Gleaner on June 25, 1833.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Does anyone have Part One?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If <i>could</i> find the complete article, I would include it in a future Family Chronicle</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Helena (Smith) Kingston</b></p>
