	<p><b>Yankee
	Toast</b></p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>My sister,
	Lillian, recalled how much she enjoyed Mum’s Yankee Toast.  I
	vaguely recall it and others in the family recalled it but not how
	it was made.  
	</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>A search
	of the internet reveals a number of recipes but they were a version
	of French Toast – usually with cinnamon.</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>An enquiry
	to Margaret Prouse, a regular contributor on food to the
	Charlottetown Guardian, brought the following information.</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>“<i>Yankee
	toast was served as a treat at either breakfast or supper.  It was
	prepared by combining a </i>
	</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p><i>bit of
	pork fat, a good tablespoon of molasses, and about the same amount
	of water in a cast iron frying pan.  A slice of bread was dipped in
	the mixture in the frying pan, and then quickly turned over so that
	both sides were coated.  One side was fried until the molasses
	caramelized and then the process was repeated to the other side. 
	Butter could be used instead of pork fat.  </i>
	</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p><i>Another
	approach is to take a thick slice of bread and butter both sides. 
	Heat molasses until it bubbles.  Allow bread to cook briefly than
	turn over and repeat.  Home made bread is best and preferably a day
	or two old;  “store bought” bread tends to get soggy.”</i></p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<h5>Point Aux
	Quart</h5>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>According
	to the History of Bay du Vin, years ago English ships were chasing
	French ships in Bay du Vin; the French ships were loaded with wine. 
	To prevent capture, the French threw their casks of wine overboard. 
	The casks floated to Point aux Carr, which is the French word for
	cask.  
	</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<h5>Humphrey
	Pants</h5>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>Humphrey
	pants were prized.  The name came from the company that made them –
	or at least, made the cloth.  Humphrey’s Mill was on the outskirts
	of Moncton.  I remember the old red brick buildings when I was a
	student in Moncton; they were not far from where Ken and Verne once
	lived.  The building may even be still standing.  Humphrey cloth was
	made of wool and as I recall, mottled dark greenish in colour.  It
	was finely woven and, therefore, both warm and relatively
	waterproof.  There was imitation cloth but the Humphrey label had
	prestige as well as durability; it was also expensive.  It was
	standard in my family but only once did I manage to warrant a pair
	of Humphrey pants.</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>In talking
	about Humphrey pants at the recent family reunion, Norm recalled
	someone saying, I forget who, “with Humphrey pants, no matter how
	cold and wet you were, you were always warm and dry.”</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<h5></h5>
	<h5></h5>
	<h5>Glendenning
	Fund</h5>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>Thanks to
	the following for recent contributions to the Fund:  Ray and Jeannie
	Williston, Alton Glendenning, Eileen Glendenning, Jarret Glendenning
	and Kelli Morton</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>I was
	asked recently about the purpose of the Glendenning Fund and why one
	should contribute.  Let me say two things first.  The money from the
	Fund is not for the use of the Glendenning family; grants may be
	made for any charitable purpose in the community of Black River. 
	Contributions are voluntary, income tax receiptable in both Canada
	and the USA.  Just now, we are building the fund and soliciting
	contributions.  Even after it is established, contributions can be
	made at any time.  For instance, a contribution can be made in
	memory of a deceased, or on someone’s birthday or other special
	occasion.  Provisions can also be made in a will.</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>In my
	volunteer work with the Foundation, I find that people give because
	they want to:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><p>give
		something back to their community</p></li>
		<li><p>support
		a worthy cause</p></li>
		<li><p>remember
		a family member or friend</p></li>
		<li><p>honour
		an achievement or an event in a persons life</p></li>
		<li><p>support
		a charitable cause of special interest.</p></li>
	</ul>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>Speaking
	personally, I am proud of the Glendenning name and the contributions
	of my parents and siblings to their communities.  Growing up in
	Black River made a significant contribution to who and what I am. 
	Although I no longer live there, contributing to the Fund is a way I
	can give something back.

	<h5>Lillian had this to say…</h5>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>Lillian
	had this to say about Mum’s cooking 
	</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>“<i>Mum was the best
	cook ever.  Having a big family to feed, bread to make almost every
	day, and in those days, a bread had to be set overnight, starting
	with a batter called sponge, in which the yeast was mixed into about
	a quart of flour and let rise.  Quick yeast wasn’t used until the
	war years in the forty’s.  That sure was an improvement, so much
	less time to make bread.  Many times Mum would cook hot biscuits and
	applesauce for breakfast along with porriage, fried potatoes, lots
	of fresh cream.  Mum’s specials were Yankee toast (bread fried in
	molasses) scallop </i>
	</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p><i>potatoes, apple pie
	baked in a square pan and cream on top.  Do you remember when she
	would bake cinnamon rolls and put a sauce over it before they were
	put in the oven to bake,  How we all loved that for dessert.   Then
	there were cooked cranberries with thick cream on them and hot
	biscuits to eat with it”.  </i>
	</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>Edith
	MacKenzie once said ‘give Aunt Jane something to cook with and no
	one can beat her for putting up a good meal in a hurry’.  …
	(Dad) told her at noon that there would possibly be twelve or
	fifteen men in for supper”</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>A recent
	note from Shirley MacKay mentioned how good Mum’s meals were.</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<h5>Saw Mills</h5>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>I do not
	know when the first saw mill was constructed at Little Branch,
	however, the History of Bay du Vin records a sawmill operated by
	Ortho Robichaud in 1789 in the Bay du Vin area.</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>The Bay du
	Vin history also reports the following taken from the Gleaner in
	1833.</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>“<i>Mr. George Fowlie
	erected a grist mill on the Little Black River, which commenced
	grinding last week.  We have seen some bread made of the flour
	manufactured at this mill and it was of superior quality.  It has a
	never failing stream of water and will be a great accommodation to
	the inhabitants of Bay du Vin and adjoining settlements where such
	an establishment was much wanted.”  The Fowlie mill was burned and
	rebuilt twice. “</i></p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<h5>Walls Brook</h5>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>The 1913
	and 1915 reports of St. Stephen’s Church refer to Walls’ Brook. 
	I always knew it as “Wells’es” Brook.
