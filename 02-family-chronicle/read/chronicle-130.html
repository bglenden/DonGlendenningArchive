	The
	A&amp;R Loggie Co. was incorporated in 1881 at Black Brook, later
	renamed Loggieville.  As I recall, Aunt Tine said that Andrew
	Loggie, the oldest had started by peddling goods from door to door.

	They
	were exporters of salmon, smelts, trout, haddock, etc and also
	packaged (frozen and canned) Eagle Brand, Old Oaken Bucket and Sea
	Gull. Their  sawmill, producing rough and finished lumber , shingles
	and laths, was a large operation and took up all of the space on the
	waterfront across from their general store.   The store had a
	central cashier; clerks at the counter made up the bill, stuffed the
	bill and your money into a little hollow container, the container
	was whisked across the store to the  cashier who checked the bill,
	made change and returned the bill and change to the clerk.

	</p>
	<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
	In
	Loggieville alone, the company employed about 150 workers.  Part of
	a worker’s pay packet was a credit that had to be used at their
	store.

	<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
	In
	the summer, Loggie’s bought, cleaned, froze and shipped
	blueberries. Once when travelling with Brydone to Bathurst, he drove
	in to a blueberry barren along the highway to show where the picking
	took place.  Both A &amp; R Loggies and W S Loggie”s delivered

	groceries,
	flour and feed throughout the neighbouring communities.  Mother
	would phone her list and the next day the truck would deliver her
	groceries to the door.  As I recall, the came twice a week to our
	area and delivered as far east as Escuminac.</p>

	<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
	The
	sawmill was completely destroyed by fire on august 4, 1944.  I
	recall being wakened by a commotion to find a glow in the sky to the
	west of our place.  John, Ken and probably Norm were getting ready
	to drive to Loggieville to see the fire and they took me along.  The
	boys may have even spotted the fire on the way home from a dance and
	decided to change clothes before driving out.</p>

	The
	company was founded by Andrew and Robert Loggie; Frank Loggie joined
	later.  By 1940, all three were dead.  Shortly after the fire the
	company was sold</p>

	The
