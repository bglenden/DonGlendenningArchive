</p>
	<p align="justify">Undated
	photo of the Miramichi Rural High School.  The school has since been
	demolished.</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">MRHS</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">The
	Miramichi Rural High School was the first of a new series of rural
	high schools in New Brunswick; the second school was on Deer Island.
	 Before that, high school classes were offered (for two or three
	years) in the Bay du Vin Rectory by Rev. Smith.  Students from Black
	River walked or biked to Bay du Vin in good weather and traveled by
	horse and sled in the winter.  Even after MRHS opened, I remember
	Norman taking a horse and sled to Bay Side picking up fellow
	students along the way and leaving the horse across the road from
	the school during the day in Harrison Smith’s barn.  Of course,
	one always carried some hay and oats for the horse while it was
	stabled.</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">The
	school was built, as I recall for $13,000 and opened in January
	1940.  My first visit to MRHS was late in the fall of 1939 when
	George Watling and biked down to see it.  It was an impressive
	building for a rural area.  As the photo above shows, it was two
	story with two classrooms on each level at the front and an
	auditorium on the second floor at the back.  At the back on the
	lower floor were the principal’s office, boys and girls washrooms
	and the furnace room.</p>
	<p align="justify">MRHS
	had electric lights, 32 volt as I recall,  operated from a bank of
	glass-encased batteries and had a small gasoline engine which
	switched on automatically to charge the batteries. It also had a
	coal-fired furnace.  A very tall flagpole stood in the front yard by
	the driveway.  It looked like a ship’s mast.  The pole, not the
	flag on the pole, had to be raised and lowered using a team of
	horses.  
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">Initially,
	MRHS drew its students from the following six one-room schools:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><p align="justify">Little
		Branch, 
		</p></li>
		<li><p align="justify">Victoria,
		
		</p></li>
		<li><p align="justify">Cameron
		(Middle Black River)</p></li>
		<li><p align="justify">Miramichi
		(Bayside)</p></li>
		<li><p align="justify">Auburnville</p></li>
		<li><p align="justify">Bay
		du Vin</p></li>
	</ul>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">Other
	districts were added later.</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">I
	believe that I started at MRHS in 1941 and graduated in 1946.  There
	were about 30 of us in Grade 7 but only 11 or 12 graduated.</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">While
	visiting Bill Gregan recently, I was reminded about some of the
	shenanigans (by other students, obviously) while we were at MRHS.   
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li><p align="justify">Ken,
		Norm and I were at the MRHS at the same time.  One teacher, perhaps
		Miss Hetherington, had both Norm and I in her classes.  She called
		Norm “Big Glendenning” and called me “Little Glendenning”. 
		
		</p></li>
	</ul>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<ul>
		<li><p align="justify">One
		trick was to place a paper cup full of water on the top edge of a
		classroom door.  When the door was opened, the cup of water came
		tumbling down, hopefully on someone’s head.  
		</p></li>
	</ul>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<ul>
		<li><p align="justify">The
		boy’s toilet was constructed in such a way that there was a beam
		across the top of the entry to the section where the stalls were. 
		It was a great place to practice “chinning”. 
		</p></li>
	</ul>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<ul>
		<li><p align="justify">There
		a large covered bin in the boy’s washroom was used to store
		potatoes from the school garden</p></li>
	</ul>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<ul>
		<li><p align="justify">Perley
		Quayle was a fine man and a good teacher but also a person who
		understood student pranks.  He had a Model A Coupe which he parked
		at the east end of the school.  We frequently moved it or turned it
		around.  
		</p></li>
	</ul>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<ul>
		<li><p align="justify">One
		morning I missed the bus at the Little Branch corner and had to
		walk to school – about 3 miles.  Of course, I was late.  When I
		stepped into the school, I met Mr. Quayle.  I explained what had
		happened and then quipped “Better late than never” to which he
		responded ‘Yes, but better never late.”</p></li>
	</ul>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<ul>
		<li><p align="justify">Lowell
		Williston had a wooden leg.  In the fall of 1939, there was an
		outbreak of scarlet fever.  The school health officer was a Dr.
		Loggie. When checking to see if people had a rash, one sign of
		scarlet fever, he would look at their backs, arms or legs.  He
		asked Lowell to pull up his pant leg; Dr. Loggie looked at his leg
		and pronounced him free of scarlet fever.  Lowell had a wooden leg.</p></li>
	</ul>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">In
	the early years, students were expected to plant school gardens.  It
	seems to me that we were paired and each pair had a small plot. 
	Come fall, the vegetables were canned and kept in the closet under
	the stairs.  I know that some of the boys would sneak into the
	closet before noon, open a can of beans or whatever, place them
	inside the sheet metal on top of the furnace to warm and then enjoy
	them with their lunch.</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">Perley
	Quayle brought some of his own equipment to the school for our use. 
	One item was a huge lathe for wood turning.  It was operated like a
	treadle sewing machine.  He also set up a blacksmithing area in the
	coal bin and we learned to work – shaping, welding, annealing,
	tempering, etc. 
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">High
	school students now travel to Chatham and new Miramichi Rural School
	caters to about 80 students in K-8.
