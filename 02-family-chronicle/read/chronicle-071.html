	<p align="justify"><b>Building
	a Load of Hay</b></p>
	<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
	<p align="justify">There
	was quite an art to building a load of loose hay – and remember,
	the load was being build on a rack on a truck wagon.  For those not
	familiar with a truck wagon, it was a heavy farm wagon with high
	wheels.  The hayrack sat about three feet off the ground which meant
	that you had to pitch the hay a minimum of four feet before putting
	it on the rack and another 6-8 feet when it was loaded.  The rack
	had a bit of a well because the sides were built up to clear the
	wagon wheels.</p>
	<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
	<p align="justify" style="widows: 2; font-weight: normal; orphans: 2">
	The hay would be forked onto the
	wagon.  The first forkfuls were tramped well in the centre of the
	rack.  Then forkfuls of hay were placed around the perimeter.  The
	key was to keep placing lots of hay along the outside and then
	binding it by adding hay to the middle.  The sides of a load of hay
	were kept higher than the middle.  Otherwise, the hay on the sides
	would just keep slipping off.  
	</p>
	<p align="justify" style="widows: 2; font-weight: normal; orphans: 2">
	&nbsp;</p>
	<p align="justify" style="widows: 2; font-weight: normal; orphans: 2">
	A well-built load of hay would
	be about 7 feet high above the rack with the sides kept straight. 
	It was important to have a solid load because many times it would be
	taken across a rough field and then a mile or two by road before
	reaching home.</p>
	<p align="justify" style="widows: 2; font-weight: normal; orphans: 2">
	&nbsp;</p>
	<p align="justify" style="widows: 2; font-weight: normal; orphans: 2">
	Once home, a load of hay would
	be driven into the barn and, if at night, the horses unhitched,
	taken out through a back door and stabled for the night.  Otherwise,
	the horses would remain hitched to the wagon while the hay was
	unloaded.  It was harder to stick the fork into a load that was left
	over night.</p>
	<p align="justify" style="widows: 2; font-weight: normal; orphans: 2">
	&nbsp;</p>
	<p align="justify" style="widows: 2; font-weight: normal; orphans: 2">
	Both Ken and Glenn remarked
	about loads being too big for the barn doors – sometimes getting
	stuck or otherwise being a tight squeeze.  Walter used to make a
	hole at the front of the load so he could be well below the top of
	the door when driving into the barn.</p>
	<p align="justify" style="widows: 2; font-weight: normal; orphans: 2">
	&nbsp;</p>
	<p align="justify" style="widows: 2; font-weight: normal; orphans: 2">
	Ken mentioned that John had a
	load of hay on the big truck, see photo, and it jammed so hard that
	the rear stakes broke and the hay tumbled into the yard.</p>
	<p align="justify" style="widows: 2; font-weight: normal; orphans: 2">
	&nbsp;</p>
	<p align="justify" style="widows: 2; font-weight: normal; orphans: 2">
	Hay was unloaded by means of a
	“forker or hay fork”.  Some forks were a single spear that
	pushed into the hay and then the point, which was on a hinge, would
	be set to secure the hay.  Double forks were in the shape of a “U”.
	 The hay was hoisted by means of a long rope and set of pulleys so
	that it rose from the wagon and went to either left or right to the
	loft or haymow.  When over the mow, the load was tripped by means of
	a light rope and the load fell and was spread by one or two men.</p>
	<p align="justify" style="widows: 2; font-weight: normal; orphans: 2">
	&nbsp;</p>
	<p align="justify" style="widows: 2; font-weight: normal; orphans: 2">
	A horse was hooked to the outer
	end of the forker line and, on a signal, would walk away from the
	barn lifting the hay from the wagon.  With a shout from the barn,
	the horse was stopped, the forker line slackened, the horse was
	turned and went back to the edge of the barn door to await another
	load.  As the youngest, my job was to drive the horse on the forker
	line.  A load of hay was usually taken of in 6 “bites”</p>
	<p align="justify" style="widows: 2; font-weight: normal; orphans: 2">
	&nbsp;</p>
	<p align="justify" style="widows: 2; font-weight: normal; orphans: 2">
	One time when we were haying in
	Napan at “Jimmie MacKnight’s? (Just above Edith Bremner’s), my
	job was to take the old truck to Nevin’s garage in Chatham to have
	the brakes fixed  - a regular occurrence as I recall.  As I neared
	MacDiarmid’s barn, a horse started walking across the road and,
	attached to it was a forker line about 30 inches above the ground.</p>
	<p align="justify" style="widows: 2; font-weight: normal; orphans: 2">
	I geared down as best I could to
	slow down the truck but contact between the truck and the forker
	line was imminent.  Fortunately, just before contact was made,
	someone in the barn tripped the load and the line dropped to the
	road and I passed over.</p>

	Was talking to Teddy Fowlie who
	reminisced about a trip up the Little Branch River above Fowlie’s
	mill.  At a junction, called the Forks, at one time there was an inn
	for travelers coming from Richibucto to Black River and on to the
	mouth of the Miramichi.  I hadn’t heard of this before</p>
