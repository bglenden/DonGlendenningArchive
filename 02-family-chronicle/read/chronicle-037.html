<div class="reader-summary">Don reflects on family wanderlust, documenting how both Glendenning and Watling relatives emigrated to the USA in the early 1900s seeking work (Maine, Boston, Florida, Tennessee, Virginia). He recounts his mother Jane Watling&#x27;s arrival in Portland on January 24, 1908—the day city hall burned—and her meeting with his father. Includes vivid memories of winter woodcutting experiences with his brothers, describing horses, bobsleds, cross-cut saws, and the sensory details of forest work (snow, hymn-singing, horse bells, creaking loads). Published November 18, 2005.</div>

	The above photo was taken in
	Berlin, New Hampshire.  Although not dated, in the context of family
	information, it was probably taken between 1900 and 1910.  Many
	Maritimers, including Black River residents, worked in the woods
	during this period, Whether or not any are in this photo is unclear.
	 My Dad, Elmer Glendenning, had crews in the Maine and New Hampshire
	woods during this period; these may be some of his teams but I do
	not know for sure. In the early part of the century, I am told that
	there were three trains each day leaving Prince Edward Island and
	making connections with trains to the “Boston States”.  I would
	welcome information or photos about others from our area that worked
	in the woods at this time.</p>

<h5>
	Follow-up</h5>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>Mention of
	a blacksmith shop struck a chord with Donald Edge who remembers the
	blacksmith shop operated in Upper Black River by John Dick.  Donald
	says that he visited John Dick’s also to have a tooth pulled and a
	fishhook removed from a finger.</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<h5>Dentist</h5>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>At one
	time, Black River had a resident dentist in the person of Doug
	Dower.  His office was set up David Murdoch’s house on the north
	side of the river just below Uncle Jack Godfrey’s.  I cannot
	recall whether this was a full-time or part time office.  I do
	remember, though, that Cameron Russell, my brother-in-law, went to
	him one Sunday afternoon to have a tooth extracted – extracted, as
	I recall, without the aid of laughing gas or freezing; Norman
	remembers going to Doug Dower also on Sunday.  I think that he soon
	closed his office and moved to Chatham.  Years later, he had a
	fishing/ hunting camp on the river just above the Horton’s Creek
	bridge.</p>
	<h5>Wanderlust</h5>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>I am
	interested in the fact that so many of the Glendennings and
	Watlings, lived and worked in the USA.  On the Watling side, Mum,
	Jane, went to Portland just before her 18<sup>th</sup> birthday;
	Uncle Jack worked in the Boston area and eventually retired to an
	Island near Portland, Uncle George lived in Portland for a while but
	also worked in Tennessee and Virginia before moving to New
	Hampshire; Aunt Janet worked at the Waltham watch factory but
	returned to Black River, Uncle Jim worked for a number of years in a
	chemists/ photography shop in Portland but came back to Little
	Branch after his father died; Uncle Ern worked with Dad in Tennessee
	before enlisting in WW1.</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>On the
	Glendenning side, Dad, Elmer, operated a trucking business with his
	brothers in Portland and also lumbered in New Hampshire and likely
	Maine.  After their marriage in 1910, Dad worked on construction
	sites in Tennessee, Connecticut, Virginia, Wisconsin, Alabama and
	Texas; Aunt Venetia lived near Portland and eventually moved to
	Florida; Uncle Guy went to school Dental school in the USA, worked
	in the USA and Peru and eventually settled in Florida; Uncle Chip
	worked for a number of years in Peru; Uncle Ray worked in Portland
	and may have worked in the woods in New Hampshire; Aunt Minnie lived
	most of her life on Long Island, Aunt Margaret finished high school
	in Portland, then took nurses training, she served as a nurse during
	WW1 and settled in Maine; Uncle Leonard lived for a number of years
	in Maine but returned to NB; Aunt Maude and Uncle Jim Cormier lived
	in New Hampshire but returned to NB.</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>My mother
	told of her arrival in Portland on January 24, 1908, a month before
	her 18<sup>th</sup> birthday.  She arrived on the day the city hall
	burned.  She was to stay with Uncle George.  She arrived at the
	train station early in the morning but Uncle George did not show. 
	Apparently he had come to the railway depot but he had been away for
	a number of years and did not recognize the grown, young woman in
	the station waiting room. 
	</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>Less than
	three weeks later my Grandfather Glendenning died while visiting
	family in Portland. Mother knew, or knew of, the Glendennings by
	then and could have gone to the funeral.  Instead, as I recall, she
	looked after someone’s children – children of Adam and Millie
	(Glendenning) MacLean.  I have always been curious as to how Mum and
	Dad met.</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>I find it
	interesting that both sides of our family were so venturesome and
	would welcome information about members of the next generation who
	traveled to the USA to seek employment.  I would be glad to print
	the information in future issues of the Chronicle.</p>

	<h5>Saturday
	Work</h5>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>I have
	three distinct recollections of going to the woods for the purpose
	of cutting wood – not just three days but three distinct
	experiences.  The first, and earliest, was when I went for the
	outing but was not expected to be of help.  I do remember melting
	the snow to make tea, eating sandwiches touched by frost, and moving
	around to keep warm.</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>The second
	experience would be going to the woods with John.  I would be 14 –
	16 at the time.  Presumably that was when Norm and Ken were in the
	service.  My role was a supportive one.  I took my place on the end
	of the cross cut saw (being cautioned not to drag my feet), did some
	limbing, drove the horse when loading large logs and took one end
	when loading smaller pieces.</p>
	<p>After
	trees were cut and cut into 12-16 foot pieces, they were pulled to
	the side of the wood road.  Skids were placed with one end on the
	ground in front of the logs and the other end placed on top of the
	sled or the last row of logs on the sled.  A chain was placed around
	the log so that the horse moved forward at right angles to the sled,
	which caused the log to roll up onto the sled.  Not surprising,
	there was/is a science to building a large load – as there is to
	building a large load of loose hay.  Although John expected me to do
	my share, he did not ask more than I could handle.  He also ensured
	that I was warm and dry and always had a horse rug under me when
	sitting on cold logs  (This, as I recall, was to minimize the
	likelihood of piles.)</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>The next
	experiences, as I recall, were after Norm returned from the service.
	 I remember especially the warm, sunny February and March days.  It
	still involved being on the end of a cross cut saw and all of the
	other work but now I was older, stronger and experienced.  Norm was
	quite competitive and we used to make a game out of determining
	where a tree would fall, guessing the length of a log or tree, etc.</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>We always
	used a team of horses and a bobsled – two sleds hooked together
	with crossed chains.  A bobsled allowed for larger and longer loads
	and gave maximum flexibility over rough wood roads.  I have many
	positive memories of my woods experiences: sitting on the sled with
	my feet on the runner, folding the horse rug over the axe head and
	using it as a cushion, sitting on top of a load of logs on the way
	home, John singing hymns as we came home on a snowy evening, dodging
	the snow from snow-laden bows as we traveled to and from the woods,
	being able to identify spruce, fir, maple, beech and ash although
	there weren’t many of the latter, pine although we rarely cut
	those, coming out of the woods and seeing the light at home,
	unhitching the horses and taking off the harness in the barn, the
	fires to make tea although this was later replaced by thermos
	bottles, the sound of the horse bells, the creaking loads as the
	snaked over the hummocks, turns and dips in the road and the crunch
	of the runners on the crisp snow.
