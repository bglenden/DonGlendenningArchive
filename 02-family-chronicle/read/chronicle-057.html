	Mud Digger</h6>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">One
	winter a mud digger was set up on the ice behind our barn on the far
	side of the channel.  As I recall, it had a wooden frame about 12 to
	15 feet square and a huge shovel or scoop, which was lowered,
	through the ice to the river bottom.  A mud digger was powered by a
	horse or horses and with the aid of pulleys raised scoops of mud and
	deposited them in sleds.  The mud was hauled to farmland which had
	been plowed earlier in the year and spread.  Mussel mud was rich in
	nutrients including lime from the mussel shells.  A load of mussel
	mud was very heavy.</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">One
	summer we built a raft at our shore and then poled it out into the
	river to be used as a diving platform.  I recall anchoring it over
	the place where the mud had been dug then jumping off and trying to
	reach bottom.  I didn’t (yet); others may have.  Recently Cameron
	MacDonald reminded me that we (presumably some of the other boys,
	not me) pushed him off the raft into deep water and he couldn’t
	swim.</p>
	<h6 align="justify" style="orphans: 0; widows: 0"></h6>
	<h6 align="justify" style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">Follow-up</h6>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">Mentioning
	the shortening pail reminded Donald Edge of carrying limejuice to
	his grandfather, John W. MacNaughton, on hot summer days.  He
	mentioned Rose’s lime juice; we used Montserrat.</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">Limejuice was a common drink when
	making hay.  Like Donald, my role was to carry limejuice to my
	brothers.  Limejuice and sugar were mixed in cold water.  It
	provided a cold drink – at least as cold as the water pumped from
	a well.  (We, in Little Branch, did not have the luxury of
	electricity at that time.)  Limejuice was refreshing – I must try
	it again some again some hot day.</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">We
	purchased our limejuice at Adams’ store, directly across the river
	from us.  The story is told, I may even be repeating myself, of
	someone going to the store and asking Mr. Adams if he had any
	limejuice.  He is reported to have answered, “Well, I have some of
	that Muskrat juice ( Montserrat Juice).”  From then on, limejuice
	at our house was known as muskrat juice.

	<p align="justify" style="page-break-after: avoid"><b>Robert
	Standfield</b></p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">I was saddened by the recent
	death of Robert Standfield .  He was from a prominent family, the
	makers of Standfield’s underwear, former Premier of Nova Scotia,
	former leader of the federal Progressive Conservative Party and, in
	the words of some, the best Prime Minister Canada never had.”   
	He was personally much respected and much loved.</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">A
	number of years ago, probably about 1990, I attended a meeting in
	Kingston, Ontario.  I flew to Montreal and rented a car to take me
	to Kingston.  At the close of the meeting, I was asked if Mr.
	Standfield could a company me back to the Montreal airport.  I said
	yes; I was delighted.  He had retired from active politics by then.</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">On
	a fine summer’s day, we spent two leisurely hours together.  He
	was both a good conversationalist and a good listener.  We talked
	about life in politics, education (he was a former Minister of
	Education in Nova Scotia, and just general conversation.  I will
	always treasure those two hours.
