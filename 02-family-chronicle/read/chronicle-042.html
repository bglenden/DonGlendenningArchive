<p><b>The Family</b> <b>Chronicle</b><b></b></p>
<p>No.42										<span class="Apple-converted-space">              </span>June 7, 2003</p>
<p><span><span class="Apple-converted-space">                                                                                                                                 </span>________________</span><span><b>Meadows to Little Branch</b></span></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>Jubal Watling married a Susan Leach in Metfield, Suffolk County, England on November 14, 1814 and moved to Syleham, Suffolk County, England where their son, Jubal, was baptized on August 17, 1823.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They likely stayed in England, however, the following children came to Canada:</p>
<p>Jubal who married Christina MacNaughton</p>
<p>William who married Mary MacNaughton</p>
<p>Mary Ann who married William Maxwell</p>
<p>George who moved to the USA</p>
<p>Emma who married William Eddy</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Jubal Watling petitioned for land (F4243) on the south side of Black River on April 9, 1851, presumably this is the Jubal who married Christina MacNaughton.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They also had a son, Jubal.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Alexander MacDonald was granted Lot #2 on the Little Black River on June 2, 1812.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Half the property passed to his son, John, (where Uncle Jim Watling lived) and the other half passed to his daughter, Jessie.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My father bought the Jessie MacDonald property on July 21, 1914.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Grace, the daughter of John and Elspeth (Jardine) Watling married Jubal Watling on Dec 22, 1874 and, moved to Lot #30 in The Meadows.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>(The Meadows has long since been reclaimed by the forests.)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>All of their children were born there.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I believe that the elder Jubal died in 1900 and his wife, Christina died in 1901; Grace’s father, John MacDonald also died in 1900.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Graces mother was not well<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>(She died of “debility” in 1907) and Grace’s brother, James, was living at home but was not able to look after the farm. An agreement was struck late in 1901 for Elspeth MacDonald and her son, James, to turn over the property at Little Branch to Grace and Jubal.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In return, Grace and Jubal, and their sons, agreed to “keep, support, maintain and provide the said James J. MacDonald and his mother, Mrs. John D. MacDonald, each of them and the survivor of them during the respective terms of their natural lives with good and sufficient house, roof, meat, drink, washing, clothing, bedding, fire, light, medicine, medical attendance, personal expenses and all such necessaries as persons of their ages and conditions in life usually require and are accustomed to.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>agreement was also signed by all of the sons.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>My Grandfather, Jubal, died on February 16, 1915 and Uncle Jim came home from Portland to take over the farm and look after his mother.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Janice Cowan, presumably of the Miramichi Press, interviewed Uncle Jim and wrote the following:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b><i>Recalls Christmas in 1890’s</i></b><b><i></i></b></p>
<p><i><span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span>The smell of delicious cooking in an Upper Black River Farmhouse kitchen during the 1890’s is what James Watling remembers about his first boyhood Christmases.</i></p>
<p><i><span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span>Watling, 94, now a resident of the Miramichi Senior Citizens Home said: We always had plenty to eat.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I can’t remember turkey, but we had chicken and roast pork.”</i></p>
<p><i><span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span>On Christmas Eve after the eight Watling children had finished the farm chores they hung up their stockings at the foot of their beds.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></i></p>
<p><i><span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span>“We were tickled to death to find an orange, an apple or candy in them in the morning.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Or perhaps a pair of newly knitted socks,” he said.</i></p>
<p><i><span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span>There were no luxuries.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Things were homemade, but we made do with very simple things.</i></p>
<p><i><span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span>The sheep provided us with wool, which was carded and woven into jackets, pants and sweaters.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The girls could make clothes for their dolls.</i></p>
<p><i><span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span>People go overboard at Christmas these days.</i></p>
<p><i><span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span>“It seems to be ‘get all that you can’ and ‘give all you can’.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It’s not what Christmas is supposed to be at all.”</i></p>
<p><b><i>What Christmas Means</i></b></p>
<p><i><span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span>“Christmas to a great many people is just the chance for another holiday.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My parents were Christian people.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They tried to bring us up as best they could with the knowledge that Christmas meant the birth of Christ.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We had Bible reading at the table.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>All this has disappeared.</i></p>
<p><i><span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span>“Too much money is spent these days, especially when we know many people in other parts of the world are starving to death.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This is not the Christian spirit”.</i></p>
<p><i><span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span>James Watling’s father, Jubal Watling was a lumberman.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He and his crew were in the woods in wintertime including Christmas. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></i></p>
<p><i><span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span>So the chores were done by the children, Christina, Elspeth, George, Janet, Jack, James, Jane and Ernest.</i></p>
<p><i></i><br></p>
<p><i><span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span>The Watling family also celebrated New Year’s Day “as most Scotspeople do.</i></p>
<p><i><span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span>We seemed to have more snow in those days,” laughs Watling.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I think that’s because the roads weren’t snowploughed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They were kept open using the horses.</i></p>
<p><i><span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span>Sometimes a storm would confine us to our home.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We were a mile from the more settled part of Black River.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We had two close farming neighbours, Donald Cameron and Gardiner Archibald.</i></p>
<p><b><i>Made own fun</i></b></p>
<p><i><span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span>“At Christmas time we would sometimes meet at each other’s house and play games, or dance or sing.</i></p>
<p><i><span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span>“People were very friendly and made their own fun in those days.”</i></p>
<p><i><span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span>“Watling cannot remember having a Christmas tree in those early days.”</i></p>
<p><i><span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span>“I don’t think that we bothered with them.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There was no such thing as decorations or trimming.”</i></p>
<p><i><span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span>“He went to school in Upper Black River.</i></p>
<p><i><span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span>“We walked in the horse tracks through the snow in the winter,” Watling recalled.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was about a mile to school.”</i></p>
<p><i><span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span>The school was a one-room school, with one teacher for 40 students.</i></p>
<p><i><span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span>“Out of that class came a doctor, lawyer, bookkeeper and three or four teachers,” said Watling.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></i></p>
<p><b><i>Home made outings</i></b></p>
<p><i>On Christmas Day, the children would play out on their homemade toboggans.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They also had snow shoes made out of pieces of straight cedar.</i></p>
<p><i><span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span>“We split them down thin and shaved them.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We called them racquets.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They would carry you easily through the snow and into the woods.”</i></p>
<p><i><span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span>The youngsters had skates too, and James remembers skating on a wide drain, falling down hitting his head and “seeing stars”.</i></p>
<p><i><span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span>“People were happy in those days”, said Watling.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“They lived off the land.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The community was helpful if you were in trouble.”</i></p>
<p><i><span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span>Watling said the women in those days, including his own mother Grace (MacDonald) worked hard.</i></p>
<p><i><span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span>“The main thing is there was substantial food and we all enjoyed it,” added Watling.</i></p>
<p><i><span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span>He took over the Black River Farm from his father and he and his wife Catherine lived there with their four sons and a daughter.</i></p>

<p>My recent Email included a number of items about Frances Jane MacDougall MacDonald, daughter of Kenneth and Catherine (McGraw) MacDonald.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Here is a copy of the poem she wrote.</p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b><i>BLACK RIVER</i></b><b><i></i></b></p>
<p><i></i><br></p>
<p><i>Flow gently Black River, flow on to the bay</i></p>
<p><i>By the happy old homes, as you pass on your way.</i></p>
<p><i>As I stand by your bank in the hush of the dawn,</i></p>
<p><i>I think of the people and days that are gone.</i></p>
<p><i></i><br></p>
<p><i>From a small, rippling brook, over many a ridge</i></p>
<p><i>You come dancing along ‘neath the old covered bridge;</i></p>
<p><i>And you blink at MacNaughtons, MacLeans and MacRaes,</i></p>
<p><i>As you glisten so brightly in the sun’s sparkling rays.</i></p>
<p><i></i><br></p>
<p><i>But softly you glide as the point comes in view,</i></p>
<p><i>There our loved ones are sleeping, it seemed that you knew</i></p>
<p><i>That once, they too watched you go rippling by</i></p>
<p><i>Then a moment you paused there, then passed with a sigh.</i></p>
<p><i></i><br></p>
<p><i>But on you must hasten, past MacDougalls, McKnights,</i></p>
<p><i>And then from MacDonalds, through dim misty light</i></p>
<p><i>Echoes music and laughter like a bird that has flown,</i></p>
<p><i>And I stand by the river – and dream there alone.</i></p>
<p><i></i><br></p>
<p><i>Flow calmly Black River what stories you know</i></p>
<p><i>Of courage and vision. of sorrow and woe</i></p>
<p><i>Of the plans for the future of joys yet to come</i></p>
<p><i>And the happy reunions as we met at each home.</i></p>
<p><i></i><br></p>
<p><i>Flow softly Black River may your spell always last,</i></p>
<p><i>And watch o’er our kin as you have in the past;</i></p>
<p><i>May they learn to love you and find as you flow,</i></p>
<p><i>The secret of courage and faith you bestow.</i></p>
<p><i></i><br></p>
<p><i>Flow ever Black River, flow on to the sea</i></p>
<p><i>And bear on thy water this message from me</i></p>
<p><i>To those who now watch you, there’s faith deep and strong</i></p>
<p><i>To be found in thy depths, so meet life with a song.</i></p>
<p><i></i><br></p>
<p><i>We’ve left thee Black River, but ever we know</i></p>
<p><i>Your influence and vision around us will flow;</i></p>
<p><i>And your sweet lullaby will hush us to sleep,</i></p>
<p><i>When we rest at “The Point” and your vigil you keep.</i></p>
<p><br></p>
