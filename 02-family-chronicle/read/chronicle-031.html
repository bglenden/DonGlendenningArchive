<p><b>George Emerson at Little Branch?</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Although I was quite good at spelling, geography was always tricky.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The sentence below was an aid to remembering:</p>

<p><b>The Muddy Trail</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Both Jack Wilson and my brother, Ken, tell me that the poem, The Muddy Trail, printed in the last <b>Chronicle</b> was written by Murdoch Sullivan who lived on the South Side of Black River.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>According to Jack, the poem was likely written between 1968 and 1974 when the road was paved.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>After the road was paved, Murdoch wrote the following piece of poetry.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b><i>The Road We Long Waited for come At Last</i></b></p>
<p><b><i></i></b><br></p>
<p><b><i>It happened in the summer</i></b></p>
<p><b><i>Of nineteen seventy-four,</i></b></p>
<p><b><i>When the gravel it rushed down the south-side,</i></b></p>
<p><b><i>Just like the Tidal Bore.</i></b></p>
<p><b><i></i></b><br></p>
<p><b><i>Some folks they were smiling,</i></b></p>
<p><b><i>And others were afraid,</i></b></p>
<p><b><i>That it was just an election dodge,</i></b></p>
<p><b><i>But the hard-top it was laid.</i></b></p>
<p><b><i></i></b><br></p>
<p><b><i>They built it high, they made it wide,</i></b></p>
<p><b><i>It is Black River's pride,</i></b></p>
<p><b><i>The folks all say they're on Broadway,</i></b></p>
<p><b><i>When they come down the south-side.</i></b></p>
<p><b><i></i></b><br></p>
<p><b><i>For long years we have waited,</i></b></p>
<p><b><i>Many dollars they've been spent,</i></b></p>
<p><b><i>But I never thought that I would live</i></b></p>
<p><b><i>To see this great event.</i></b></p>
<p><b><i></i></b><br></p>
<p><b><i>For many years I've walked this road,</i></b></p>
<p><b><i>Many times I can recall,</i></b></p>
<p><b><i>The muddy road that we once knew-</i></b></p>
<p><b><i>We had to face it, spring and fall.</i></b></p>
<p><b><i></i></b><br></p>
<p><b><i>But those days they are all past and gone,</i></b></p>
<p><b><i>Like the morning dew has fled,</i></b></p>
<p><b><i>As we look into the future</i></b></p>
<p><b><i>For the years that lie ahead.</i></b></p>
<p><b><i></i></b><br></p>
<p><b><i>So here are cheers to all the boys,</i></b></p>
<p><b><i>Our truckmen one and all,</i></b></p>
<p><b><i>For the muddy trail will ne'er prevail,</i></b></p>
<p><b><i>When the big rains come this fall.</i></b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Electric Power</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>Electric power came, as I recall, to Black River in the fall of 1948.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The hydro poles had been put in and wires strung the year before.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Mum had the house wired, I think, by Harry Simmonds, months before power was turned on.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I was teaching at the Miramichi at the time and remember coming home from school, probably in September or October, and looking up the hill to see the house lighted for the first time.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Seems to me that Norm put in an electric water pump that Christmas and a hot water heater the following Christmas (1949).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I remember helping with both.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He also ran a water line to the barn, dug about by hand 5 feet deep either in 1950 or 1951.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The reason I remember the latter is that I was at NBIT at the time and had a float chamber made in the welding shop.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We used a toilet valve to control the water level and a couple of light bulbs as a float.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The float chamber was located near the entrance from the cowbarn to the barn floor and a pipe run along the stalls.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was gravity fed to the individual drinking bowls.</p>

<p><b>Apology</b></p>

<p>I apologize for overloading your computers with such a large photo in the last issue; as you can tell, I am somewhat technologically challenged.</p>

<p><b>Suffolk, England</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>My great grandfather, Jubal Watling was born in Suffolk county England in 1823.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Suffolk County was described in 1812 as follows:</p>
<p><b><i>"Suffolk, an English<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>HYPERLINK "http://www.genuki.org.uk/big/eng/SFK/map.html" </i></b><span><b><i>COUNTY</i></b></span><b><i> 47 miles in length and 30 miles in breadth, bounded on the West by Cambridgeshire, on the North by Norfolk, on the South by Essex and on the East by the German Ocean. It contains 575 parishes, 28 market towns and sends 16 members to Parliament. The air is generally wholesome, but the soil is various, on the sea coast it is sandy and there are several small hills which yield hemp, pease and rye. The inland parts are clayey and more full of trees. The borders towards Essex are fit for pastures and the NW produces corn of all sorts. There are manufactures of several kinds, particularly all sorts of broad-cloth, stuffs and coarse linen. The principal rivers are Little Ouse, the Waveney, the Stour, The Breton, the Orwell or Gippe, the Ore and the Blyth. Ipswich and St.Edmundsberry are the principal towns".<br>
<br>
From "The Complete and Universal Dictionary" by Rev James Barclay – 1812</i></b><b><i></i></b></p>
<p>Quite a change from there to carving out a homestead at the Meadows in the mid-1800s</p>
<p><b>Teachers at Little Branch</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Dorothy (MacKay) Lind reminded me that her mother, Mildred MacKay and family, stayed with Aunt Kate and Uncle Jim during the school year 1942-1943 and the teacher was Mrs. Freddie (Minnie) Fowlie.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Among other things Dorothy mentioned was playing cards at the long table in our dining room.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Would that have been “Flinch?”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I have the game but do not know the rules.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Fraser MacKay</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Donald Edge shared some recollections of living and visiting Black River.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Among his recollections he mentioned Fraser MacKay.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Fraser went to the Miramichi High School; he was a couple of grades ahead of me.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In the summer he walked or biked from his Grand father’s place to the Middle Black River Crossroads; in the winter, he stayed through the week at home.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>One time in Industrial Arts class, I was struggling to make a small letter-holder.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Fraser took time to show me how to do it properly.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Another time after a heavy snowfall, George Watling, Fraser and I went up the back side of our barn with pieces of cardboard for slides.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We wanted to slide down the steel roof.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Fraser went first – whoosh – and landed on a hard snow bank.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He was winded; all he could do was wave at us not to try it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>George and I climbed down the way we went up.</p>
