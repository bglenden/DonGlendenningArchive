	Black River Community Halls</h1>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>Family Chronicle No. 96 gave a brief history of
	the First Community Hall in Black River, built in 1930.  My plea for
	photos brought no results.  Thanks, however, to Everard and Bertie
	MacLean, I am able to provide some photos of the second one. (See
	Family Chronicle No. 97)</p>

	</p>
	<p>The second
	building, erected in 1933, was a two- story structure without the
	shed on the front; it was added in 1966.  .</p>

	<p>Is
	that Everard MacLean standing at the door?</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>In
	1966, to commemorate our 100 years as a country, funds were made
	available for community projects. The upgrading and additions shown
	above were the result and the name was changed to the Black River
	Centennial Hall.</p>

	<h2><b>An extract of two letters in the Chatham
	Gazette</b></h2>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>While reading
	some old Chatham Gazettes recently, I came across a the following
	references to the Black River Community Hall.</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>A
	letter in the Gazette of Monday, July 17, 1933 (BLACK RIVER FARMER
	WRITES TO THE GAZETTE) included the following paragraphs”</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>“<i>to relieve the
	depression in our district the community decided to rebuild the
	community Hall which was burned to the ground last summer.  The
	plans and specifications were drawn up by the building committee and
	tenders called for.  The contract was awarded to our local
	contractor Frank MacDougall who was the lowest tenderer.</i></p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p><i>The inspectors report the
	work well advanced and in a satisfactory manner.  It is all boarded
	in and the roof shingled.  The lumber was supplied by our local
	sawmills, Fowlie Brothers and John W. MacNaughton.”</i></p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>On
	Monday, July 24 a letter appeared with the following heading
	“PECULIAR THEFT AT BLACK RIVER BR. NEW HALL”.  The first
	paragraph reads as follows:</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>“<i>In reading a Farmer’s
	letter in your recent issue and noting what it said about the
	Community Hall building, I would like to say that there must be
	someone else building, as there was a man seen on the road one night
	last week with a load of shingles.  And when the carpenters came to
	work  at the hall next morning they found the shingles had all
	disappeared with the exception of one bundle; also about fifty
	pounds of shingle nails.  The thief seemed to have a considerate
	streak in him too, as the contractor needed one bunch of shingles to
	finish the roof of the hall and one bunch was left out of the pile. 
	The new hall is about completed with windows and doors in place.”</i></p>
	<p><br />

	<h1>Cold Friday</h1>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>February
	8, 1861 is known as cold Friday in New Brunswick.  It came,
	apparently, at the end of a long cold spell and fuel supplies became
	both scarce and expensive.  The cold was accompanied by extremely
	high winds.</p>
	<p><br />
