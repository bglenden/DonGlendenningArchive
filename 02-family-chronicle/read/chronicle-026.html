<p>No.26										<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>July 9, 2002</p>
<p><span><span class="Apple-converted-space">                                                                                                                                  </span>__________</span></p>
<p><span></span>My search for Watling roots has been less extensive than that on the Glendenning side, nevertheless, I will record what I have and add as time and energy permit.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Some time ago, Edith (MacKenzie) Schickle gave me a copy of information given to her by Ernie Watling.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Much of the information which follows comes from that source although I have been able to augment it from other sources.</p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Origin of Name</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>The first record of the name was found in Sussex, England somewhere between London and Dover.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is likely that the name arises from Wartling which was a hamlet in the area but others believe that it was associated with Watling Road, the great Roman Road, which started near Dover, passed through Canterbury , turned north at London and went as far as St Albans <span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>It is thought, that the Watlings were Vikings who landed in Northern Scotland in 870 AD, invaded northern France in 910 AD and then came to England with William the Conqueror in 1066.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The name is found in the Domesday Book which was a census taken in England in 1086.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>By the time of Richard 1, the Watling name had spread north to Watlingford in Oxfordshire, Watlington in Norfolk, Essex and Hertfordshire.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Many Norman families moved north to Scotland in the 12<sup>th</sup> century and this may have included some Watlings.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Watling is thought to share the same roots as Whatling, Watlington, Watlingtone, Whatlington, Whatlingtone, Wadling, and Wadlingdon.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Over time, the name spread into the northern parts of England and to Scotland as well.</p>
<p>Kinsmen of the family Watling who came to North America include Ffrances Watling who settled in Virginia in 1660, John Watling who landed in America in 1753, James Watling settled in Philadelphia in 1842 and Mary Watlington who settled in Antigua in 1679.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Some Watlings moved to Canada after the American Revolution.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p><b>Watling Street</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>Watling Street was a major road built by the Romans after they invaded Britain in 55 BC.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It started at near Dover, passing through Canterbury (a street sign bears the name) and on to London.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>From London, Watling Road runs north and west passing through St. Albans<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>(ancient Verulamium) a distance of about 200 km.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Blazon of Arms</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The Blazon of Arms for Watling is described as “</p>
<p><b>Argent Six Escutcheons Sable</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>and the crest<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Out of a human heart a dexter hand grasping a sabre all proper</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Canadian Roots</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>My direct ancestors include 3 Jubal Watlings.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If my information is correct:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Jubal 1, my GG Grandfather, was born in Suffolk England, married Susan Leach and may or may not have come to Canada let alone Black River.</p>
<p>Jubal 2, my Great Grandfather, was born in Suffolk, England in 1818, came to Black River via Cape Breton and settled in Black River about 1850.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He married Christina MacNaughton.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He died in 1900.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Jubal 3, my Grandfather, was born in 1846 and married Grace MacDonald.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He died in 1915.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I am still searching to confirm or amend the above.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Leech</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>A maternal GG Grandmother was a Leech.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Leech, Leitch comes from the old English meaning “doctor”.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The name Leitch is widespread in Scotland but also is mentioned specifically in Assynt which is where Alexander Macdonald came from.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Other variations include Leche, Lech, Leyche and Leiche.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Pious Pirate</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>San Salvador Island is part of the Bahamas.<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>On Sandy Point sits Watling Castle.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The island was originally named Watling’s Island in honour of Captain George Watling a famous buccaneer and pirate.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>(It was renamed in 1926).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He was also known as the “pious pirate” because he would not allow his crew to play cards or indulge in piracy on the Sabbath.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The name Watling appears frequently in literature about the Bahamas.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There may have also been a pirate named John Watling.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I am sure that neither of these were part of our family.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Fowlie</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>In reading <span>First Families of the Miramichi</span> I found a note on James Fowlie MA, LLD, FRSC; I do not remember hearing of him before.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He was the son of George Fowlie and Jean (Jane) McKnight and was born at Little Branch on July 16, 1829 and died on January 11, 1923.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He was married to Ann MacLeod and had no children. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>He was ordained a Presbyterian Minister on May 19, 1857, became a Science Master (taught) at the Provincial Normal School<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>in Fredericton in 1878 and became Professor of Biology at Queens University in 1880 from where he retired in 1907</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Alexander MacDonald<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The Gaelic spelling of MacDonald, meaning the son of Donald, is Mac Dhomhnuill.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>– but there were many Donald’s.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The Macdonalds were a very large clan having taken many septs under their wing.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Alexander MacDonald,my GG Grandfather, was a native of the Parish of Assynt in Rossshire, Scotland.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Rossshire is on the northern part of the west coast of<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Scotland and includes many islands.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Alexander’s wife, Grace McAskill came from Sutherland County which adjoins Rossshire on the north.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That area of Scotland is hilly and rocky with many inlets and streams and little land suitable for cultivation.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Another source reports that Alexander and Grace came from the same parish. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
