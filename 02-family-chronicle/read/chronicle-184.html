	Introduction:
	I grew up in the Parish of Simonds, Carleton Co., N.B. From age 3 to
	11 I lived on the Charlie Ebbett farm. Ivan was my younger brother.
	Arch Ginson 's drag saw was similar to the one in the: picture on
	the cover of this issue. In place of a horsepower he had a Waterloo
	engine, which was common in rural Carleton Co. in the 1930's, but
	horsepower’s were still in use at that time too.

	<p style="widows: 2; orphans: 2; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
	A
	little beyond the wagon shed on the Charlie Ebbett farm there was a
	pile of wood. Sometimes it was in long lengths waiting to be sawed
	into blocks. Sometimes it was in blocks waiting to be split. And
	sometimes it was split into pieces that would fit into the firebox
	in the kitchen range, with larger chunks set aside for the triple
	heater. 
	</p>
	<p style="widows: 2; orphans: 2; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
	<br />

	</p>
	<p style="widows: 2; orphans: 2; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
	After
	the ground was frozen in December, and before the snow was so deep
	that it was difficult to travel in the fields and through the woods,
	Dad would harness the horses in the morning and hitch them to the
	bobsleds. Ivan and I would often go with him on the sleds, or on
	very cold mornings walk behind to keep warm, past the barn and about
	a mile out through the fields to the woods. 
	</p>

	<p style="widows: 2; orphans: 2; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
	Mum
	would make sandwiches, roast beef or pork, sometimes chicken or
	turkey, which we took with us, along with cookies or doughnuts. At
	noon Dad would build a fire, boil the kettle, and thaw the
	sandwiches. The kettle, a five pound lard pail with a wire bail for
	a handle, was suspended over the fire on a pole about an inch in
	diameter and six or seven feet long, laid in the &quot;Y&quot; of a
	forked stick driven into the ground beside the fire. Snow was melted
	until there was enough water for tea. 
	</p>
	<p style="widows: 2; orphans: 2; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
	<br />

	</p>
	<p style="orphans: 2; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%; widows: 2">
	There
	was an art to boiling the kettle. The water had to be brought to a
	rolling boil over the fire, then the kettle swung away with the pole
	and set in the snow. When the water stopped boiling a handful of
	loose tea was thrown into the kettle. It was then swung back over
	the fire until the water boiled a second time, after which it was
	immediately removed and a half cup of cold water dashed in, to
	settle the tea grounds. Then the brew was poured into tin cups and
	drunk without milk or additives.

	<p style="orphans: 2; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%; widows: 2">
	Dad
	worked in the lumber woods from the time he was a teenager, and was
	good with an axe, a cross-cut saw and a peavey. He cut maple, birch
	and beech for firewood, and a few cedars for kindling. He trimmed
	off the smaller branches in the woods and cut the logs and larger
	branches into twelve-foot lengths. Using one of the horses, a
	whiffletree and a twitching chain, he yarded the logs to a landing
	as they were cut. Late in the afternoon, using his peavey to roll
	the larger logs on to the bobsleds, he made the load for the journey
	back to the house. The bigger logs were put on the bottom, and the
	two outside ones were fastened to the bobsled rockers with corner
	binds (chains run through a hole bored in the rocker with an auger,
	then wrapped around the log and secured with grab hooks). Smaller
	logs were put on top and held in place by top chains. On cold days,
	the runners squeaked on the snow, and icicles formed on the horses'
	nostrils as they inhaled and exhaled more heavily while pulling the
	big load.

	Late
	in March or early in April, Arch Ginson would arrive in the
	community with his wood sawing outfit, having brought it across the
	river on the ice from Upper Brighton. He would saw for several of
	the farmers in Simonds, including us. First he would set up the
	circular saw and cut the smaller logs and branches into 16-inch
	lengths. Afterward the drag saw would be moved into place and the
	larger logs, which were too heavy to lift onto the table of the
	circular saw, would also be cut into 16-inch lengths. A Waterloo
	engine, steam gently rising from its open reservoir, with two
	three-foot-diameter flywheels, one on each side, spark plug fired by
	a magneto, and connected by a wide leather drive belt to the sawing
	machines, was used for power. 
	</p>
	<p style="widows: 2; orphans: 2; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
	<br />

	</p>
	<p style="widows: 2; orphans: 2; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
	In
	the 1930s we had no money. Few farmers in New Brunswick did. So
	Arch, when he was finished sawing, took toll - he took with him when
	he left some of the wood as compensation for sawing. 
	</p>
	<p style="widows: 2; orphans: 2; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
	<br />

	</p>
	<p style="widows: 2; orphans: 2; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
	After
	that, Dad would get out his splitting axe, and a couple of steel
	wedges for the difficult blocks. He would split all the blocks
	larger than about 3 inches in diameter and throw them in a neat pile
	shaped like an igloo to season during the summer. In the fall he
	would wheelbarrow the dry wood into the woodshed and rank it, all
	the way up to the ceiling, where it would be protected from the
	winter snow and ice, and where it was close to the house. And after
	the snow fell, the horses would be harnessed again and we would go
	to the woods to cut the next season's fuel supply.

	Beside
	each stove in the house there was a wood box. Ivan and I were
	expected to keep them filled.
