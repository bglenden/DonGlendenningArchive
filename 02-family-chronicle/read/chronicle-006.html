<p>	<span><b>CHRISTMAS ISSUE – 1998</b></span></p>
<p><span><b></b></span><br></p>
<p><span></span>I<span>=</span>ve decided to make this my Christmas letter and, in it, to record, as best I can remember, some Christmas events and activities.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Memory plays tricks and so, the events and the dates my not be exactly as described by me or remembered by someone else.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Notes are written in the order that I recall them, not necessarily in the order in which they occurred.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In doing this, it is my hope that it will spark discussion about your own Christmas memories. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>The Little Birdie</b><b></b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>As Christmas drew near, Mother had a favourite way of getting our attention and getting us to settle down.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She would say, <span>A</span>There<span>=</span>s one of Santa<span>=</span>s birdies.<span>@</span><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Obviously, the birdie was checking to see if we were being good.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The birdie flitted up to or past the window.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>By the time I turned to look, it was gone.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I never saw the birdie but Mother frequently did.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As I recall, it was only seen<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>during the evening or night.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That<span>=</span>s probably when the children got restless.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>The Pantry</b><b></b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>By the end of Christmas Day, the apples, oranges, nuts and candy would have been finished off.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Usually, on Christmas night some of the family not living at home would drop in.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Sometimes cousins would land along also.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Magically, extra goodies appeared during their visit.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was only as I got older that I realized that the supply of goodies as kept in a drawer in the pantry.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Stockings</b><b></b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I do not remember much about what was in our stockings except that there was always an orange stuck in the toe.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There were usually some candy and nuts as well and, as I recall, a few shiny pennies or maybe a nickel.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I really cannot remember getting gifts from Santa.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>One Christmas, Walter was supposed to have found a turnip in his stocking because he had not been a good boy.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Sadness at Christmas</b><b></b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Not all Christmas recollections are happy ones.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Three sad ones come quickly to mind.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>One Christmas Eve, 1948, Mum received a phone call saying that Uncle Chip had died suddenly.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He had gone over town (Bathurst) to do some last minute shopping and took a heart attack.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I believe that he died in the drug store.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Sterl Williston had a new car and Norman arranged for Sterl to take us to the funeral in Bathurst.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We couldn<span>=</span>t have had a vehicle then.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>On December 23 1969, Earl Taylor was struck by a car and killed in front of his home.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He was coming home from work and carrying a Christmas turkey.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>On December 20 ,1994, Gerald and Elaine Taylor were killed in a car accident near Bathurst.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They were making a pre-Christmas visit to Elaine<span>=</span>s family.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Gifts</b><b></b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>One Christmas, I received a <span>A</span>caterpillar<span>@</span> tractor as a gift.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It had a key to wind it up and then it would crawl around.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I remember taking it up to my bed and letting it crawl over the bed clothes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This may well have come from Grace and Roy, but I do not recall.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Another year, the Walkers, where Lillian worked, sent a train set with an oval shaped track.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was self propelled with a key to wind the spring.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Christmas Eve</b><b></b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I remember going out to the clothes line to help Mum bring in clothes one clear, cold frosty Christmas Eve.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Norman was in town and came home shortly after on the bus.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Running Water</b><b></b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>As I recall, we got electric power in the fall of 1948.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I seem to recall that Norman bought a pump and installed cold water at Christmas 1948 and hot water at Christmas, 1949.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Florida</b><b></b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>John and Mary bought a new Buick in 1958.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In a visit to Moncton, probably in November, John suggested that we go with them to Florida over Christmas.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I got an extra week off and John, Mary, Margaret, Jeannie, Carol and I drove to Florida.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>A Home-grown Meal</b><b></b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Carol and I spent Christmas 1958 at the Branch.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We had bought a huge turkey.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was so large that Mum stayed up all night to tend the fire so that it would be cooked in time for dinner.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Our Christmas meal was entirely of hone grown food. Mmmm-good.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>A Christmas Visitor</b><b></b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>When Ken came home for Christmas, I think that it was the first year he was in the service, he brought another airman home with him.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This fellow came from the South-eastern part of British Columbia (Near the Alberta border).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Apparently scalloped oysters were a Christmas tradition at his home so Mum made scalloped oysters for him.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>1957</b><b></b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Carol was anxious to see me again so I decided to spend Christmas in Stamford, Conn.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>where she was.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Gerald Taylor drove to Boston and stayed at Grace<span>=</span>s. I went to Stamford and between Christmas and New Years, came back to Boston for a couple of days.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That was the Christmas I gave Carol the diamond.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>I wish all readers a very Merry Christmas and a healthy and Happy New 1999.</b><b></b></p>
