	<p align="justify">The
	Miramichi Press of December 21, 1977 carried the following:</p>
	<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
	<p align="justify"><i>FUNERAL
	IN BLACK RIVER BRIDGE</i></p>
	<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
	<p align="justify"><i>The
	funeral service for Mrs. Janet M. Godfrey, widow of John R. Godfrey
	of Black River Bridge, was conducted at her home Dec. 10 at 2 p.m.</i></p>
	<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
	<p align="justify"><i>Rev.
	J. Posno conducted the service.  The organist, Mrs. Cameron Russell,
	played two hymns, “The Lord is My Shepherd” and “Safe in the
	Arms of Jesus.”  “Amazing Grace” was sung by a quartet.</i></p>
	<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
	<p align="justify"><i>The
	honourary pallbearers were Rankine MacLean, George Adams, Sr., J.D.
	MacRae, Elliott Cail, John A. Godfrey and Kenneth Cameron.</i></p>
	<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
	<p align="justify"><i>Active
	pallbearers were Alexander Newton, Donald Newton, Norman Newton,
	Winfield Murdock, Austin Godfrey and Neil Watling.</i></p>
	<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
	<p align="justify"><i>The
	body was placed in the Black River Bridge Memorial Vault to await
	interment in the spring.</i></p>
	<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
	<p align="justify"><i>Born
	at Black River Bridge, she was the daughter of the late Jubal and
	Grace M. (MacDonald) Watling.  She was a member of St. Paul’s
	Presbyterian Church, Black River Bridge, a life member of John
	Robertson WMS, a former member of the Presbyterian Women’s League,
	a former member of the Women’s Institute, and she took a very
	active part in all church affairs.</i></p>

	<p align="justify" style="widows: 0; orphans: 0">Horsefeathers</p>
	<p align="justify" style="widows: 0; orphans: 0">&nbsp;</p>
	<p align="justify" style="widows: 0; orphans: 0">This
	expression was quite common in polite society but is seldom heard
	anymore.  Even horse%*#* has become too mild an expression to
	express unbelief.  
	</p>
	<p align="justify" style="widows: 0; orphans: 0">&nbsp;</p>
	<p align="justify" style="widows: 0; orphans: 0">Horsefeathers
	is, or was, also a building product.  Following WW2 a product, known
	as brick siding, came on the market.  Brick siding came in sheets
	about a foot wide and eight feet long.  The exposed surface looked
	like brick but the backing was a form of insulation – like ten
	test.  
	</p>
	<p align="justify" style="widows: 0; orphans: 0">War
	years had been good economically and many people decided to improve
	their properties by adding brick siding.  In addition to appearance,
	it provided additional insulation to old houses.  
	</p>
	<p align="justify" style="widows: 0; orphans: 0">&nbsp;</p>
	<p align="justify" style="widows: 0; orphans: 0">Before
	installing the siding, the uneven surface of cedar shingles had to
	be leveled.  This was accomplished by adding horse feathers. a thin
	strip of tapered wood nailed horizontally over the shingles.  The
	siding was then added.</p>

	<p align="justify" style="widows: 0; orphans: 0">My
	Dad liked to recite poetry and taught me to do the same.  Here is
	one poem I remember:</p>
	<p align="justify" style="widows: 0; orphans: 0">&nbsp;</p>
	<p align="justify" style="widows: 0; orphans: 0">Standing
	at the foot, boys</p>
	<p align="justify" style="widows: 0; orphans: 0">Gazing
	at the sky</p>
	<p align="justify" style="widows: 0; orphans: 0">How
	can you get up, boys</p>
	<p align="justify" style="widows: 0; orphans: 0">If
	you never try?</p>
	<p align="justify" style="widows: 0; orphans: 0">&nbsp;</p>
	<p align="justify" style="widows: 0; orphans: 0">Though
	you be discouraged</p>
	<p align="justify" style="widows: 0; orphans: 0">Never
	be downcast</p>
	<p align="justify" style="widows: 0; orphans: 0">Try
	and try again, boys</p>
	<p align="justify" style="widows: 0; orphans: 0">You’ll
	succeed at last</p>
	<p align="justify" style="widows: 0; orphans: 0">&nbsp;</p>
	<p align="justify" style="page-break-after: avoid"><b>Noon
	Chores</b></p>
	<p align="justify">&nbsp;Perhaps
	because we lived so close to the school, there were usually chores
	to be done when home for lunch.  One such chore was watering the
	cattle at noon hour in the winter.</p>
	<p align="justify">Although
	we had a water pump in the house there was none in the barn,
	therefore, one had to either carry water by the pail from the house
	to the barn or take the cattle to the brook.  Not a problem in the
	summer but winter was another story.  The only open portion of the
	brook in the winter was directly under the Miller’s Bridge.  Even
	at that, the ice built up as a result of the rising and falling tide
	in the cold weather and had to be chipped with an axe so the cows
	could climb down to the water.</p>
	<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
	<p align="justify">When
	Norm and moved to the Miramichi High school, it became my turn. 
	Usually, Mum wrote “an excuse” to the teacher so we could leave
	school about 11:00 o’clock or so to chip the ice, let out the
	cows, herd them down to the brook, wait while they drank, herd them
	back to the barn and time them up.  The task always took more time
	if they had to break a path through new and heavy snow.  Seems to me
	that one cow died as a result of falling into the icy water.</p>
