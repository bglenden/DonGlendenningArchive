	The
	above photo, from Venetia’s collection, of my father, on the left,
	(1875-1938) and his brother Frank (1875-1937) was taken in front of
	our home at Little Branch on October 12, 1935.  The front of the
	porch was always covered with vines.  In the fall, when the seedpods
	were full, we would squeeze the pods until the seeds popped out at
	our target – usually one of my siblings.</p>
	<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
	<p align="justify"><b>Uncle
	Frank and Aunt Lil Glendenning</b></p>
	<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
	<p align="justify">I
	checked with the Portland Library for an obituary.  The library
	checked and found none but found the following death notice in the
	Portland Press Herald of May 28, 1937, p. 30:</p>
	<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
	<p align="justify"><i>&quot;GLENDENNING--In
	Portland, May 25, John F. Glendenning.  Aged 60 years.  Funeral
	services Friday afternoon at 3:30 o'clock from Wilde Memorial
	Chapel, Evergreen Cemetery.  Interment in Evergreen Cemetery.&quot;</i></p>
	<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
	<p align="justify">Ken
	remembers the phone call telling that Uncle Frank had died.  Uncle
	Frank worked, I believe, as yard foreman for the Grand Trunk
	Railways and, in fact, 
	</p>
	<p align="justify">died
	at work.  Apparently he worked from a small building in the train
	yard and always stepped outside and waved to each passing crew.  One
	day he did not appear and on investigation they found him dead.</p>
	<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
	<p align="justify">Based
	on the above death notice, I phoned Evergreen Cemetery, and learned
	Aunt Lil’s death date (1874-1967).  
	</p>
	<p align="justify"> 
	</p>
	<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal">I
	also learned that that their daughter, Bertha, (1905-1974) and her
	husband Clayton Crocker (- 1975) are also buried in Evergreen
	Cemetery as is Uncle Frank’s granddaughter, Joan Crocker,
	(1932-1994).  
	</p>
	<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal">&nbsp;</p>
	<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal">Aunt
	Lil lived with the Crockers after Uncle Frank died and Mum sometimes
	visited when traveling to Boston to visit Grace.  Mum enjoyed Aunt
	Lil and spoke highly of Joan.  A number of years ago while passing
	through Portland, I spoke on the phone with Joan.  She was retired,
	had winterized the old family cottage at Sebago Lake and was living
	there. Joan’s brother, Frank, was married and lived in the
	Carolinas.  
	</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p style="page-break-after: avoid"><b>Black
	River Roads</b></p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>A
	recent item in my local paper reminded me of the roads in Black
	river when the frost came out.  I am sure that we can all tell our
	favourite stories.  
	</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>Of
	course, prior to WW2, the roads were not paved and not even well
	graveled.  That is understandable since most of the work was done by
	hand and with horses and wagons.  Gravel had to be loaded onto
	wagons by hand and hauled by horse and wagon from the nearest pit. 
	This could be a distance of a mile or more.  I always thought that
	it was quite ingenious how wagon beds were made of small poles or
	narrow planks so that, when arriving at the spot where the gravel
	was to be dumped, the poles were lifted or the plank turned on edge
	to let the gravel fall through.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>Working
	on the roads was a requirement by statute and was known as “statute
	labour” or more commonly as “stated labour”.  Each resident
	put in so many days in lieu of taxes.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>The
	only road equipment I can recall was a road scraper, which could be
	used to level gravel but also to open ditches along the side of the
	road.  Teams of horses pulled these machines.  Farmers often used a
	drag sled, sometimes known as a stone boat, with a steel blade along
	one side.  The sled was dragged along the road smoothing out some of
	the hills and hollows. But I digress.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>If
	one had to go in town or elsewhere, one usually did so early in the
	morning while the ground was frozen.  One also arranged to be back
	home by 10 or 11 o’clock before the surface thawed.  
	</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>The
	mud roads must have been hard on vehicles.  I’ve seen the school
	bus traveling in the ruts with a wave of mud moving ahead of it. 
	Sometimes one drove while straddling the ruts but one had to be
	careful not to get a front wheel in one rut and a back wheel in
	another.</p>
	<p>It
	seems to me that even in the late 1940’s there was a very bad spot
	just below the Black River Hall and someone, (the Government?)
	stationed a truck there to haul vehicles through the hole.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>Another
	bad spot I recall was on the Branch Road near the school gate. 
	Seems to me that we got stuck there one Sunday morning on our way to
	church when Walter pulled too far to the right and the wheels of the
	car dropped into the ditch.  And of course, the Point Aux Carr road
	was notorious.  
	</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>Given
	that our place had the last phone on the NB Tel system (from there
	on it was the government phone line) in times of illness or death,
	it was not unusual for our household to be called on to relay
	messages.  I recall once taking a message up Bay du Vin River on a
	very muddy and rutted road.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>Older
	members of the family were frequently called jupon to harness the
	team and haul someone through a mud hole.  One time, George Godfrey
	got stuck with his bus on the way to Chatham.  I think that he could
	not make it up Ken’s Hill.  John went with the team and hauled the
	bus up the hill.</p>
