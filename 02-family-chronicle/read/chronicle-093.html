</p>
	<p align="justify">My
	Grandfather, Walter Glendenning, with his daughter, Margaret at a
	stone quarry in Stonehaven, near Bathurst, N.B.  I recall the stone
	quarry  when  we would visit relatives in the area.  As I recall,
	some relatives owned the stone quarry.  The quarry has now been
	eroded by wind and water.</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">D.
	Ernest Watling</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">From
	a clipping – date and paper unknown:</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify"><i>&quot;The
	death of D. Ernest Watling Sr. of Manse Lane, Loggieville, occurred
	Sunday at Hotel Dieu, here, following a long illness.  He was 81. 
	Born at Black River Bridge, he was the son of the late Jubal and
	Grace (MacDonald) Watling.</i><i>

	</p>
	<p align="justify"><i>He
	attended Knox United Church, Loggieville, and was a veteran of the
	First World War, serving overseas with the 26th Battalion.  During
	the Second World War he was a security guard at CFB Chatham.  He was
	a member of the Chatham Branch</i></p>
	<p align="justify"> <i>Royal
	Canadian Legion.  For a number of years the family resided in
	Niagara Falls and, following their return to the Miramichi, he
	worked for W S Loggie Company Limited here until his retirement some
	years ago.</i></p>
	<p align="justify"><i>He
	is survived by his wife, the former Alice MacLean of Black River
	Bridge; one daughter, Mrs. Everett Wishart (Joyce) of Bathurst;

	<h2>Mrs. S. A. Watling</h2>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify"><i>LOGGIEVILLE
	(Special) - Mrs. S. Alice Watling, 91, widow of D.Ernest Watling,
	died Wednesday at the Hotel Dieu Hospital, Chatham, following a
	brief illness.</i></p>
	<p align="justify"><i>Born

	two sons, Clifton (Kip) of Campbelton, and Gilbert (Gib) of
	Newcastle; a brother James of Hopedale, Mass.; 16 grandchildren; 17
	great- grandchildren; and several nieces and nephews.</i></p>
	<p align="justify"><i>The

	held Wednesday at 2 p.m. at Knox United Church, Loggieville.
	Interment will be in Black River cemetery.</i></p>
	<h1 align="justify"></h1>
	<h1 align="justify">Tasting
	Gas</h1>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">I mean siphoning gas not smelling
	it.  We always seemed to have a 45-gallon drum of gasoline around
	our place.  It was used when sawing wood, threshing, in the old
	truck or just for cleaning greasy hands or parts of machinery.  Gas
	for the farm was at a reduced cost and had a dye it; otherwise one
	purchased gas from a retailer.  There was a stiff fine for using
	tractor gas when driving for pleasure. 
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">One transferred gasoline from the
	barrel by a pump, by replacing the small bung with a spigot, or by
	siphoning.  Sometimes one had to siphon gasoline from the gas tank
	of the truck.</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">To siphon, one used a piece of
	hose, pushed it down into the barrel thus filling the hose with
	gasoline.  While holding a thumb over the end of the hose, one
	quickly pulled the hose dropping the end into the smaller container.
	 Then one removed one’s thumb.  With luck, the gasoline flowed
	from the barrel to the container.  When finished, put your thumb
	over the end of the hose to stop the flow of liquid, and raise the
	hose until the end is above the level of the gasoline in the barrel.
	 
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">An alternative was to put one end
	of the hose into the barrel, put your mouth to the other end and
	suck thereby removing the air and drawing up the liquid - just like
	drinking through a straw.  When the gas reached your mouth, one
	dropped the end of the hose into the can and let the gasoline run
	until the can is filled.  In the process, one sometimes ended up
	with a mouthful of gasoline.</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<h3>Ethnicity</h3>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">I’ve
	been asked about my ethnicity.  I am not quite sure how to calculate
	it.  As best I can determine, my Great Grandparents were:</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<h4>Ancestry	Number	%</h4>
	<p align="justify">Scottish	
	8		50</p>
	<p align="justify">English	
	2		12.5</p>
	<p align="justify">Irish		
	6		37.5</p>
	<p align="justify"><u>Total</u>		<u>16</u>		<u>100</u></p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">The
	percentages may change if one used earlier generations.
