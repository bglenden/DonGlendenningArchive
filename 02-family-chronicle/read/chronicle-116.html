<div class="reader-summary">Three interconnected essays. First: detailed recollection of potato planting techniques using horse-drawn machinery, featuring photograph of Glendenning family members (Margaret Gibson, John, Walter, Norman) circa 1952. Second: social history of women&#x27;s aprons as multipurpose domestic garment and cultural marker, touching on his mother&#x27;s daily routine and Aunt Janet. Third: brief tribute to William Roland Weeks, DFC, a local WWII fighter pilot from Loggieville who shot Field Marshal Rommel and earned the Distinguished Flying Cross for destroying 63 vehicles and 11 locomotives. Don&#x27;s awareness of local wartime heroism enriches community context.</div>

	I
	know that potatoes were once planted and covered by hand with a
	gasperaux between the potatoes for fertilizer; later potatoes were
	dropped in by hand and ploughed under.  In my time, however, we had
	a one-row horse drawn potato planter.  Brother Norman believes that
	the one shown above was not ours but actually belonged to George
	Dutcher.

	<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
	were
	cut into seeds so that each piece of potato had at least two eyes.
	Lime was sprinkled over the potatoes to protect them for a few days
	while waiting to be planted.</p>

	Potato
	planters had two hoppers – one to hold the potatoes and the other
	to hold the fertilizer.  In the photo above, Walter is sitting on
	the fertilizer hopper.  The planter automatically opened a small
	trench into which fertilizer flowed followed by potato seeds spaced
	about 6-8 inches apart.  A set of disks formed a hill over the seeds</p>

	Mother
	wore an apron around the house as did most women of the community. 
	It was the custom of the day.  Mother’s was a bib apron, she
	slipped it over her head and tied it at the back and it covered the
	entire front of her dress.  She put it on first thing in the morning
	and did not remove it until the day’s work was done – and that
	was just before bedtime.</p>
	<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
	<br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
	Aprons
	protected her dress from the “clean dirt’ of cooking and
	cleaning; it was also a convenient place to wipe one’s hands.  It
	could be quickly removed to show a clean dress if company arrived
	unexpectedly – which it often did.  It might also be used for a
	quick swipe over a dusty table.

	<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
	But
	the corner of an apron also doubled as a pot holder when removing a
	pan from the top of the stove or from the oven.    A clean apron
	could be used to clean the buttermilk from your glasses.

	One
	of my memories of Aunt Janet is of her out in the yard picking up
	dry chips for the kitchen stove and holding them in her turned up
	apron.  In Aunt Janet’s case, gathering chips was sometimes to
	divert attention from the fact that she was actually returning from
	the privy.</p>

	</p>
	<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
	Aprons
	could also be used to carry a few ripe apples from the transparent
	apple tree, bringing peas or beans from the garden or even to carry
	the eggs collected from the henhouse.  I’m sure readers have some
	additional memories.</p>

	Bill
	Weeks, son of Ellery and Eva (Daley) Weeks died in Loggieville
	recently; he served as a fighter pilot during WW2 and was awarded
	the Distinguished Flying Cross for his efforts including dive
	bombing, sorties and attacks against ground targets.  In addition he
	destroyed 63 vehicles and 11 locomotives, an ammunition train, a
	miniature submarine and at least one enemy aircraft.  Military
	records, declassified after the wa, show that Bill’s Spitfire, IX,
	Y2D (MK416) shot and wounded Field Marshall Rommel near Caen, France
	on July 17, 1944.  A camera mounted on his spitfire recorded the
	incident.</p>
