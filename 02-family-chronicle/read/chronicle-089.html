	<p align="justify">I
	have fond memories, but cannot tell you why, of the lowly dumpcart -
	the workhorse of a small farm.  It was used for hauling gravel,
	banking, turnips, manure, firewood, etc, etc, etc. – and of
	course, people.  As the name says, it was a cart that dumped; while
	loading was difficult, unloading was easy.</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">One
	sat at the front with one’s feet resting on a shaft along the side
	of the horse.  The horse’s rump was only a few 
	</p>
	<p align="justify">inches
	from the cart box.  A cart was a bit heavy to lift when hitching a
	horse but much easier to back up than a wagon.  To unload, one
	simply undid a latch at the front and lifted; gravity did the rest. 
	I especially remember using a dump cart when harvesting turnips
	(before we had a small truck).  The horse walked between two rows of
	turnips, and the cart straddled them.  One pulled a turnip, cleaned
	and topped it and threw it into the cart.  
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">When
	the cart was full, one drove to the house.  If the turnips were
	destined for the basement, they had to be unloaded one by one and
	dropped down the chute.  If unloaded on the barn floor, the cart
	could simply be dumped.</p>

	<p align="justify">“<i>Interestingly,
	the Bay du Vin is described as the &quot;windy river,&quot; after
	the notion it is not named after wine, since no grapes grew there,
	and that the name comes from </i><em><span style="font-style: normal">Baie
	des Ventes</span></em><i>,
	Bay of Winds. However, a very early map (reproduced in Ganong)
	identifies the area as </i><em><span style="font-style: normal">Baie
	des Ovines</span></em><i>
	or Sheep Bay. I think this last is the more likely origin of what we
	call Bay du Vin. </i>

	<p align="justify"><i>Reading
	about the knitting reminded me that one winter in the one room
	schoolhouse in Upper Black River the entire school (about twelve of
	us) knitted for the troops.&nbsp; I was very young, so I was
	assigned writers.&nbsp; I remember receiving a letter from a soldier
	overseas who wrote that I was helping win the war.&nbsp; In was very
	proud of our knitting efforts.&nbsp;</i></p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify"><i>I
	think I can remember many of my fellow students, including Joyce and
	Fraser MacKay, Vera and Marvin MacLean, Esther and Sybil Watling,
	Earl MacNaughton, Eldon, Hazel, and&nbsp;Ruby MacDonald, and my
	sister, Elspeth.&nbsp; I welcome additions and corrections.”</i></p>

	<p align="justify"><b>My
	sister, Lillian, recalled:</b></p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">-
	She and Brydone paid $5.00 a month for an apartment and $10.00 per
	month for a three-bedroom house in Loggieville when first married
	(1939).  
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">-
	Eggs were 10 cents per dozen, butter 15 cents per pound, fresh
	smelts were 2-4 cents per pound, sugar was 5 cents per pound and
	letters took a three-cent stamp.</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">-
	Bread poultices, or poultices of yellow soap and white sugar, were
	used to hold heat to a small infection, an onion was often placed on
	the ear when one had an ear ache, oats in a bag would be heated and
	applied to sore spots.</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">-
	One time a cyclone lifted the Upper Black River School and moved it
	across the road.  (I remember seeing photos of damage to the school,
	presumably from that cyclone. – Ed.)</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p>- Grandma Watling made yeast (for bread, not
	beer) from hops which grew at the end of our house</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">-George
	Godfrey’s barn was demolished by a cyclone about 1932</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">-
	On her way home one year Lillian stayed in a bed and breakfast in
	Maine for $1.50 for the night including breakfast.</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">-
	People gave their Eaton’s orders to the bus driver going to
	Moncton and picked up their orders from him on his return.</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">-
	Her train fare to Boston in 1933 was $11.11</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">-
	She paid $10.00 fare and $3.00 for a stateroom on a trip home by
	steamship from Boston to Saint John.</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">-
	Mum cored and sliced apples and dried them for the winter.  (I
	remember strings of cored apples strung around an upstairs bedroom,
	the one next to the driveway – Ed.)</p>
