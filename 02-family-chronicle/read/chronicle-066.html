	</p>
	<p>I
	am grateful to Donald Edge for <i><b>The
	Miramichi Fire Song</b></i>
	which was collected from Jean MacDonald in 1953 by Dr. Helen
	Creighton in <u>Maritime
	Folksongs<br />
</u><br />
<i>It
	is the truth what I now tell you <br />
For my eyes did partly
	see<br />
What did happen to the people<br />
On the banks of the
	Miramichi;<br />
What did happen to the people<br />
On the banks of
	the Miramichi.<br />
<br />
On the seventeenth evening of
	October<br />
Eighteen hundred and twenty-five<br />
Thousands of
	people fell by fire<br />
Scorched were those that did survive<br />
<br />
Some
	said it was the sins of the people<br />
And their sins rolled
	mountains high;<br />
Which did ascend up to Jehovah<br />
He would
	see and justify.<br />
<br />
In order to destroy our lumber<br />
And
	our country to distress<br />
He sent the fire in a whirlwind<br />
From
	the howling wilderness.<br />
<br />
First on the Nor' West was
	discovered<br />
Twenty-two there then did die,<br />
After it had
	swept o'er the meadows<br />
To Newcastle it did fly.<br />
<br />
While
	the people were a-sleeping<br />
Fire seized upon their town,<br />
Fine
	and handsome were their dwellings<br />
Soon they tumbled to the
	ground.<br />
<br />
</i><br />

	</p>
	<p><i>It
	burned three ships that were a-building<br />
And two more at anchor
	lay,<br />
Many that had seen the fire<br />
Thought it was the
	judgement day.<br />
<br />
Twelve more men were burned by the fire<br />
In
	the compass of that town,<br />
Twenty-five more on the water<br />
In
	a scow upset and drowned.<br />
<br />
A family below Newcastle<br />
Were
	destroyed among the rest,<br />
Father, Mother and three
	children,<br />
One an infant at the breast.<br />
<br />
Thirteen
	families were residing<br />
Just out back of Gretna Green,<br />
All
	of them were burnt by the fire,<br />
Only one alive was seen.<br />
<br />
Then
	it passed to Black River,<br />
Wher it did burn sixty more<br />
So
	it forced it's way with fury<br />
Till it reached the briny
	shore.<br />
<br />
Forty-two miles by one-hundred<br />
This great
	fire did extend;<br />
All was done within eight hours<br />
Not
	exceeding over ten,<br />
<br />
As I have spoke of things
	collective<br />
Now I intend to personate<br />
And speak of some of
	my aqquaintence<br />
Of whom I was intimate.<br />
<br />
A lady was
	drove to the water,<br />
Wher she stood both wet and
	cold,<br />
Notwhithstanding her late illnes,<br />
She had a babe but
	three days old.<br />
<br />
Six young men, both smart and
	active,<br />
Were to work on the Nor' West,<br />
When they saw the
	fire coming,<br />
To escape it tried their best.<br />
<br />
About
	two miles from where their camp stood<br />
They were found each one
	of them<br />
But to paint their sad appearance<br />
I cannot do with
	pen.<br />
<br />
To see these fine, these blooming youngmen<br />
All
	lay dead upon the ground<br />
And their brothers standing
	mourning<br />
Spread a dismal scene around.<br />
<br />
Then we dug a
	grave and buried<br />
Those whom the fire did burn<br />
Then each of
	us that are living<br />
To our dwellings did return.<br />
<br />
I
	heard the sighs, the cries and groaning<br />
Saw the falling of the
	tears<br />
By me this will not be forgotten<br />
Should I live a
	hundred years.<br />
<br />
Sisters weeping for their brothers,<br />
Father
	crying for his son,<br />
And with bitter, heartfelt sorrow,<br />
Said
	the Mother, &quot;I'm undone!&quot;<br />
<br />
It killed the wild
	beasts in the forests<br />
In the rivers many fish<br />
Such another
	horrid fire<br />
See again I do not wish.</i><br />
<br />
The
	poem was written, I believe, by John Jardine.  Can any reader tell
	us more about the author? The year? Whether the fire swept through
	“our” Black River? If so, who were the people who were killed?</p>

	<p>I would like to publish photos of the early
	school busses.  As I recall, the original was a dark blue bus built
	for and operated by the MacK and George Godfrey.  Was the body built
	locally?  Perhaps the inside was built by Edgar and Bill Fowlie? The
	next was a commercially available bus – blue and silver.  (I still
	remember getting into that bus on the first morning.)  Then Tom
	Adams had the contract and his buses were green with yellow trim. 
	(See photo.).  If anyone has photos, I would be delighted to include
	them in an up coming issue.</p>

	<p>Photo
	of Adams’ School bus taken at gate to Little Branch School</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>If one missed the
	school bus, one ended up walking the three miles to the Miramichi
	Rural High School (No longer exists.)  Once I missed the bus and,
	naturally, was late for class.  Just inside the door, I met the
	School Principal, Mr. Perley Quayle.  I quipped, “Better late than
	never”.  He responded ,  “Yes, but better never late”</p>
