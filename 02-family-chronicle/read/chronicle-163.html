	“<i>It is New Year's Eve,
	1852 and John Smith sits at his desk&nbsp;by candlelight. He dips
	his quill pen in ink and begins to writes&nbsp;his New Year's
	resolutions:<br />
<br />
 **********************************<br />
1.&nbsp;
	No man is&nbsp;truly well-educated unless he learns to spell his
	name at least three&nbsp;different ways within the same document.&nbsp;
	I resolve to give &gt;&gt; the appearance of being extremely
	well-educated in the coming&nbsp;year.<br />
2.&nbsp; I resolve to
	see to it that all of my children will&nbsp;have the same names that
	my ancestors have used for six generations in&nbsp;a row.<br />
3.&nbsp;
	My age is no one's business but my own.&nbsp; I&nbsp;hereby resolve
	to never list the same age or birth year twice on any&nbsp;document.<br />
4.&nbsp;
	I resolve to have each of my children baptized in a&nbsp;different
	church -- either in a different faith or in a different&nbsp;parish.&nbsp;&nbsp;
	Every third child will not be baptized at all, or will be baptized
	by an itinerant minister who keeps no records.<br />
5.&nbsp; I
	resolve to move&nbsp;to a new town, new county, or new state at
	least once every 10 years -- just&nbsp;before those pesky
	enumerators come around asking silly&nbsp;questions.<br />
6.&nbsp; I
	will make every attempt to reside in counties and&nbsp;towns where
	no vital records are maintained or where the courthouse burns&nbsp;down
	every few years.<br />
7.&nbsp; I resolve to join an obscure
	religious&nbsp;cult that does not believe in record keeping or in
	participating in military&nbsp;service.<br />
8.&nbsp; When the tax
	collector comes to my door, I'll loan him&nbsp;my pen, which has
	been dipped in rapidly fading blue ink.<br />
9.&nbsp; I&nbsp;resolve
	that if my beloved wife Mary should die, I will marry
	another&nbsp;Mary.<br />
10.&nbsp; I resolve not to make a will.&nbsp;
	Who needs to spend&nbsp;money on a lawyer?<br />
11.&nbsp; I resolve
	to not clutter up the good&nbsp;farm pasture with headstones that
	will just get broken or fade with time&nbsp;anyway.<br />
12.&nbsp; I
	resolve to protect my family and friends privacy,&nbsp;by giving
	false names and places for events.<br />
13.&nbsp; I resolve to&nbsp;never
	give the correct accounts of misdeeds in the family, so when Uncle
	Lem&nbsp;shot that fellow and was tried&nbsp;for murder, my children
	will be told he stole a cow.<br />
14.&nbsp;&nbsp; I resolve to never
	trim the family cemetery of brush and tangle weed, to keep&nbsp;out
	any one doing that silly Genealogical work.<br />
15.&nbsp; I resolve
	to&nbsp;always alternate my child's and wife's first and middle
	names when the census&nbsp;taker comes around, just to give him
	practice with his&nbsp;spelling.<br />
16.&nbsp; I resolve to come
	from Ireland (where there are no&nbsp;records, or, if there are,
	they can only be examined by visiting the&nbsp;exact village and,
	<br />
&gt;&gt; pleading with the local clergy, (who is hostile to
	anyone&nbsp;not of his belief, which of course you are) and/or
	handing over a&nbsp;fee equal to or exceeding your yearly income for
	one hour's research which&nbsp;may not <br />
find anything.)<br />
17.&nbsp;
	I resolve that not only shall I NOT die&nbsp;in my country of birth,
	nor shall my children (yea verily) unto the sixth&nbsp;generation.<br />
18.&nbsp;
	I resolve that I shall call my children by odd&nbsp;names which the
	enumerator shall spell incorrectly.<br />
19.&nbsp; I&nbsp;resolve
	that I shall be absent on the night of the census.<br />
20.&nbsp;
	I&nbsp;resolve that if unable to be absent on census night I shall
	endeavor to be&nbsp;enumerated twice.<br />
21.&nbsp; I resolve that
	when I die my children/wife&nbsp;are instructed to give the wrong
	details for my death&nbsp;certificate.<br />
22.&nbsp; I resolve that
	I and most of my family shall die&nbsp;suddenly just before death
	certifications started to be used, in a parish&nbsp;where easy
	access to the records ceased the previous&nbsp;year.<br />

	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">During
	a conversation in the Miramichi last week, mention was made of
	“skinning a pig.”  It was new to me.  In my time, when one
	butchered a pig one scalded the carcass and scraped off the
	bristles; the hot water loosened the bristles.  I am told that
	practice is no longer used.  Now one skins a pig in much the same
	way as one skins a calf.  That, I hope to see some day.  On the
	other hand, perhaps someone was pulling my leg.</p>
