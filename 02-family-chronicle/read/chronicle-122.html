	<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
	Shantymen
	visited forestry workers and fishermen, and probably others such as
	sailors and trappers bring Christianity (or was it religion?) to
	folk who lived in isolated areas.  I do not recall them ever being
	to Black River but I recall mention of them.  It may well have been
	that either Mother or one of her church organizations contributed to
	the cause from time to time.</p>

	If
	you are a senior, you may have been a “Lux Daily Dipper.”  As I
	recall, the term was a part of a promotion of Lux soap flakes and
	applied, as I recall, to ladies who dipped their undies daily in
	Lux.

	<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
	Speaking
	of soap, mention was made at our recent family reunion of “Surprise
	Soap”.  As I recall it was an amber coloured translucent hand
	Soap.  Was Sunlight Soap similar?  Then there was carbolic soap,
	Lifebuoy (was it a deep pink or orange in colour?), Naptha which
	didn’t seem to stay around very long, and for really dirty hands,
	there was lava soap which contained pumice which is the fine ask
	from a volcano.  (Pumice was, and perhaps still is, used for
	smoothing the finishes of fine furniture.)</p>

	I
	was with a group a few nights ago, that was reminiscing about radio
	programs.  Here are a few I recall or that were mentioned:  Gabriel
	Heater and the news (WOR); the Lone Ranger, Amos and Andy, the Green
	Hornet, WWVA Wheeling, West Virginia for country music; the Maritime
	Gardener, Gillette Friday night Boxing; Don Messer and the
	Islanders; Dagwood and Blondie (or in the words of a neighbour,
	(Deadwood and Baldy); Fibber McGee and Molly.</p>

	<b>My

	<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
	My
	father made a rocking horse; I cannot remember if it was made for me
	or handed down.  It would be considered large enough for two
	youngsters although I cannot remember of two using it at the same
	time.  Presumably the wood was cut on the farm as was the case for
	most of the construction at our place.  I do not recall the type of
	wood used for the rockers but the remainder was made of white pine
	and not painted.</p>

	Two
	home-made arm chairs sat in our kitchen; both made by my father. The
	larger one was for my father and the smaller one for Mother.  I
	think that they were framed with hardwood, probably ash, but I
	cannot remember for sure.</p>

	<br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
	The
	back of the chair was slanted for comfort.  The seats and backs were
	made of rope in a basket weave pattern.  The seat also had a cushion
	– probably one filled with feathers but I cannot really recall. 
	They were made by hand and the wood was cut on the farm.</p>
