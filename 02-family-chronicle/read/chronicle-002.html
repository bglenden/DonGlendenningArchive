<div class="reader-summary">Second Family Chronicle (November 4, 1997) explores ancestral origins and family connections. Don notes a discrepancy regarding his Great-Grandmother—he believes it was Elspeth Jardine (not Elizabeth). Includes a 1991 Scot&#x27;s Magazine letter from Denis Glendining about ancestors and historical records. Provides earliest documented family dates and discusses how many generations removed Don is from various ancestral lines (6th generation Glendenning, 5th generation Watling/MacDonald/MacAskill/MacNaughton/Leach/Rae, etc.). Fascinating section on &quot;Wanderers&quot; describing how many Glendennings and Watlings emigrated to Portland, Maine and other US locations in the early 1900s, including Don&#x27;s parents&#x27; journey. Vividly describes Jane Watling (Don&#x27;s mother) arriving in Portland January 24, 1908—the day Portland City Hall burned.</div>

<p><span></span><b>Jardine Connection</b><b></b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>There is a discrepancy between my information and that found in the recent Jardine history.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I believe that my Great Grandmother was Elspeth Jardine who married John MacDonald; the Jardine family history shows Elizabeth Jardine married to John MacDonald.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I would appreciate help in sorting this out.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Scots Magazine</b><b></b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>A friend of mine gave me a clipping, actually a letter to the editor, from the Scot=s Magazine from 1991.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It reads as follows:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><i>Villa d=Este 4,</i></p>
<p><i>50 Park Drive</i></p>
<p><i>Port Elizabeth 6001</i></p>
<p><i>RSA</i><i></i></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Dear Sir,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>One of my ancestors, Simon Glendoning, fought at Bannockburn, and his sword is known to have been in Parton,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Kirkcudbrightshire, as late as 1809 when my great-grandfather, William Glendonwyn, a sea captain, died.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He was succeeded by his daughter, Xaveria, who died unmarried in 1858.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Her successor was Frederick Scott who married a Miss Cameron.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>These two adopted the name Glendonwyn. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Can anyone help me trace the burial places of the Glendonwyn/Glendoning/Glendining family ?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Also, where is the sword now ?</p>
<p>Denis Glendining</p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Earliest dates</b><b></b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The only dates prior to 1800 in my family tree notes are as follows:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>1775 - 1843 	Alexander Macdonald</p>
<p>1781 - 1874 	Grace MacAskill</p>
<p>1772 - 		John Glendinning</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>We have lots of information to gather yet.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>How many generations ?</b><b></b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The records which I now have show me as a:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>- 6th generation Glendenning</p>
<p>- 5th generation MacAskill</p>
<p>- 5th generation Watling</p>
<p>- 5th generation MacDonald</p>
<p>- 5th generation MacNaughton</p>
<p>- 5<sup>th</sup> generation Leach</p>
<p>- 5<sup>th</sup> generation Rae</p>
<p>- 4<sup>th</sup> generation Jardine</p>
<p>- 4<sup>th</sup> generation Harley</p>
<p>- 4<sup>th</sup> generation Peters</p>
<p>- 4<sup>th</sup> generation Sealy<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>So, pick the family reunion you want to attend or the tartan you want to wear.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Based on the above, it looks as though the Scottish blood greatly outweighs the English and Irish blood in my veins.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Montague, PEI</b><b></b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Recently, I visited the Montague Museum. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Their collection includes a photo of three children - Harriet, Ruth and Findley Glendenning.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The photo was taken by “Montreal Studio”, and was found in a house in the Montague area.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Any ideas?</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Daley</b><b></b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Walter Glendenning was asking about our connection to Hart Daley.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>According to Joy (Glendenning) Winton, Hart, James and Wilfred were brothers.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Their father was John Daley who was married to Susan Peters, a sister to my grandmother, Elizabeth (Peters) Glendenning.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Knowles</b><b></b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>A sister of Gramma (Peters)Glendenning, Jane, married Henry Knowles.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They had five children: Rufus, Sam, Evelyn, Lillian and Elizabeth.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I still think that there is a connection through the Harleys but have not been able to confirm it.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>“Mac” MacDonald</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>AMac MacDonald, a first cousin of my mother, was killed as a young man while working on the Newcastle (Morrissy) Bridge.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He was a brother, I believe, of Alex, Vada, Frances, Isabel and Elspeth.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Was Mac a nickname?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Was his name really Hugh?</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Origin of Names</b><b></b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Until about 1000 AD, most people in Europe had only one name. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Later, to distinguish one person from another, a second name was added.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The second name was usually taken from the person’s occupation, location, father’s name or some other characteristic.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Sandra Devlin, who writes a regular column on genealogy, provides the following: Brewster one who makes beer, Clarke from clerk, Cooper one who made hoops for barrels, Roper was a rope or netmaker, Travers was a toll bridge collector, etc.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The Glendinning is believed to be locational in nature and probably means “one who came from the hidden dale”.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Glen is a common prefix and signifies a narrow valley bounding a river or stream.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>While the two most common spellings are Glendenning and Glendinning,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Glendining, Glendowyne, Glendinnin, Glendynwyning, Glendouwyne, Glendoun and Glendoning are all considered part of the same family.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Some of the oder Scottish maps still show a place called “Glendinning” about 25 miles north of Annan.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was known for its rich antimony mines.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>My Great-grandfather, who came to New Brunswick in 1830, was born at Callister Hall about 25-30 miles north of Annan.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Callister Hall still stands and is shown on some Scottish maps.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is a one story stone cottage on a rise in sheep grazing country.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Local information says it was a stage stop at one time.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I was told also that it had burned but, being stone, the damage was only to the interior and roof.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is still used as a home today.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Our Great-grandfather sailed from Annan about 25 miles from where he lived.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>At one time Annan was a busy seaport but now the mouth of the river is heavily silted.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Wanderers</b><b></b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>One is struck by the fact that the Glendennings and Watlings, especially of my mother’s and father’s generation, were great travellers.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As with so many Maritimers, they found their way to the ‘Boston States”.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That generation seemed to have picked Portland as a place to work.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Among the Glendennings we know to have worked and/or lived there were Elmer, Venetia, Frank, Margaret and Ray.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Among the Watlings were George, Jack, Janet, Jim and Jane.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Also Chipman and Guy Glendenning worked in South America, Leonard Glendenning lived in or near Palerma, Maine.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Ernest Watling worked with Elmer Glendenning in Tennessee; he also worked for a while in Niagara Falls.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is likely, also, that others of the family worked away from New Brunswick.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>On the Glendenning side, Venetia (Glendenning) Doring, who was married and lived in Falmouth Foreside, near Portland, may have provided place for her brothers to stay on arrival in Portland.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We do not really know.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Jane (Watling) Glendenning’s travel dates are better known than most.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I remember her telling me that she arrived in Portland on the day that the Portland City Hall burned.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A phone call to the Portland Library revealed the date to be January 24, 1908 - just a month before her 18<sup>th</sup> birthday.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She soon became aware of, if not to know, the Glendennings because she also said that she could have gone to my Grandfather=s funeral, February 14, 1908.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She did not go but baby sat someone’s children.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Interesting to speculate about connections between the two families.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I believe that Jane stayed with her brother George when sh first arrived in Portland; George, I believe, worked for a while with Elmer Glendenning.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Then again, Mum’s brother Jim worked up in the woods with one winter with Elmer Glendenning.</p>
