	<p>Lillian
	(Glendenning) Weeks, Bobby Glendenning (Uncle Guy’s son) and Don
	Glendenning taken at Little Branch.  Believed to have been taken in
	1937 when Uncle Guy was in New Brunswick for Venetia’s wedding. 
	(As I recall, my first long pants, other than overalls, were
	purchased when my Dad died in 1938.)</p>

	16 inches for the stove.  The following comprised the crew:</p>

	<p align="justify">Another
	entry shows 43/4 hr at John’s; 43/4 at company pile and 43/4 hrs
	at own pile.  I believe this refers to some wood that John and
	Walter cut in common, perhaps on Crown land, as well as their own
	supply.</p>

	crews comprised of folk who exchange time as well as those who were
	paid.  Given the amount paid to James T. D. Watling, I wonder if he
	owned the thresher.  Although we shared ownership of a woodcutter
	with Uncle Jim, we did not have our own thresher. We also shared a
	stationary engine with Uncle Jim.  I think that we used a thresher
	owned by George Adams, Sr. who brought thresher and engine on a
	sloven.  Sometimes we used our own engine but I cannot recall who

	grandmother, Annie (Jago) Peters, came to live with us in 1963 until
	her death in 1967 at the age of 82.&nbsp; I was born and brought up
	in the Hamilton area, but benefited from the conversations of my
	mother and Granny reminiscing about ‘down home'.&nbsp; There were
	also visits to New Brunswick to see the relatives every so often.&nbsp;
	My Uncle Johnny Peters was the postman in the Canobie area, and for
	many years (late '40s to '60s) had a store and gas station&nbsp;opposite
	the Lower Canobie Road near Lombard's quarry.&nbsp; My maternal

	Season</b></p>
	<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
	<p align="justify">I
	write this having just picked and eaten the first 8 strawberries
	from my garden.  I recall the truck coming to our door loaded with
	strawberries.  Mum usually bought a pail – a dollar a pail, as I
	recall but I know, also, that she always bargained.  The
	strawberries would be hulled, put in the large, round, enameled pan
	for mixing bread and placed in the basement on the cold floor. (We
	did not have a refrigerator at the time.)  Our dessert that evening
	was strawberries and cream, usually with a little sugar.  Mmmm good.
	 Because we were a large family, a pail of strawberries could be
	gone the first evening – sometimes there were a few left for the
	next day.</p>
