</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Don and Carol visited Hampton, Virginia, where Don&#x27;s father worked as a civilian supervisor on Langley Field construction during WWI (1917-1918). Don&#x27;s parents (Grace and Walter) and siblings (Venetia, Lillian) lived on the base; their daughter Margaret is buried in St. John&#x27;s Episcopal Cemetery. Describes the establishment of NACA&#x27;s Hampton site: 1,660 acres purchased in 1916, cleared and constructed by J. G. White Engineering Corporation (carpenters earned $7/day). Don&#x27;s father held an identification badge and received a thank-you letter from the U.S. Department of Defense. His sisters kept passes to Langley Field—a significant window into Don&#x27;s father&#x27;s wartime contributions. Includes vital statistics from St. Stephen&#x27;s Church records (1910, 1913, 1915, 1922).</div>

	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Recently
	Carol and I spent a week in Virginia and, while there, visited
	Hampton where my father and mother lived in 1918.  (Their daughter,
	Margaret is buried in St. John’s Episcopal Cemetery).</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">In
	1915, the US set up a National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics
	and on December 5, 1916 the Secretary of War approved the purchase
	of 1,660 acres near Hampton, Virginia.  The property was mostly
	wooded, with some open fields and much marshland, and had direct
	access to the water for seaplane landings.  It is obvious from
	reading local histories, that there was a major push to prepare the
	field for immediate use.</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">The
	contract for clearing and construction was awarded to J. G. White
	Engineering Corporation of New York City; actual work did not get
	under way until mid-1917.  Carpenters were paid $7.00 per day. At
	the same time, work was progressing on the dredging of the Back
	River, building of rail and road links to the city, and the
	construction of the landing field. Eventually the entire project was
	taken over by the US Army with supervision provided by the civilian
	contractor.</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">The
	initial detachment of military personnel arrived in April, 1917 and
	was housed in some of the buildings on the property at time of
	purchase.  The entry of the US into WW! added new urgency to the
	project.</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">By
	1918, my father had been involved in heavy construction throughout
	the US and, not surprisingly, became a civilian supervisor  (I do
	not know at what level) at Langley field; he and the family (Grace,
	Walter, Venetia and Lillian) lived on the base.   Among Dad’s
	mementoes were his “identification badge” with White Engineering
	and a letter from the US Department of Defense thanking him for
	services rendered.  Sisters Venetia and Lillian kept their passes
	admitting them to Langley Field.</p>

	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Records
	from St. Stephen’s church for the years 1910, 1913, 1915 and 1922
	were given to me by Agnes (Gibson) Glendenning.  The vital
	statistics, births, deaths, and marriages may be of interest to
	those searching their family roots and some appear in this issue;
	others will be included in future issues.</p>
