<div class="reader-summary">Detailed first-person account of winter smelt fishing on the Miramichi (ca. 1950 photo shows Bill Taylor, Eldred and Cameron Russell). Don explains the technical operation of box nets, leaders, ice holes, toggle sticks, and the demanding work of hauling nets twice daily at tide changes. Describes the loading, freezing, and transport of smelts by sleigh. Names buyers including Uncle Jim Watling (buyer for W.S. Loggie Company, Chatham) and A &amp; R Loggie Company (Loggieville). Explains how fishermen stayed on the ice all week with horses and shanties. Notes the practice of dropping nets to the riverbed during ice runs. This is a colorful portrait of Miramichi working life and local family connections (Watling family involvement).</div>

	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><b>Above
	we see Bill Taylor (standing) with Eldred and Cameron Russell
	tending their fishing nets off the Point Aux Carr shore.  The exact
	year is unknown, however, it would be around 1950. Although my
	family did not fish, here is my under- standing of how winter smelt
	fishing with box nets worked.</b></p>

	<p style="orphans: 2; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%; widows: 2">
	Smelt fishermen on the
	Miramichi still set box nets, usually double, through the winter ice
	in the same way as they have for perhaps 100 years or more.  While
	the fishing method is the same, “Old Dobbin” has been replaced
	by snowmobiles and four wheelers.  
	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; widows: 2; orphans: 2; line-height: 100%">

	<p style="orphans: 2; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%; widows: 2">
	A box net, as the name
	suggests, is a rectangular box about 14 feet wide and fifty feet
	long; the depth varies depending on the depth of the water.  The
	mesh is slightly under an inch compared with a salmon net where the
	mesh is about five inches.</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; widows: 2; orphans: 2; line-height: 100%">
	<br />

	</p>
	<p style="orphans: 2; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%; widows: 2">
	A flat piece of netting,
	called a leader, juts out from each side of the net for a distance
	of 100 feet.  Since smelts swim against the current, the leader is
	placed across the current and helps guide fish into the net.  Fish
	come to the leader and, if they turn the right way, in attempting to
	swim around the net find themselves trapped in the “box” part of
	the net.  The net is designed for easy entrance; once inside,
	however, it is almost impossible for a smelt to swim out.  The
	entire net is placed under the ice.  
	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; widows: 2; orphans: 2; line-height: 100%">
	<br />

	</p>
	<p style="orphans: 2; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%; widows: 2">
	The photos show a slot, a
	smelt hole, in the ice up to 14 feet long and maybe 15 inches wide. 
	Smelt holes were cut using an ice saw, now a chain saw, and kept
	clear with a chisel as needed.</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; widows: 2; orphans: 2; line-height: 100%">
	The centre of the box net is
	placed directly under this hole and, anchored to toggle sticks, a
	forked stick frozen into the ice close to the smelt hole.  
	</p>
</div>
<p style="orphans: 2; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%; widows: 2">
	The outer ends of the net
	also need to be anchored.  First a small hole is cut in the ice out
	from each corner of the extended net and a toggle stick frozen
	nearby.  A rope is tied to each outer corner of the net and the
	loose end of the rope is pushed under the ice to one of the outlying
	holes with the aid of a running pole, a long slender pole usually
	made from two or more small slender trees fastened together.  The
	ropes are pulled up and tied to the toggle stick nearby.  These
	ropes are tightened to set the net and slackened when the net is
	being fished. The result is a huge box suspended under the ice with
	a leader extending about 100 feet out each side.</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; widows: 2; orphans: 2; line-height: 100%">
	<br />

	</p>
	<p style="orphans: 2; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%; widows: 2">
	Nets were usually pulled
	twice a day – at the turn of the tide.  First the wooden cover is
	removed and the new ice is cleared from the holes.  Then two of the
	ropes on the toggle sticks are slackened to allow one side of the
	net to be pulled up through the slot.  The bunt, the end of the net
	tied like the top of a potato bag, is opened and the smelts dumped
	out.  After emptying, the net is put back in the water and the ropes
	tightened.  The operation was repeated to empty the other side of
	the net.  The top photo shows the three men pulling the net.</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; widows: 2; orphans: 2; line-height: 100%">
	&nbsp;</p>
	<p style="orphans: 2; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%; widows: 2">
	On the ice beside the sled,
	the reader can see a small box perhaps 3 feet square, with handles,
	not unlike a sieve for screening pebbles from sand; the bottom is
	covered with wire. Smelts were emptied into the box and the water
	drains off.  In below zero temperatures, the fish soon freeze.  To
	keep them from freezing into one solid lump, the box is lifted and
	shaken a few times.  Two men pick up the box and tip the smelts into
	the sled.  I estimate the sled in the photo to contain about 650
	pounds of smelts.</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; widows: 2; orphans: 2; line-height: 100%">
	<br />

	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; widows: 2; orphans: 2; line-height: 100%">
	Once one sled was loaded, the
	horse would be moved ahead and another horse with an empty sled
	would take its place.</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; widows: 2; orphans: 2; line-height: 100%">
	<br />

	</p>
	<p style="orphans: 2; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%; widows: 2">
	Depending where one fished, a
	buyer would either come out on the ice or meet fishermen when they
	came ashore to purchase their smelts.</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; widows: 2; orphans: 2; line-height: 100%">
	<br />

	</p>
	<p style="orphans: 2; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%; widows: 2">
	Uncle Jim Watling was a buyer
	for the W.S. Loggie Company of Chatham; A &amp; R Loggie Company of
	Loggieville was another major buyer.  He bought from the fishermen,
	brought the smelts to his shed and spread them out on the shed floor
	to keep them frozen.  Later, Loggie’s truck would come to Uncle
	Jim’s, and to other buyers, and pick up the day’s catch.  The
	fish were taken to the company freezer, repacked and shipped to
	market, especially the US market.</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; widows: 2; orphans: 2; line-height: 100%">
	<br />

	</p>
	<p style="orphans: 2; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%; widows: 2">
	Although the above photos
	were taken close to Cameron Russell’s shore, fishermen also went
	far out into the bay to fish and stayed near their nets all week. 
	They took with them a hovel for the horse and a shanty for
	themselves, usually two men.  On Friday night or Saturday they
	lifted their nets and came home for the weekend returning again to
	the ice on Sunday evening.</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; widows: 2; orphans: 2; line-height: 100%">
	<br />

	</p>
	<p style="orphans: 2; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%; widows: 2">
	Sometimes, usually in late
	winter, the ice would run, meaning that the ice would move in the
	Bay.  In such cases, the men would drop their nets to the riverbed
	so that the nets would not be lost nor ruined by dragging across the
	ocean bottom.  Nets at the time this photo was taken were made of
	hemp/sisal/jute (I believe it was all roughly the same) and would
	sink; today’s nets would have to be weighted down.  Later when the
	ice stabilized, the fishermen would return to the spot where their
	nets were dropped, cut holes in the ice, grapple for their nets and,
	when found, start all over.</p>
