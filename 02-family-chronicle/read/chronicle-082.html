	<p><b>George Watling and Don
	Glendenning preparing for a fishing expedition to the Branch Bridge.
	 See how long and straight George’s fishing rod is, no wonder he
	caught all the trout.  No, I did not forget.  I know that this is a
	repeat photo.  </b>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify"><b>Note:</b></p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p>Normally, I do not use the newsletter to report
	on family events.  The reason for this is that, because of living
	away from the Miramichi, I am not able to keep in touch with our
	large extended family.  But, here is an exception.</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<h1 align="justify">George
	and Ruby Watling</h1>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">Recently
	we attended a fiftieth wedding anniversary for George and Ruby
	Watling.  . I had been “best man” at their wedding.  We were
	pleased to help celebrate the event and it was great to see so many
	relatives and friends. 
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">In
	thanking friends, George invited me to say a few words.  I did but
	could/should have said much more.  It seems that I am seldom at a
	loss for words except for family gatherings.  As I drove home, these
	are the words I thought that I should have said.</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">“I
	am delighted to be here to help celebrate this anniversary.  I
	remember well the original event some fifty years ago when George
	and Ruby made their marriage vows.  It was a great beginning to
	their life together.  Today is an equally but different occasion as
	we help celebrate with them their anniversary of fifty years of
	marriage.</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">I’ve
	known George for 75 years.  He was my closest neighbour, primary
	playmate and friend.  He was always just ahead of me and no matter
	how much I tried, I was never able to catch up.  He had his birthday
	in August, mine did not come until September, he was always one
	grade ahead of me through school, he went to work first, got married
	first and now celebrates his 50<sup>th</sup>
	anniversary while I must wait several more years.  At this stage of
	life, it will be hard for me to catch up.</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">I
	could recount endless stories of things we did together such as
	coasting on beautiful winter nights and seeing the northern lights
	(sometimes we broke new trails over the steepest parts of the
	hill.), clearing a rink and skating on the river (I do not remember
	playing hockey), damming the brook, digging ditches in the snow to
	channel the spring run-off, chasing our “hoops” around our yards
	and our tires laden with gravel up and down the hill, the hours on a
	Sunday afternoon climbing in the covered Branch Bridge, swimming in
	the buff at our shore, building a raft, trying to find bottom where
	the mud digger had been set up, and much, much more.  
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">I
	could tell about the time that Mrs. Harper got stuck in a snow-bank
	above our place and George and I digging her out, an episode of
	collecting for some worthy cause (or was it selling poppies?) around
	the Branch, our attempt to get transparent apples at Jim Finno’s,
	sliding down the back roof of our barn on a piece of cardboard, and
	many more. 
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">After
	we graduated, George commenced employment and soon moved from Black
	River.  Our paths crossed again in Moncton and we frequently went to
	movies or cruised Main Street, as I recall, on Saturday nights. 
	After I left Moncton, our paths diverged.  On occasion when we met,
	his interests had changed to the field of health.  I soon understood
	when I met Ruby.  They married.  They led a busy life with Ruby
	nursing and George at the CNR shops and they still do  Non-working
	hours were filled with raising a family and an active involvement in
	their church and lodge.  Then came retirement but they still kept
	busy but this time both at home and in the sunny south.</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">They
	still provide a warm welcome when I drop by in Moncton and George is
	still a source of information as I gather notes about family and
	Black River.</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">Again,
	on behalf of family and friends gathered here today. I extend
	congratulations on this very special occasion wish you many happy
	returns. ”</p>

	<h3>New
	Brunswick Currency</h3>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">According
	to the October 2004 issue of the Miramichi Branch, NBGS, Newsletter,
	the early “coin” of New Brunswick was “one pound of spring
	beaver pelts”; this was equal to 1 otter, 3 sable or marten skins,
	6 mink skins, 10 muskrat, 10 ermine, 5 pounds of deerskin, and 6
	pounds of feathers.  I beaver skin would buy 14 pounds of pork, 30
	pounds of flour, 21/2 gallons of molasses, 2 gallons of rum or 2/3
	yard of cloth.</p>

	<p align="left">Thanks
	to Tina Newton for information, which shows that, Uncle George
	Watling (1881-1958) crossed into Maine at Vanceboro in September
	1903 with Bangor as his destination.  Alfred H. MacLean of Little
	Branch was on the same train.</p>

	<p align="left"><i><b>Today the local merchant, who served overseas
	in the First Great War, showed a letter that he had received from a
	nephew, John J. Watling, with the Carleton and York Regiment in
	England.  While troops were being issued with rifles in England,
	John Watling took his as a matter or routine, but when he returned
	to his hut and examined it he was indeed surprised to note the name
	of his uncle, Lieut.  G. Max Watling, cut into the butt of the
	rifle.</b></i></p>
	<p align="left"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="left">“<i><b>With millions of guns issued to the troops,
	it was certainly amazing that John should get the gun that I used in
	the last war,” Max Watling commented.</b></i></p>
