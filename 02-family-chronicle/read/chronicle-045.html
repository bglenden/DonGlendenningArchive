<p><b><i></i></b><br></p>
<p><b><i>“What a beautiful spot,” the stranger said,</i></b></p>
<p><b><i>As he paused and reverently bared his head.</i></b></p>
<p><b><i>The golden rays of the setting sun</i></b></p>
<p><b><i>Shone on slab and shaft, where many a one</i></b></p>
<p><b><i>Now free from labour and earthly care</i></b></p>
<p><b><i>In a narrow bed lies resting there.</i></b></p>
<p><b><i></i></b><br></p>
<p><b><i>The Black River Water waters flowing peacefully by</i></b></p>
<p><b><i>Reflected the blue of the summer sky;</i></b></p>
<p><b><i>Through the leafy branches of the trees</i></b></p>
<p><b><i>Softly rustled a gentle breeze.</i></b></p>
<p><b><i>Not far away echoed sweet and long</i></b></p>
<p><b><i>The notes of the robin’s evensong.</i></b></p>
<p><b><i></i></b><br></p>
<p><b><i>Remote from the noise of the busy highway</i></b></p>
<p><b><i>This “Village of Silence” so peacefully lay;</i></b></p>
<p><b><i>The little white church stands guard nearby</i></b></p>
<p><b><i>With its spire pointing up to the sky;</i></b></p>
<p><b><i>Here when sounds the bell on the Sabbath day,</i></b></p>
<p><b><i>The people meet, to worship and pray.</i></b></p>
<p><b><i></i></b><br></p>
<p><b><i>The church of their fathers’ stood nearer the shore,</i></b></p>
<p><b><i>It has gone, like all things that are no more.</i></b></p>
<p><b><i>‘Twas the labour of those who came first to this place</i></b></p>
<p><b><i>A vigorous, God-fearing, industrious race,</i></b></p>
<p><b><i>To build homes and wrest a living from the soil was their goal</i></b></p>
<p><b><i>Yet they did not neglect the deep need of the soul.</i></b></p>
<p><b><i></i></b><br></p>
<p><b><i>Many that sleep in this place of rest</i></b></p>
<p><b><i>Are far from their homeland, and those they loved best.</i></b></p>
<p><b><i>While we see the names of some who lie low</i></b></p>
<p><b><i>In “Flanders Fields” where red poppies grow,</i></b></p>
<p><b><i>These brave lads and their comrades suffered hardship and pain</i></b></p>
<p><b><i>God grant that such sacrifice may have not been in vain.</i></b></p>
<p><b><i></i></b><br></p>
<p><b><i>There comes to us too a memory sweet</i></b></p>
<p><b><i>Of a pastor, who guided the erring feet</i></b></p>
<p><b><i>Of his flock. For more than thirty years</i></b></p>
<p><b><i>He shared all their joys, their sorrows and fears.</i></b></p>
<p><b><i>When he answered the call and “entered into rest”</i></b></p>
<p><b><i>He was laid in this spot that we know he loved best.</i></b></p>
<p><b><i></i></b><br></p>
<p><b><i>The robin was silent and all else was still,</i></b></p>
<p><b><i>The shadows were falling on river and hill;</i></b></p>
<p><b><i></i></b><br></p>
<p><b><i>The deep prayerful silence of that evening calm</i></b></p>
<p><b><i>Fell o’er the spirit like a blest soothing balm,</i></b></p>
<p><b><i>As we turned from the spot marked by newly turned sod</i></b></p>
<p><b><i>Our thoughts were turned upward and nearer to God.</i></b></p>

<p><b>About the poem</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>My father, Elmer Glendenning, was buried in the Black River Cemetery on May 21, 1938.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The poem reprinted here appeared shortly after.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Although I have a copy of the poem, it does not show the name of the paper or the date of printing but I assume that it appeared in the Chatham Gazette.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I always understood that it was written by Mrs. F. A. (Bessie Watling) Fowlie.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The stranger, referred to in the opening line, may have been Sgt. Bedford Peters, an RCMP officer and cousin of my father who was stationed in Newcastle at the time</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Callister Hall</b><b></b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I was pleased to have a phone call recently from Joy Ayer, a first cousin once removed, telling me that she had just returned from a visit to Scotland including a visit to Callister Hall.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My Great Grandfather, John Glendinning was born at Callister Hall on April 2, 1807 and came to Canada in 1830, purchased property along the east coast of the Bay de Chaleur but eventually moved to Canobie.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Callister Hall is a one-storey stone building with stucco in the midst of sheep country.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Joy also visited some cemeteries in the area.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Callister Hall had recently changed hands and she visited on moving day.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The new owners invited her in to look around.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Although I had visited Callister Hall I was not able to go inside.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Joy has another link with that part of Scotland through the Beatties; her father was a Beattie.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My <br>
Grandfather’s Grandfather, James Glendinning, married Isabel Beattie but we’ve not yet connected our families through the Beattie line.</p>
