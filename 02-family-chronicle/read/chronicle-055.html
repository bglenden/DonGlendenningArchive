	<p>Dad
	purchased a Model T. Ford, year unknown, but Lillian (Weeks)
	Glendenning thought that he had purchased it from MacLennan’s
	Garage in Chatham (At the corner of the Park).  Lillian remembered
	that the salesman let Grace tryout the car before Dad bought it. 
	Sometime after 1931 he purchased a 1929  Model A 2-door Sedan –
	purchased, I believe, from the Babineau sisters (The Babineau's
	operated the movie theatre in Chatham.)  According to both Walter
	and Lillian, the car was purchased on the day that Annie MacDougall
	died. 
	</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>Walter
	worked with Dad cutting wood up Bay du Vin River to earn money to
	buy one of the cars; I cannot recall which one.  Shown above are the
	1928 registrations for the Model T Ford and in 1938 for the Model A.
	Ford  Thanks to Lillian (Glendenning) Murray for access to the
	original documents.</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>The gas
	tank for the Model A, and perhaps for the Model T, was just in front
	of the windshield and gas flowed by gravity to the engine.  On very
	steep hills, the Tabisintac for example, the car had to be turned
	around and driven backward up the hill.  .  Dad upset the Model T at
	Gilberts Corner, near Shediac, the day he brought Grace home from
	business college.  The Model A sat in the old wagon shed, presumably
	because of the recession.   Walter said that Dad allowed $2.00 worth
	of gas each week but I do not recall for what year.  Gas pumps of
	the day were pumped by hand to fill a chamber at the top of the
	pump.  The gas then flowed by gravity through the hose to the gas
	tank on a car.</p>

	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>I seldom was able to take a lunch to school 
	</p>
	<h6 style="orphans: 0; font-weight: normal; widows: 0">
	but Arbour Day was an exception.  Mum packed a lunch in a 5-pound
	Dominion shortening pail – red with yellow lettering as I recall. 
	(Some homes used Crisco but we always used Dominion shortening)   I
	cannot recall the kind of sandwiches but I do remember the bottle of
	milk.  Mum used an empty vanilla bottle – the large one.  At
	school, I took a piece of string and tied it to the neck of the
	bottle.  Then the bottle was taken to a spot under the Miller’s
	Bridge and left in the cold brook until lunchtime.  I must have tied
	the bottle to a nail or perhaps to a rock.  The milk was ooh so cold
	and tasted so good.  You must remember that we did not have a
	refrigerator at that time so our milk at home was kept cold by
	keeping it in the basement.</h6>

	<h6 style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">Dumfriesshire,
	Scotland</h6>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>My great Grandfather, John Glendinning, was born
	in Callister Hall in Dumfriesshire, Scotland in 1807.  He came to
	New Brunswick in 1830.  <u>Bartholemew’s Gazetteer of the British
	Isles, 1887</u>, described Dumfriesshire as follows:</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p><i>DUMFRIESSHIRE, maritime co., on S. border of Scotland; adjoins
	the cos. Of Lanark, Peebles and Selkirk on the N., and on the South
	is washed by the Solway Firth; extends about 53 miles NW. and SE,
	between Ayrshire and Cumberland, and about 32 miles NE. and SW.
	between Roxburghshire and Kircudbrightshire; a coast-line about 20
	miles; area, 680,217 ac., pop. 76,140, or 72 persons to each sq.
	mile.  The surface generally is bare and hilly.  The dales of the
	Nith, Annan, and Esk, however, are rich in beauty, and contain fine
	holms for pasture and some good arable land.  The rivers are
	numerous, and yield splendid salmon and trout fishing.  The coast
	and S. region is low and sandy; much of it is covered with morass,
	and lochs are numerous around Lockerbie; but there is also much good
	corn-growing land.  The Lowther or Lead Hills along the N. boundary
	are upwards of 2000 ft. in height, and abound in lead ore.  These
	and other hills round the borders are mostly smooth in outline, and
	afford excellent pasturage.  Red sandstone is a prevailing rock, and
	limestone, coal, and lead are worked.”</i></p>

	<h6 style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">George Watling</h6>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>While reminiscing recently with George Watling,
	he reminded me of an occasion when he and I were at Walter’s place
	across from the Presbyterian Church (The former Dan MacLean
	property.).  Readers who know the area will remember the long lane
	and the high bridge over the brook.  It was a hot summer day and we
	were playing in the brook – stark naked.  (I do not ever remember
	having a bathing suit when I was young even when we swam at our
	shore.)   Anyway, we were enjoying ourselves until we spotted Kate
	MacLean walking in the lane with Ian and Allistair Morrison. 
	Needless to say, we scampered for cover.  (Rev. Morrison was the
	United Church Minister at the time.  Ian was my age; Allistair was a
	year or two older.  Wonder what ever became of them? )</p>

	<p><b>Watling Connections to PEI</b></p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>Family lore states that Jubal Watling came to New
	Brunswick via Prince Edward Island.  A search of the records in PEI
	located a Jubal Watling who had moved to PEI from Norfolk, England
	and settled on Lot 52.  The PEI Jubal married Louisa ? on July 14,
	1831; both had emigrated to Canada.</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>It is not impossible that the two are one and the
	same but I think not.  Even if one speculates that Susan Leach died
	in England, ages and place of birth of children doesn’t fit.  I’m
	not ruling it out but need more information to be certain. 
	</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>Another possibility is that our Jubal came to
	visit some cousins on PEI and then decided to move to New Brunswick
	to secure work with the booming lumber industry in the Miramichi. 
	That is what brought others to the area including , I was told, the
	MacKenzies, Andersons and Allens who settled on the upper reaches of
	the Little Black River.
