<p>The Gleaner of Chatham, NB in 1834 carried mostly international news, shipping information, and advertisements, however, on January 7, 1834, the Gleaner carried the following “ORIGINAL” item:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>BAY DU VIN RIVER</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>“After twisting and tumbling in its narrow channel, a distance of about 30 miles, through fertile soils and frowning forests, the Bay du Vin River, about three miles further up the Miramichi than the Bay du Vin Island, discharges itself into the ever disturbed bosom of the Bay du Vin or “Windy Bay.’</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Several rustling streams fall into the Bay du Vin River.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The ‘Back,’ and Robichaux Creeks – the ‘Main’ and Goodfellow’s Forks, are four of its tributaries; the two former empty themselves near its entrance; the Main forks about 15 miles up, and the Goodfellow’s Forks a short distance of its source.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>About 17 miles to the S. and Eastward of the Town of Chatham, the traveler crosses the Bay du Vin, on an excellent wooden Bridge, being then about equally distant from Bay du Vin Bay, and the swamps and springs from which the river flow.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>On its eastern bank, soon as the Bay du Vin has opened itself to the eye of the mariner in sailing the channel of the Miramichi, several delightful situations – on which stand neat little dwellings – claim his observation; these mostly belong to the family of the lately deceased John B. Williston, by whose industry and enterprise at an early period in the history of New Brunswick, a Saw Mill had been erected about 5 miles above his last residence; not many years however after its erection, a destructive inundation of the Bay du Vin swept it wholly away. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>About two miles further up than the spot on which stood the Mill, is a Saw Mill belonging to the highly philanthropic and enterprising House of the Hon. Joseph Cunard &amp; Co., - besides being a manufacturer of one of the country’s principal resources; this Mill will be found to be of exceeding consequence to facilitate the erection of dwellings &amp;c., in the extensive, but infant settlement, to which it belongs.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Remote from the principal timber market, the abundant groves on the banks of the Bay du Vin, have continued to wave their lofty tops, while those on nearby streams have been felled and sent to Britain; - to which circumstances may be mainly attributed the prolonged existence of lumbering, and the almost total neglect of Agriculture. – Experience had shown that throughout these Provinces generally, as Limbering has decreased, in the same ratio has Agriculture encreased; - men cannot be both Lumberers and Farmers, this were to suppose the rough tar fit for the tardy Teamster; - the occupation – and hence the habits and practices of the one so diametrically opposed to the other, that nature forbids the connexion.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>On the Bay du Vin Lumbering continues to be prosecuted and Agriculture to be neglected.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>But even on the Bay du Vin the Timber groves have now become ‘few and far between.’<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Let the Bay du Vinite then throw aside the boat hook, broad axe, and handspike, and take up the implements of Husbandry,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>- let him wean himself from his wild habits, and learn to love the peace of his own fireside more than the ravings of the debased camp.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The Bay and River of Bay du Vin team with fish; every Lot abounds with either Spars, Juniper or Pine; - his own property thus affords winter employment; and the spare time of summer may be prudently and profitably spent in fishing; but all should be made subservient to the interests and duties of the Farm; since to it should he look for a peaceful resting, when his strength and vigour fail, and his evening sun is sinking behind the horizon of time, to rise in bright regions of ‘ Eternal Day.’”</p>
