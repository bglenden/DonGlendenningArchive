	<p align="justify">My
	father’s oldest sister, Venetia, married Robinson Lincoln Doring. 
	The following obituary was taken from the Florida Advocate dated May
	29, 1936.</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify"><i>Robinson
	Doring Dies at Bowling Green Home</i></p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify"><i>Robinson
	L. Doring, 72, died at his residence west of Bowling Green on
	Wednesday after a lengthy illness.  He was born in Perry, Maine
	April 24, 1864.  Moving to Bowling Green in 1915, from Portland,
	Me., the deceased had lived there until his death.</i></p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify"><i>Mr. Doring followed hydro-electric powerhouse,
	dam and paper mill construction as an engineer and general
	construction superintendent until retiring in 1930 at his Bowling
	Green home.  His largest construction jobs were the Stevens Creek
	dam and powerhouse across the Savannah River above Augusta, Georgia;
	a large dirt dam and canal irrigation system in Idaho, and the
	construction during the World War in Amatol, N. J. of the most
	complete and largest ammunition loading plant and townsite in the
	United States.</i></p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify"><i>Survivors
	are his widow, Mrs. Venetia G. Doring; a daughter, Miss Verna
	Elizabeth; two sons, Walter G. and John S. Doring all of Bowling
	Green, and two sisters, Mrs. Charles Shaw of Perry, Me., and Miss
	Jessie Doring, supervisor of …(Unable to read)</i></p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify"><i>Funeral
	services were conducted from the residence of the deceased yesterday
	afternoon at 3 o’clock under the direction of Coker’s Funeral
	Home, of this city, with Rev. J.F. Clark, of Bowling Green
	officiating.  Interment was in Bowling Green cemetery with the
	Masonic Order in Charge.</i></p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">I
	decided to check out Amatol, New Jersey and found that construction
	of a plant and a townsite for 10,000 people commenced in March, 1918
	and was completed in 9 months.  The only one of the original
	buildings still standing is the former barracks of the New Jersey
	State Police on White Horse Pike.  There was a major explosion at
	the plant on July 10, 1926 but fortunately it was a Saturday and few
	men were at work.  I do not know if there was any rebuilding but,
	according to what I read, the town soon disappeared.  Fascinating
	story !</p>

	</p>
	<p align="justify">Larry Brideau and John Paul were drowned at
	Victoria Bridge, Black River, on June 10, 1938. (Or was it 1937?)
	They were peeling pulpwood at Hexham and decided to go for a swim at
	the end of the day.  I remember going down to the Victoria Bridge
	next day and seeing the raft and divers at the side of the Victoria
	Bridge.

	<p align="justify"><i>Down

	</p>
	<p align="justify"><i>Never

	<p align="justify"><i>He

	<h6 style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">Boxing Match</h6>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>June 22,
	1938 was a beautiful sunny summer day.  I recall sitting under the
	apple tree in the front yard with Mum.  Across the road, a few
	people gathered at Uncle Jim’s to listen to the radio.  Uncle Jim
	had removed the lower sash of the kitchen window so the men could
	hear the broadcast better.  It was a rematch between boxing great,
	Joe Louis, and Max Schmelling.  Mum would not let me go across to
	listen although I could still hear from across the road.</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>Feelings
	ran high.  Schmelling had beaten Louis in an earlier match.  With
	the saber rattling in Germany, there was much anti-German sentiment.</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>Round one
	began; 2.08 minutes later the fight was over.  Louis knocked out
	Schmelling.  The fight was over.  The men lingered for a few minutes
	and then went home.</p>
