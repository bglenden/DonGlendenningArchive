	<p align="justify"><b>Glenelg</b><i>
	</i>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">I
	am indebted to Donald Edge for the following item on Glenelg.  
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify"><i>Glenelg
	Parish: Name,History, 1840 Census</i></p>
	<p align="justify">  
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><i>Glenelg
	in geography is one of the most common palindromes, a  name that
	reads the same backwards and forwards. The original Glenelg in the
	highlands of Scotland is both a village and a mountainous peninsula
	and a bay in Ross-Shire that look across the Sound of Sleat to the
	Isle of Skye.  This highland name Glenelg is said to derive from the
	Gaelic Gleann Seilg, the Glen of Hunting.  </i>
	</p>
	<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify"><i>There
	are many other Glenelgs, including  a Glenelg village and lake in
	Nova Scotia, and a Glenelg in Ontario.  In the 1830's Lord Glenelg
	was England's Secretary of State for the Colonies; and his name
	commonly appears on Australian and New Zealand rivers and street
	signs. </i>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify"><i>Our
	Glenelg Parish is &quot;So named for the native place in Scotland of
	major McDonald of the 78th Highlanders, a prominent resident, who
	settled there about 1790.&quot;*</i></p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify"><i>Originally
	a part of Newcastle Parish, the New Brunswick Northumberland County 
	Parish of Glenelg was set up in 1814 and included  Nelson,
	Hardwicke, and a small part of Rogersville. Hardwicke was set up in
	1851 as a separate parish, and Rogersville set up in 1881.  Glenelg 
	took its final and present form in 1900.</i></p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify"><i>In
	the 1840 Census the old Glenelg Parish had 237 houses sheltering 244
	families; 11 houses were under construction [there were 281 houses
	in the 1851 Census]. The population was 1351--690 males and 661
	females**; there were no residents &quot;of Colour.&quot;  There
	were 3828 cleared acres, and the community was  served by 3 grist
	mills and 1 saw mill. There were four churches: 1 Church of England,
	2 Presbyterian, and 1 Roman Catholic.  People outnumbered churches,
	but people</i><i> </i><i>were
	far outnumbered by farm animals.  There were 249 horses, 1155 &quot;Neat
	Cattle,&quot; 943 sheep, and 852 swine.  Poultry were probably too
	small to mention and too numerous to count.</i></p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify"> <i>Folks
	in Black River in palindromic Glenelg Parish were more forward than
	backward--all the folks I knew there were humorous and quick--and
	often quite contrary.</i></p>

	<p align="justify"><br />

	<p align="justify"> <i>**While
	men age 16 and over outnumbered women  age 16 and over  in all
	parishes, Glenelg had a disproportionate number of females under age
	16 - -389 vs.  272 males  under age 16.</i></p>

	</p>
	<p align="justify">My
	brother Ken remembers the drowning at the Victoria Bridge. He
	probably spent the best part of 3 or 4 days watching the divers
	searching for bodies. As he recalls, they found the last body along
	Jimmie Cameron’s shore. 
	</p>
	<p align="justify" style="page-break-after: avoid"><b>MacBeath
	Brook</b></p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">Donald
	Edge tells me that “<i><b>McBeath
	Brook is one of the Black River feeders where the river forms in the
	marshes not far from Barnaby River.  It can be found on NTS map
	021114 at 46 degrees 55' 00&quot; N and 65 degrees 21'  00&quot; W”</b></i></p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<h6 align="justify" style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">Neighbours</h6>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">It
	was not unusual for neighbours to have the same name, in which case
	nicknames were used.  Some of the following people I knew; others
	were simply names I remember.  There was <b>Jim
	Cameron, Jimmie</b>
	<b>Cameron</b>,
	and <b>Jim Twin</b>
	whose real name was Jim Cameron; Jim and his brother Frank were
	twins.  <b>Jimmie
	Major</b> and his
	brother, <b>Alex
	Major</b>, were really
	<b>Jim</b>
	and <b>Alex MacDonald</b>
	sons of Major MacDonald (I am not sure if Major was a title or a
	name).  <b>Johnnie
	Archie</b> was John
	Archibald MacNaughton or was he John MacNaughton the son of Archie
	Mac Naughton?; <b>Arch
	Hughie</b> was Arch
	son of Hughie Cameron;  <b>Fred
	Bacon</b> was Fred
	Williston the son of Bacon Williston?;  <b>Candy
	Alex</b> was the
	Alexander MacDonald who lived at the corner where the “Shortcut”
	met the Point Aux Carr Road.  <b>Jessie
	Add</b> was Mrs. Add
	Fowlie.  <b>John B</b>
	was John MacDonald; <b>Donald
	Angus</b> was Donald
	MacDonald, <b>Tommy
	Goymer</b> was Tommie
	Williston the son of Goymer Williston; I believe that <b>Big
	George, Little George and Jim George </b>were
	all Willistons. Then there were names such as <b>Long
	Earl</b>; <b>Big
	Bob, Little Willie, Fat Willie, Little Donald, Big Donald.  Young
	Geordie</b>, <b>Big
	Ern</b> and his
	father, <b>Big Arch</b>.
	 
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">At
	one time Ken, Norm and I were all at the MRHS at the same time.  One
	teacher, who taught both Norm and I (dould it have been Miss
	Hetherington?) called Norman, <b>Big
	Glendenning,</b> and
	called me, <b>Little
	Glendenning</b>.  She
	did not teach Ken.</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<h6 align="justify" style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">The
	Crust</h6>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">I
	was out to the woods recently and was able to walk on the crust –
	at least where there was still some shade.  The crust refers to the
	frozen top inch or two of the snow and was common in the springtime
	but could occur at other times after a mild spell.  Temperatures at
	night would be below freezing but the days would warm up and the
	snow, and ground showing through it, would soften up.</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">The
	crust was great for coasting, and for taking a short cut when
	visiting neighbours.  One could even bicycle on the crust although
	it was often tricky.  I recall one incident when riding towards home
	from the Branch corner and my front wheel dropped through the crust
	and threw me off.  The crust was also great for coasting;
	unfortunately it usually marked the end of the coasting season.</p>

	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">Perley
	Quayle<b> </b>followed
	Mr. Mstrong, as I ecall, as Principal of MRHS.  I do not know much
	about his backgsround but he was a very fine person.  He could quote
	Shakespeare as well as repair a car.  He lived in the Sunny corner
	area, Williamstown Road?, and, I am told had a shop filled with
	equipment.  Among other things, be brought a very large wood turning
	lathe to the school for our use.  It was powered by a bedal like a
	sewing machine.  One person could not work the pedal and turn a
	piece at the same tome.</p>
