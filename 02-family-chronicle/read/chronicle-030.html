	<h5>Teachers</h5>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>During a
	recent visit to the Miramichi, Venetia, Ken and I were trying to
	recall our teachers at the Little Branch School.  The following is a
	preliminary list:</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>Margerite
	Bell (Mrs. George MacDonald)</p>
	<p>Katie
	(MacNaughton) Neilson</p>
	<p>Annie
	Ellis – 1925?</p>
	<p>Jeni
	Oleskevis</p>
	<p>Charles
	Spencer – 2 years</p>
	<p>Donald
	MacLean – 2 years</p>
	<p>Rilma
	Tracy</p>
	<p>Mary
	(Godfrey) Williston – at least three years</p>
	<p>Bertie
	MacLean – 1938?</p>
	<p>Marion
	Smith</p>
	<p>Venetia
	Russell – 1955-1958</p>
	<p>Mrs.
	Freddie Fowlie</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p><b>We know
	there are others.  Please help.</b></p>
	<p><br />

	<h5>Point Aux
	Carr Trappers</h5>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>Ken stayed
	with Venetia and Cam during the winter of 1937-38 and attended the
	Point Aux Carr school.  One weekend, Norman went to visit.  He
	crossed the ice at McKnight’s Point and walked out the Point Aux
	Carr Road.  Ken walked in and met him about half-way.</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>Ken and
	Fowlie Gillis had been catching a few rabbits.  On Saturday morning,
	Ken and Fowlie went out early to the snares taking  a couple of
	rabbits caught the day before.  Into one of the snares they put two
	rabbits.</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>Later in
	the morning, Norm and Mac Gillis were invited along when they went
	to “fish” their snares.  Imagine the excitement of Norm and Mac
	when they found two rabbits in one snare.</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>The Muddy
	Trail</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>I was born
	in Old Black River</p>
	<p>Over sixty
	years ago.</p>
	<p>It was a
	Sunday night and it was dark</p>
	<p>My
	neighbour told me so.</p>
	<p>It was the
	eleventh day of May</p>
	<p>In
	nineteen hundred and eight.</p>
	<p>When a
	neighbour went for a stork.</p>
	<p>They say
	her name was Kate.</p>
	<p>He had
	about four miles to go</p>
	<p>Through
	deep ruts in the mud</p>
	<p>And some
	places on the south side.</p>
	<p>The wagon
	steps they drug.</p>
	<p>That night
	I came into this world.</p>
	<p>The stork
	was waiting there.</p>
	<p>She had
	just arrived five minutes before.</p>
	<p>There was
	no time to spare.</p>
	<p>This lady
	took me in her arms.</p>
	<p>She laid
	me on the “bug’</p>
	<p>And when I
	opened my blue eyes</p>
	<p>The first
	thing I saw was mud.</p>
	<p>As time
	went on and years rolled by.</p>
	<p>Eventually
	I grew.</p>
	<p>So I got
	long and slinky</p>
	<p>And now
	I’m six foot two.</p>
	<p>I haven’t
	got no learning</p>
	<p>For I
	never went to school.</p>
	<p>I never
	learned about Tom’s dog.</p>
	<p>Or was
	taught the golden rule.</p>
	<p>I take
	great delight in wild life.</p>
	<p>For I
	hunted all my life.</p>
	<p>But the
	women wouldn’t look at me.</p>
	<p>That’s
	why I have no wife.</p>
	<p>I trapped
	all kinds of animals</p>
	<p>From a
	weasel to a bear.</p>
	<p>I’ve
	shot all kinds of venison.</p>
	<p>From a
	bull moose down to a hare.</p>
	<p>I never
	wandered far from home.</p>
	<p>I’m
	still here on the “bug”.</p>
	<p>For every
	time I made a move</p>
	<p>I was
	spinning in the mud.</p>
	<p>I walk
	this side road twice a week</p>
	<p>To buy
	something to eat.</p>
	<p>But I
	never feel the worse of it.</p>
	<p>For it’s
	soft and easy on my feet.</p>
	<p>Now there
	isn’t much traffic on this side.</p>
	<p>For it is
	a soopy trail.</p>
	<p>For every
	mile you have to stop</p>
	<p>To wash
	your lights and bail.</p>
	<p>You can’t
	be in a hurry</p>
	<p>For a
	spray goes o’er your hood.</p>
	<p>If a
	walker chances to meet a car.</p>
	<p>He’s got
	to take the woods.</p>
	<p>They call
	it just a dump hole</p>
	<p>And I
	believe it’s true.</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>For every
	few yards in the ditch</p>
	<p>There’s
	a garbage bag or two.</p>
	<p>It was
	this side road that started mini-skirts.</p>
	<p>They
	didn’t start before the flood.</p>
	<p>For if
	they wore their skirts down to their knees.</p>
	<p>They’d
	be dropping in the mud.</p>
	<p>We would
	like to have this side road built.</p>
	<p>Or the
	people they’ll soon raz.</p>
	<p>For if the
	mud gets any deeper.</p>
	<p>They’ll
	need mud flaps on their bras.</p>
	<p>You go
	along the side of it</p>
	<p>And pick
	your way across.</p>
	<p>But we
	know someone who will pave our road.</p>
	<p>Our old
	stand by Jack Frost</p>
	<p>They
	promised to fix this road.</p>
	<p>For as
	long as I can mind.</p>
	<p>They say
	we have it on our list.</p>
	<p>But it’s
	on the bottom line.</p>
	<p>They
	brought one load of gravel.</p>
	<p>About two
	years ago;</p>
	<p>They
	didn’t spread it on the road.</p>
	<p>For it
	would make an awful show.</p>
	<p>They
	hauled it up and down the road.</p>
	<p>Looked in
	every little nook.</p>
	<p>They seen
	no place that needed it.</p>
	<p>Dumped it
	o’er the bank of Wells’ Brook.</p>
	<p>They came
	again with mud stone.</p>
	<p>And as
	they worked past the gate.</p>
	<p>They
	spread it just about as thick</p>
	<p>As
	frosting on a cake.</p>
	<p>They
	worked on both ends of it.</p>
	<p>With
	mud-stone mixed with ground.</p>
	<p>They had
	to be very careful</p>
	<p>To have
	enough to go around.</p>
	<p>We had all
	kinds of members.</p>
	<p>Enough to
	form a ring</p>
	<p>And when
	it comes to governments</p>
	<p>It didn’t
	mean a thing.</p>
	<p>If Larry
	Gorman was living now</p>
	<p>I’m sure
	he’d write a song.</p>
	<p>He’d
	take the weight of everything.</p>
	<p>And it
	wouldn’t take him long.</p>
	<p>Now some
	folk when they read this poem.</p>
	<p>May think
	that I’m a goof.</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>But when
	they sum the whole thing up.</p>
	<p>You’ll
	find that it’s the truth.</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>		An old
	tax-payer</p>
	<p>		Stuck
	here in the mud</p>
	<p><br />
