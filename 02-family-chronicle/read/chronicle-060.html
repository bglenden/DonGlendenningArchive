	<p align="justify" style="widows: 2; orphans: 2">At
	first, church services were held in the local school but in 1899
	this church was built and used by Presbyterians, Methodists and
	Anglicans.  (It is now an Anglican Church).  
	</p>
	<p align="justify" style="widows: 2; orphans: 2"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify" style="widows: 2; orphans: 2">Our
	Grandfather, Walter, was active in the church including being a
	Sunday school teacher.  He is also reported to have been one of the
	first trustees and, according to the Chaleur history, cut the first
	lumber to start the building.  The 1891 census shows Walter as
	Presbyterian.</p>

	<p align="justify" style="widows: 2; orphans: 2">I
	do not know where my Great Grandparents, John and Margaret
	Glendinning are buried but believe them to be buried in the New
	Bandon Cemetery where a number of their descendants are buried. 
	George Glendenning told me that on a number of occasions bones were
	encountered when digging new graves in that cemetery.  George also
	thinks that John Glendinning may have attended/been a member of the
	Methodist Church.</p>

	<p><i>More
	Socks, Wristlets and Mittens Sent in For Our Soldiers</i></p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p><i>The
	ladies of Northumberland County continue to send to this office
	various articles of warm apparel to be forwarded to the young men
	who have volunteered for active service in Canada’s Second
	Contingent. Last week we received from Miss Katie Watling, 31 pairs
	socks, also 10 pairs wristlets and 4 pairs mittens, all home-knit,
	that had been collected by her from the people of Black River,
	Little Branch and Hexham.</i></p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p><i>With
	the advent of the cold weather, these comforts will doubtless be
	doubly appreciated by the lads who have signified their willingness
	to brave all the discomforts of a winter campaign in a foreign
	country. It has been truly said that “Let a man’s feet get cold
	and he is all cold.” Evidently this truism is realized by the
	ladies of our county, who are thus doing their part to prevent our
	boys having cold feet or hands while on the march or in the
	trenches; and to ensure them being in fit condition to enjoy the
	festivities at Berlin on their arrival their.</i></p>

	to Barry MacKenzie and Janet Watling on the launch of their new
	journal, the Family Herald.  Anyone wishing to subscribe should
	contact Barry at <u><a href="mailto:barrymack4@hotmail.com">barrymack4@hotmail.com</a></u></p>

	Family Herald</h6>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">The
	Family Herald and Weekly Star was a popular weekly newspaper of my
	day – a newspaper primarily for the agricultural community.  It
	was about half the size of a regular newspaper but quite a thick
	paper.  I would guess that it had 30 to 40 pages including some
	news, advertisements, “funnies”, recipes, etc.  It was well read
	in our household.</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<h6 align="justify" style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">Chatham
	Gazette</h6>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">The
	local paper in our household was the Chatham Gazette.  I think that
	it was published twice a week.  It was a regular sized paper but
	always seemed to have larger print than other newspapers.  My
	sister, Grace, subscribed to the Gazette most of her life even
	though she had left Black River as a young woman.</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">First
	Radios</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p>My sister, Lillian, recalled that Malcolm
	MacNaughton from the north side of Black River was the first one in
	the community to have a radio.  People used to visit to listen and
	had to take turns listening through earphones.  The next two radios
	were Herb Fowlie and Uncle Jim Watling.</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">Walter
	and Venetia bought the first radio at my home.  It sat in the dining
	room near the back wall.  A copper wire was run as an aerial from
	the eave of the house to a tall, slender pole at the gatepost near
	the henhouse.  
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">The
	radio was powered, as I recall by a 6-volt car battery (was that the
	A Battery?), two B-Batteries cylindrical and about 3 inches in
	diameter, and a C-battery, which was the size of a box of soda.</p>
