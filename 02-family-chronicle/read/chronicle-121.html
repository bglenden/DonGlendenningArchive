	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><b>I
	had some of my slides scanned recently and came across the above
	photos of Fowlie’s mill probably taken in the 1950’s. 
	(Glendenning Collection)</b></p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Meat</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">We
	had our own meat, especially in the winter.  We did not have
	electricity, hence no refrigeration although we did have an icehouse
	one year, so the amount and kind of meat varied from season to
	season.  In winter, meat could be kept hanging in the shed with
	portions cut off as needed; in summer when an animal was butchered
	most of it was sold in town or to neighbours but some was kept for
	our own use.  In later years, Norman would butcher a young heifer
	and peddle it from door to door around Black River.  Jack Gibson was
	a butcher and often peddled meat and later Will Harris was a regular
	meat peddler.</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Butchering
	was done just inside the large barn doors.  The animal was brought
	to the door and its head held down and steadied with the aid of a
	ring buried in the barn floor.  A sledge hammer or poll axe was used
	to stun the animal then its throat was cut.  Following that, the
	animal would be skinned starting with the hind legs. A short stick,
	a spreader, was used to spread the hind legs and this was attached
	to a set of blocks (pulleys and ropes) so that the animal could be
	hoisted. The butchers continued to skin the animal moving down
	towards the head; from time to time the animal was raised to make it
	easier to skin and to keep the fresh meat from coming in contact
	with the floor.  After skinning, the front of the animal was opened,
	again from top down and the intestines and organs removed.  The
	intestines were dragged to the manure shed or buried.  The heart and
	liver were saved and were considered, at least by me, as a special
	treat.</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">For
	pigs, a fire was lighted under a large black pot or a barrel and the
	water brought to a boil.  Then the pig was killed and hoisted on a
	pulley.  Next a large barrel was placed under the pig and filled
	with the boiling water.  The pig was dipped into the boiling water
	to make it easier to scrape off the bristles.  One had to be careful
	not to have the water too hot, it would scald and discolour the
	carcass, or too cool or it would not lift the bristles and therefore
	would be difficult to scrape clean.  
	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Young
	calves were killed at about 4 weeks and sold as veal.  Veil was
	often delivered directly to a restaurant.  I remember delivering
	many a veal to Cheverie’s restaurant on Cunard Street.  Carol and
	I ate their once and I remember seeing a note on the menu stating
	“Our Restaurant is supervised by a Registered Nurse.”</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Sometimes
	Mum made head cheese or potted meat using the pig’s feet.  Many
	people had rabbit but I cannot remember having any at our house.</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Of
	course, we also had chicken, and an occasional turkey, goose and
	duck.  Chickens were killed by cutting off their heads. Sometimes
	boiling water was poured over the chicken to help loosen the
	feathers.  When John took his course in Newcastle, he learned to
	kill chickens with the use of a sharp knife into the brain.  Then
	they could be plucked very easily.  This made the task so much
	easier.</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Each
	time we butchered, a piece of fresh meat went to Aunt Tine.  She
	lived in Loggieville and at that time people traveled to Chatham by
	way of Loggieville.</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">The
	only meat I can remember buying in the early years was bologna from
	Adam’s store across the River.  Fried bologna with eggs was common
	for breakfast, often we had bologna sandwiches in our lunch boxes
	and occasionally we had bologna for dinner or supper.  (In my day,
	dinner was at noon and supper was an evening meal.  Both were full
	meals.)</p>
