</p>
	<p align="center"><b>Lillian
	taken in Hampton, Virginia</b></p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>Lillian
	was born at 3 Perkins St., Fairhaven, Conn., USA, where Dad was
	working at the time.  She would have traveled with the family to
	Hampton, Virginia and Muscle Shoals, Alabama before returning to
	Little Branch in 1919.  She attended Little Branch School for a few
	years but admitted that she did not like school.  
	</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>In
	school, students required a slate cloth and water to main clean
	slates.  Once Lillian dropped her slate cloth and instead of picking
	it up, tied the ankle of the student in front of her to the leg of
	the desk.  When the teacher called the girl to come to the board,
	the slate cloth tripped her.</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>Dad
	was returning from Moncton; Lillian was with him and maybe others. 
	Near Rexton, a car tried to run him off the road.  Lillian thought
	that they were rumrunners but perhaps the rum was inside them rather
	than just in the car.  Dad pulled in to a store/gas station and
	phoned the RCMP.  A car came from Newcastle.  Lillian remembered
	riding in the police car as far as John W. MacNaughton's.</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>Lillian
	was a close friend of Maxine Macdonald and they used to visit back
	and forth.  One of Mum’s tricks was to ask Lillian to take a note
	over to Maxine’s mother.  She dutifully carried the noted a
	half-mile to Maxine’s place.  She did not know it at the time, but
	the note simply said “Please send Lillian home after a while.”</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>At
	age 16, Lillian was glad to go to Boston to work.  Ken remembers the
	phone call from her sister, Grace, who was living on Beacon Street
	at the time, saying that there was a job for her in Boston; Walter
	took Mum, Venetia and Lillian to catch the train at Newcastle.  She
	arrived in Boston on September 22, 1933 and, I think, stayed with
	Dad’s cousin, Sam Knowles, for a while.  The next night, she went
	to a dance with Grace and Roy to celebrate Grace’s 22<sup>nd</sup>
	birthday.</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>While
	in Boston, Lillian did housework and looked after children first for
	Mrs. Fineberg, who was a singer, and later for Mrs. Piser.  Her last
	employer was Mrs. Walker where she worked for 5-6 years.  One of her
	addresses was “61 Mayo Avenue, Needham.”</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>Brydone
	and Lillian met on April 18, 1933 while Lillian was visiting with
	Aunt Tine in Loggieville.  There was a service in the United Church
	and afterward the young people played badminton.  Brydone walked
	Lillian back to Aunt Tine’s.  They courted for over 6 years. 
	Lillian came home most summers but Brydone also visited her in
	Boston.  In 1936, Brydone and Walter traveled to Boston by train
	stopping to visit in Portland on the way.  Brydone and his mother
	drove Lillian back to Boston in 1936 after Grace’s wedding.</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>I
	can remember Brydone coming to court Lillian in his Dad’s car; I
	would hang around the front door and as they got into the car. 
	Occasionally, Brydone would invite me to get in and go for a ride. 
	Sometimes the ride would include a trip to the “Bayshore” and
	end with a cone of ice cream.</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>Lillian
	and Kenneth Brydone Weeks (July 6, 1917 – Sept 16, 1994) were
	married at Little Branch on December 22, 1939. by Rev. P. McK.
	Sampson, Minister of the Sunny Corner Presbyterian Church and they
	lived in Loggieville.  Shortly after, Brydone enlisted in the North
	Shore Regiment.  Lillian lived for a while in Woodstock, and Sussex
	as well as

	</p>
	<p>Camp
	Borden.  She and the family lived in Loggieville (13 Church Lane?)
	while Brydone was overseas.  Lillian and Brydone had three children,
	John Ellery, Kenneth Brydone and Patricia Jane.</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>Brydone
	was born in Loggieville and graduated from the Loggieville High
	School.  For a number of years he worked for A&amp;R Loggie Company
	delivering groceries and feed with one of his regular routes being
	Loggieville to Escuminac.  People would phone in their orders and
	Brydone would deliver.  Once or twice he took me with him and bought
	lunch while in Escuminac.  It was quite a treat.</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>Brydone
	always wanted to farm and after leaving the army purchased a dairy
	farm near Harvey Station.  Brydone was always active in his church
	and, in late 1964, Brydone accepted a call to minister in a
	three-point Presbyterian charge with a manse provided in Stanley. 
	They lived there until retirement.</p>
	<p>Lillian
	was a people person.  She was active in her church.  She enjoyed
	company, was a great conversationalist and enjoyed both hearing and
	telling jokes.  Although she did not play any musical instrument she
	often sang while working around the house.  She also sang in the
	choir and I can still hear her singing The Old Rugged Cross. 
	Lillian, Brydone and daughter, Patricia, frequently led special
	church services with readings and song.</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>After
	Brydone retired, Lillian usually accompanied him when he substituted
	throughout Southern New Brunswick for ministers who were ill or on
	vacation.  After Brydone died, Lillian moved to Harvey Station, then
	with Ken and Beverley but eventually moved into a senior’s home in
	MacAdam.</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>Their
	homes in Harvey Station and in Stanley were favourite stopping
	places when traveling through to Boston – as well as just for
	family visits.  I frequently stayed there.  In fact, at Easter of
	1955, I was visiting when Mum phoned one night to say a letter had
	arrived saying that I had won a Beaverbrook Overseas Scholarship.  
	</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>Lillian
	was a note-maker.  She maintained a record of dates of events from
	her community and from Black River.  In 1974-75, Lillian typed 144
	pages of memories of her early years.  In 1995, I arranged for them
	to be printed and she gave copies to family and a few close friends.
	 Among other things, Lillian remembered visiting Bird Hill to
	observe the “Zepplin”, a German dirigible pass on its way to New
	York.  That is the dirigible famous for having burst into flames
	while moored in New Jersey.</p>
