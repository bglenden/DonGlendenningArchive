<div class="reader-summary">Personal recollections of Don&#x27;s fishing experiences (with photos of his catches, 2-3 lb fish from the front yard). Discusses grain milling byproducts (bran, shorts, middlings) and his family&#x27;s use of wheat milled at the &quot;Monks&quot; (Rogersville) and Robin Hood flour. Explains feed mixtures for livestock. Notes a humorous account of &quot;slipgut&quot; porridge. Discusses flour bags repurposed into clothing after bleaching. Also features Don&#x27;s 1947 photo from his first teaching position at Middle Kouchibouguac with ~21 students in Grades 1-8 plus 3 correspondence students. Personal domestic and professional snapshot of post-war rural life.</div>

</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Fish
	are elusive.  The above show some of my catches.  As I recall, most
	of the above would be between 2 and 3 pounds.  Unfortunately, I
	cannot find photos of the really large ones.  If I do come across
	them, I will include them in later issues of the Chronicle.</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Readers
	may realize that the lower photo is reversed.  It was taken in the
	front yard and the road should be on the right.  The row of wood in
	the centre was two foot furnace wood drying for the coming winter;
	it also separated the front yard from the adjacent field.</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><b>Middlings</b></p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Who
	remembers bran, shorts and middlings?    Add to that the flour
	ground at the “Monks” in Rogersville and getting Robin Hood by
	the bag.  It brings back many memories.  But let me explain.</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">All
	of the above products are related, they all come from wheat and are
	byproducts of flour milling..  
	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><b>Bran</b>
	comes mostly from the outer skin and can be either coarse or fine
	ground.</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><b>Middlings</b>
	are finer ground than bran and are mixture of the outer skin of the
	wheat and some of the inner parts.</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><b>Shorts</b>
	are a mixture of the outer and inner part of a grain of wheat and
	contain less outer fibre than middlings.</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">At
	one time Fowlie’s had a both a grist mill and sawmill but that was
	before my time.</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Sometimes
	we took wheat to Rogersville to be milled by the “Monks” – I
	do not know the order.  The resulting flour was really whole wheat
	flour, and an off-white in colour.</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Robin
	Hood by the bag, and a 100 pound bag at that, was the favourite at
	our place and, like white flour today, had much of the “nutritional
	value” removed.</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">We
	also grew oats which we took to Adams to be crushed; later we had
	our own crusher.  A mixture of crushed oats, bran, shorts and
	middlings was fed to the cattle and, presumably, to pigs as well.  
	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">There
	was also an oilcake meal, probably from sunflower seeds, added to
	the mix but neither Norman or can remember the detail. 
	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><b>Porridge</b></p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">The
	roughage of whole wheat flour, from the mill at Rogersville, was
	good for the bowels.  One neighbour who made porridge from such
	flower referred to it as “slipgut”.  When teaching nutrition at
	the Little Branch Schoo, the teacher asked the class what they had
	had for breakfast.  To which one student replied “some mornings we
	have porridge and other times we have “slipgut.”</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><b>Flour
	bags</b></p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Most
	homes bought flour by the 100 pound bag and often, like groceries an
	feed, delivered once or twice a week from Chatham and Loggieville by
	truck.  Bags were made of heavy quality cotton sewed at both ends
	and along one side.  When empty, the stitching was removed, the bags
	were washed and bleached and then used to make clothing.   
	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><b>My
	first school</b></p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

	<p align="center" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">

</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">I
	started teaching at the above school, Middle Kouchibouguac, NB, in
	September 1947.  As I recall, I hahd about 21 students in Grades 1-8
	plus 3 older students who were taking high school subjects by
	correspondence.
