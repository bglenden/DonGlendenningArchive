Don describes his 40+ year research beginning with his Great-Grandfather John Glendinning&#x27;s family Bible (emigrated Scotland 1830). Provides earliest Glendinning information: John Glendinning born April 2, 1807 at Callister Hall, Scotland, married Margaret Harley August 23, 1833. Discusses Harley and Knowles connections, Peters lineage through his grandmother Elizabeth Peters Glendenning. Notes the striking pattern of few males in the Glendenning line producing male offspring.

<p><b>Why A Newsletter</b><b></b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The Chronicle is an occasional Newsletter devoted to genealogy.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>More specifically, it deals with the genealogy of my father, Elmer Alton Glendenning, and mother, Jane Elizabeth Jardine Watling.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It=s purpose is to both share and seek information.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It will be published from time to time as the spirit moves me.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>In addition to Watling and Glendenning, my ancestors include people named Harley, Peters, Sealey, Beattie, Rae, MacDonald, McAskill, MacNaughton, Leach and Jardine.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And I am sure that there are others I have not discovered yet.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>In order to provide a perspective, I may refer to people as my Grandfather, Walter Glendenning or my Great-grandmother, Elspeth Jardine etc. This intended to show both a relationship and to help position people by generation.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I believe my information to be accurate, however, there are likely some errors in what I have.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If you find any, please let me know; I will not be offended. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I also need help in gathering information; my focus, is on information about earlier generations but I will take whatever you provide.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Reports of weddings, births and funerals often provide information about family connections.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Make a copy and send it along.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Beginning The Search</b><b></b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I started gathering family tree information, on the Glendenning side, over forty years ago.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My first source was the family Bible of my Great-grandfather, John Glendinning, who emigrated from Scotland in 1830.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The Bible was passed down to my father. I also contracted with the Scottish Ancestry Research Society in Edinburgh, Scotland to do a search.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Later, I distributed a questionnaire to my aunts and uncles on my father=s side of the family.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Then there was a long period when I did nothing.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>During the last decade I re-started the process with attention to my mother=s side.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Much of the more recent information was gathered during conversations with family members.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They, in turn, sorted through memories, clippings and notes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My sister, Venetia, and cousin, Clifton Watling, were especially helpful in providing information on the Watling side.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>As I travel, I frequently skim through phone books looking for the name Glendenning or Watling.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I frequently find Glendenning but seldom find Watling.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I have now concluded that there are many fewer Watlings than Glendennings.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Earliest Glendinnings</b><b></b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>My Great-Grandfather, John Glendinninng was born in Callister Hall, Scotland on April 2, 1807.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>His father was John Glendinning and his mother was Mary Rae.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I believe, but have not been able to prove yet, that his Grandfather was James Glendinning and his Grandmother was Isabel Beattie.</p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>Callister Hall is, or at least was, shown on maps of Scotland.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is between Annan and Langholm and not far from Dumfries and Lockerbie.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is also close to a little hamlet named Glendinning but I think that the latter has disappeared from recent maps.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I wish I could tell you that Callister Hall<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>is a grand castle surrounded by walls and a moat but it is not.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Callister Hall is a simple one-story stone building out in the hills without another house in view although one can see for miles around.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When I reach the stage of having a scanner, I will include a picture in a future newsletter.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>A number of years ago I visited Callister Hall and</p>
<p>spoke with the current occupants; they are not Glendinnings.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Apparently for a number of years Callister Hall was a coach stop.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Furthermore, I was told, that Callister Hall suffered a serious fire.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Being stone, however, the damage would be contained.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The Family Bible includes the following entries:</p>
<p><i></i><br></p>
<p><i>&gt; John Glendinning (came) to this country in 1830 - (Married in 1833) from Annan, a small seaport In Scott Land.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Was himself a native of the aforesaid country.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Born in Callister Hall, Parish of Middlebie, in 2 of April 1807 "</i><i></i></p>
<p><i></i><br></p>
<p><i>A In Memory of John Glendinning who died May 15th A.D. 1877 in Canobie, Parish of New Bandon, County of Gloucester.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A native of Scotland, Dumfries.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Born April 2nd A.D. 1807.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Died May 15th 1877.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Aged 70 years. @</i><i></i></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Harley Connection</b><b></b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>John Glendinning married Margaret Harley on, I believe, August 23, 1833.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She was born on October 23, 1803 and died on October 21, 1895.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is likely that she was related to George and John Harley, shipbuilders, who worked at Russell=s mill on what is now Beaubear=s Island.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I have not done any investigation yet of this side of the family.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Uncle Guy Glendenning told me once that John Glendinning and Margaret Harley are buried in the Presbyterian Cemetery in New Bandon, Gloucester County, New Brunswick.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Knowles Connection</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>On a headstone in the Anglican Cemetery in Salmon Beach (?) One finds the following:</p>
<p><i></i><br></p>
<p><i>William Knowles - 1783 - 1881</i></p>
<p><i>Elizabeth Harley - 1796 - 1876</i><i></i></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Harley is not a common name and, therefore, it is likely that Margaret and Elizabeth were related - maybe even sisters.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This relationship is further supported by two other beliefs.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My sister Venetia remembers visiting A Aunt Jane Knowles @.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Furthermore, when my sister Lillian first went to work in Boston, she visited a Sam Knowles who, she thought, was related to our father. (<b>Information on this likely connection would be greatly appreciated)</b><b></b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Peters Connection</b><b></b></p>
<p>Grandmother Glendenning was a Peters.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Her father was John Peters and mother was Jane Sealy.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Grandmother had a brother Norman (after whom my brother was named), a brother Robert, and a sister Susan.<b><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>(Hopefully a reader will be able to provide more information)</b><b></b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>... and the other went West.</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>It seems that every family tells the story of<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>two brothers coming to Canada at the same time but they got separated either before or after the crossing.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The other brother always A went west@.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It may be true in our case but I have not found any evidence yet.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I have some family tree information about other Glendennings in the Maritimes but have not been able to establish any connection.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I am aware of Glendennings in St. John, Moncton, Amherst, Spring Hill, Sussex, Harvey Station and other places but have not found a link so far.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is likely, however, if we could trace back another generation or two in Scotland, that a definite link could be established.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Male Descendants</b><b></b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>One is struck, when examining the male side of the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Glendenning family, how few of the males produced male offspring.<b><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span></b>The first generation born in Canada to John and Elizabeth (Harley) Glendinning included two males (John and Walter) and three females (Margaret, Mary Ann and Elizabeth Jain). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>John had one son, John, who according to my record died at age 23.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Walter, my Grandfather, had 12 children, seven being boys.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My generation includes 46 first cousins on the Glendenning side with only 14 being male.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I do not have information about the next generation.</p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>My plea</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>There is not much more that I can do in gathering family tree information without your help.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It doesn=t have to be fancy; just send the information on a cigarette pack, shingle, cheque, grocery list, toilet paper (unused) or whatever.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I will be glad to get it and will acknowledge it in my next newsletter.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><b>______________________________________</b><b></b></p>
