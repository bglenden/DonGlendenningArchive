<p><b>The Grain Harvest</b><b></b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>When PEI set up its museum system, it established a number of small museums instead of a single large one.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Consequently there is a museum devoted to fisheries, agriculture, ship building, etc.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The agricultural museum is at Orwell corner – a community founded by Selkirk settlers 200 years ago.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Actually the land around a crossroads was taken over and maintained to show how people lived 150 ears ago and has a country store, school, church, blacksmith shop, community hall, etc. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Orwell Corner is near our cottage so recently I went with a friend to see a grain harvesting demonstration.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Of course, it brought back boyhood memories.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Binding Grain <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b><b></b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>We had a binder for cutting grain; a binder differed from a reaper in that a binder tied the grain in sheaves whereas a reaper simply cut the grain and swept it off in bunches.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The binder was hauled by a team of 2 and sometimes four horses.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The cutter blade cut the grain and there were rakes which rotated and pushed the cut grain on to a moving horizontal canvas. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A binder had three canvases stretched between rollers – a horizontal one and two at a 45-degree angle.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Canvases had to be tightened from time to time and were always loosened at the end of the day.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Seems to me that the binder was always covered with a tarp at the end of the day to protect the canvas from the weather.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The horizontal canvas moved the grain until it was caught up between two vertical ones<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>which carried the grain to the assembly where the grain was tied with a piece of “binder twine”.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>(Brantford Twine Co. from Brantford, Ontario.)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>After being tied, the sheaf was kicked off the binder onto the ground.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Heavy or damp grain would sometimes jam the canvasses.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>A binder was hauled from one field to another or one farm to another by a team of horses.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Once in the field, the “bull wheel”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>(a large wide wheel which carried most of the weight) was cranked down to take the weight, the road wheels were removed, and the other small wheel was lowered.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Then the pole was removed and attached at a ninety-degree angle from where it was when traveling on the road.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The horses were hooked up again and binding could begin.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The height from the ground could be adjusted by cranking the wheels up or down so as to compensate for uneven ground or to catch short straws.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I recall hitching up 4 horses once to cut grain in the field across from the school.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I made a few successful rounds and then decided to lower the “rakes” to catch more of the grain.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As a result, the rakes caught and broke the flange, which fastened them to the hub.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>So I unhitched the horses and took them to the barn, carried some wrenches from the barn to the field, removed the wooden rakes and the cast iron flange.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We had no welder (and you cannot weld cast iron anyway).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>By then Norm came home with the truck and took the flange in town to be fixed. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Stooking Grain</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>Men walked along beside or after the binder, picking up a sheaf of grain under each arm, and then standing the sheaves on the ground to make a “teepee”.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This was called stooking (or stuking) the grain.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Stooks usually contained 6 sheaves of grain leaning against each other.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This allowed the grain and the straw to dry.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Perhaps the thing I remember most is the scratches on tender arms from holding sheaves – made worse when sheaves included thistles.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>If it rained while the sheaves were in stooks, one had to open up the stooks to let the grain dry out.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>One simply pulled the sheaves outward and let them fall on the ground.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If the wet weather was prolonged, grain could get moldy and not be worth harvesting.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Hauling loads of grain</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>When the grain was dry, perhaps 2-3 days later, it was loaded onto a wagon and hauled to the barn.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There was a technique to building a large load.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If the field was close to the barn, it probably did not make any difference but some of our fields were 2 miles from the home property so large loads save trips.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>After filling the bottom of the rack, one placed a row of sheaves along each side of the rack with the butts to the outside. Then one lapped them with a row with the butts inside.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>One kept filling the inside to bind the load but the rim of the load was always slightly higher than at the centre of the wagon. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The wagon was pulled up close to the barn and sheaves were pitched on to a loft where it was stored until threshing time.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The loft seldom held it all so sheaves of grain would also be stored on top of the hay in the mow.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Often a stack of grain would be built just outside the barn door.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Threshing</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>A threshing machine was designed to remove grain from the straw.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The grain was fed into a rotating drum with projecting spikes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The grain dropped down through the thresher and the straw continued along the top of the thresher and out the back.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The movement of the grain and straw resulted from the forward and backward movement of the upper half of the thresher.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Our thresher was set up just inside the barn door and was powered by a stationery engine. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Wooden half-bushel containers were set to catch the grain as it came out.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When the container was filled, it was replaced by another and the first one was emptied into a bag.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We had a grain shed across the yard from the barn and someone would carry the bags of grain across to the shed and dump into a grain bin.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As I recall, each grain bin held about 100 bushel of grain.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>A threshing crew usually consisted of at least two men placing sheaves on the table of the thresher, on feeding the thresher, one handling the grain as it came from the mill, one at the tail of the mill forking the straw up to the loft, and two in the loft stowing straw under the shed roof.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>None of the work was easy but I am sure that the dirtiest work was at the tail of the mill or stowing the straw in the loft and under the shed roof.</p>
