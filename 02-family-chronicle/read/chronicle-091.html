	<p>Thanks
	to Tina Newton for this photo of “The Watlings 5”: James A.,
	Jane (Glendenning), Ernest, Janet (Godfrey) and George.  Date
	uncertain but probably mid-1950’s.

	<h1 align="justify">“Twitchin
	 logs”</h1>
	<p align="justify" style="font-weight: normal"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify" style="font-weight: normal">Reading
	W. D. Hamilton’s book on th<u>e
	Old North Esk</u>
	reminded me of  terms used in lumbering.  While my woods work was
	limited to cutting our winter’s wood or a bit extra for sale, my
	father, like many New Brunswickers, had lumbered   in New Hampshire
	and probably Maine.  Several of my brothers also had spent the
	winter in the woods mostly up the Miramichi.</p>
	<p align="justify" style="font-weight: normal"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify" style="font-weight: normal">Based
	on Hamilton’s book and my own knowledge, there were “choppers”
	who felled trees and, in earlier days, squared the timber 
	</p>
	<p align="justify" style="font-weight: normal"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify" style="font-weight: normal">with
	their axes; “swampers” who cleared roads or paths to move the
	logs; “teamsters” who moved the logs using oxen or horses; logs
	were “twitched” meaning that they were dragged individually from
	where they were felled to where the sled was stationed; “yarding”
	meant that they were twitched to a common area, a yard, where they
	were piled for later transportation; one used a chain for twitching
	with the chain fastened to the log directly or using a set of grips
	– like heavy ice tongs which dug deeper when the hauling was
	heavy.</p>
	<p align="justify" style="font-weight: normal"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify" style="font-weight: normal">Logs
	often had to be “skidded” which meant using skids as ramps in
	order to pile logs on top of each other.  We also used skids to put
	heavy logs onto the sleds.   In a yard, logs were piled on top of
	each other with runners or smaller pieces between layers.  Skids
	would be placed between the log on the ground and the top of the
	load forming a ramp.  A “piling chain” was placed around the log
	and over the load and attached to a horse on the other side of the
	sled.  As the horse walked forward, the log was rolled on to the top
	of the pile.  Occasionally, the horse walked too far and pulled the
	log over to the ground on the other side of the sled.</p>
	<p align="justify" style="font-weight: normal"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify" style="font-weight: normal">Chopping
	was done with a “double bitter”, an axe sharpened on both faces.
	 A poleaxe had only one face and could be used for driving a wedge. 
	Some pole axes had a knob-like projection on the end away from the
	cutting face.</p>
	<p align="justify" style="font-weight: normal"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify" style="font-weight: normal">Of
	course, one sometimes needed a wedge to nudge the tree in the
	direction of fall.  Ours were made of steel, however, sometimes with
	a big tree and a heavy lean, a wooden wedge was made on the spot
	from an available piece of hardwood.  Another trick to felling a
	tree leaning in the wrong direction, was to cut a notch as high as
	one could reach and use a short stick for better leverage. 
	Sometimes a peavey was used for extra leverage.<br />
<br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify" style="font-weight: normal">A
	peavey was useful as a lever and using the dog to cant or turn a log
	so that it would fit better.  A pick pole (pike pole?) was a slender
	pole with a sharp metal end, like pikes used by knights in battle,
	used when rafting to manipulate logs.  Canthooks would also have
	been used to move logs in a millpond.</p>
	<p align="justify" style="font-weight: normal"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify" style="font-weight: normal">The
	term “can’t hook” was used but not common.  My brothers tell
	me it was another name for a peavey.  The use of the term was
	usually accompanied by a story of a woods crew that sent the newest
	member of the crew back to the house to get a cant hook.  In the
	story, the young man returned with a “humble cow – because it
	can’t hook.</p>

	Fulfilling the Dream</u>
	by Patricia Hubbard’s reports on a couple of meetings held in 1933
	to discuss economic development in Northumberland County.  Delegates
	to the second meeting from Black River Agricultural society, #103,
	were E. A. Glendenning, Sinclair Williston and Archie MacNaughton.</p>

	and the Bear</u> can
	be found on the internet.  I should have thought of that.  I’ll
	not repeat them here.  I also found the <u>Wreck

	and other poems I learned as a boy.  Thanks, Donald.

	<h1>A
	Running Pole</h1>
	<p style="font-weight: normal"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="font-weight: normal">A
	running pole was as long, slender pole, with a metal end used to put
	up or change a forker line for handling hay.  A special scissor-like
	hook holding a pulley was placed on the end of the pole and pushed
	up against a rafter in the roof of the barn over the hay mow.  When
	the hook “bit” into the rafter, the pole was removed leaving a
	pulley hanging.   The hooks could be moved depending on where the
	hay was to be stowed.  To move the hooks, one used a running pole.</p>
