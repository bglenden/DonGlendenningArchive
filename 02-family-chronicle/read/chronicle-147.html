	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">In
	preparation for winter, I was doing some yard work including cutting
	back my southernwood at the corner of the house.  It reminded me of
	a similar bush in front of my home at Little Branch.</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">A
	small southernwood plant grew by the walk close to the front door
	and many people admired it as they walked past. A particular admirer
	was Alex Newton.  He usually bent over, picked a few leaves and
	crushed them in his hand each time he passed.  He loved the smell of
	southernwood - as do I.</p>

	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">While
	in Black River recently, I met informally with a number of people
	interested in Black River genealogy.  During the conversation,
	mention was made of a Baptist church in Black River.  The date is
	unknown but Ernie MacLean believes it stood on the present site of
	St. Paul’s Presbyterian Church.  Ken Glendenning was aware of it
	but thought that it was on a site directly across the road from St.
	Paul’s Church.</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Furthermore,
	it was Ernie’s recollection that the land was given for the
	Baptist Church by a MacDonald.  While I have not checked land
	transfer records, it is my understanding that the land for St.
	Paul’s Presbyterian Church was given by Jack Gibson</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">On
	occasion, I’ve heard the story that there were graves in the
	wooded area just behind the Presbyterian Church; I am told that a
	number of people have gone looking but so far no graves were found.</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">While
	in Canobie recently I had a conversation with Danny Glendenning, a
	first cousin once removed – during which the meaning of “removed”
	arose.  Here is my understanding.</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Danny’s
	father, George, and I are first cousins because our fathers were
	brothers.  Danny is my first cousin once removed; Danny and my son,
	Brian, would be second cousins.  Danny’s children and Brian’s
	children would be third cousins.  And so it goes.</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Uncle
	Harry Glendenning often said that we were 49<sup>th</sup>
	cousins – that would be well down the line.</p>

	Art Mills sent a note
	recently in which he mentioned Clifford Adams.  Art said:</p>

	… <i>Cliff (Adams) was our
	School Bus driver, he was the most patient man I have encountered.
	The noise some days on the Bus was un-believable, and Cliff would
	not only tolerate but&nbsp;would seem to enjoy it as long as he was
	included in the joke, or included in whatever was going on.   One
	day my poor mother was horrified to answer the door and find Cliff
	standing there,” Is Arthur not going to school&nbsp; today” I
	was of course reading a sports book not a school book, the latter
	might have avoided a strong lecture.</i></p>

	fertilizer and good workmanship, how to improve the fertility and
	productiveness of the soil.  The work was carried on under
