	<p><b>John
	Franklin Glendenning (December 14, 1919 – June 21, 1986)</b></p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>John
	was born at Little Branch shortly after the family returned to
	Canada.  He attended the Little Branch School probably for 7 or 8
	years, and then he worked on the farm.  Dad had not been well for a
	number of years so Walter and John did the farm work.   
	</p>

</p>
	<p align="center"><b>John
	Glendenning and Marjorie Watling - Undated</b></p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>John
	and Walter hauled fish from Hardwicke to Chatham, cut hardwood on
	the “ridge” and delivered it to Loggieville and Chatham.  One
	day they would go to  Hardwicke or Baie St. Anne (including Fred
	Savoie’s) and bring fish back to the Branch; the next day, they
	delivered the fish to Chatham for $5.00 per ton (two box-sled
	loads).  They went to the woods and cut and split a cord of hardwood
	and the next day delivered it to Loggieville or Chatham for $5.00
	including the cost of the wood.   
	</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>John
	worked hard and put in long hours.  He expected everyone to do their
	bit whether it was bringing in the wood for the stove, doing barn
	chores, going to the woods in winter, making hay in summer, etc.  It
	was expected and you did it.  But he was also 
	</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>very
	generous to people needing help.    
	</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>In
	the late 1930’s John, along with some other young men from Black
	River including Tom Harper, Theodore Fowlie, took an agricultural
	course in Newcastle.  The course included practical farm mechanics,
	agriculture, book keeping, general mechanics and woodworking.  As
	part of the course, John made a beautiful birch desk, which he
	finished in  walnut.  I also remember that he learned a new
	technique for killing chickens.  I believe that it was then or
	shortly thereafter, that John rigged up a wind generator on the roof
	of the barn which would charge a battery and provide light.</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>One
	winter, November I believe, he and Brydone Weeks (Brydone was home
	on leave, probably before he went overseas) built a tractor out of
	an Oakland front end (a car that belonged to Alex MacDonald) and a
	Godferson rear end (a truck used by the A&amp;R Loggie Co) – and
	they did this in Walter’s old shed without the aid of welding and
	cutting equipment (or heat). The tractor had two transmissions.  The
	tractor was very powerful but the too heavy for soft ground.</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>During
	the winter of 1945-46, and perhaps winters previous to this, John,
	Ken and Norm all worked in the woods for Hubert Matchett of Sunny
	Corner.  They would be gone all week and I did the barn work.</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>As
	a young lad going on 17, I went to work on the boats in Chatham
	loading pulp and pit props.  (I am sure that I got my first job
	based on the reputation of John, Ken and Norm.)  One day we were
	storing 8-foot props down in the hold.  They are heavy enough anyway
	but these were also moldy; I was struggling and John knew it.  John
	said, “Let me take that one, Donald”.  And it happened many
	times.  
	</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>For
	a number of years John went from farm to farm along the Miramichi
	pressing hay, first with a horse powered hay press but later with a
	press operated off a tractor.  (When pressing hay at home, it was my
	job to keep the horse moving and to prevent it from grabbing at the
	hay when it went past the end of the bundle.)  Bundles of hay
	weighed between 80 to 120 pounds.  John worked all around Black
	River, Napan, Barnaby River, Cains River, etc.  For a number of</p>

	<p align="center" style="page-break-after: avoid"><b>John
	- undated</b></p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>years,
	John owned a 3-ton Dodge truck, which I believe he bought from
	Hubert Matchett, and trucked pulp, pit props, gravel, lime,
	fertilizer, hay and Christmas trees.</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>John
	met Mary Edna Bessie Watling when she attended a service at St.
	Paul’s with her cousin, Millie MacDonald.  He took Mary back to
	Point Aux Carr that night.  John and Mary were married at the Branch
	on January 27, 1944 and lived at the Branch for a while.  John and
	Mary had four children, Margaret, Franklin, Jean and George.</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>The
	day of, or day before, the wedding, John went in town to do some
	last minute shopping.  It was raining and the roads were icy.  An
	RCMP vehicle went through a stop sign and clipped John’s truck.  
	</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>In
	1946-47 John and Mary built a new house on the Bob MacLean property
	and in the spring of 1948 opened a store in their living room.  In
	1968 they built a new store nearer the road and put in gas tanks. 
	John was very entrepreneurial selling groceries, flour, feed,
	plumbing, furnaces and anything else to make a buck.</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>John
	received his call for military service and, I believe, went to
	Fredericton for a physical.  He had very poor eyesight and was
	turned down.  He probably would not have had to serve anyway,
	because farming was an essential service and he was needed at home. 
	Ken and Norm were already in the Service and I was too young to take
	over the responsibility of farming.  
	</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>When
	Ken and Norm were in the service, I was the only one around to help
	with the farm work.  Since Dad died when I was very young, you might
	say that I learned to work under John’s direction.  I recall going
	to the woods in the winter, sitting on the bob-sled and on the load
	of wood on the way home, building loads of loose hay and poisoning
	potato bugs early in the morning to take advantage of a heavy dew. 
	John was the only one of the boys who would sing while driving to
	and from the fields or woods – I especially remember him singing
	familiar hymns.</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>Many
	of the older people in Black River will remember the 1939 Ford
	half-ton truck that, as I recall, John purchased from Bonnie
	Flanagan.  It was a far cry from the old Model A.  The truck had
	wooden cab on the back and John would take people to town on
	Saturday night when the stores were open.  There could be a 10-12
	people in the back.  I think that he charged one dollar.  The last
	thing before leaving town, he would drive up Water Street and past
	Ben’s Canteen to see if anyone needed a lift home.  
	</p>
	<p>John
	and Mary liked to visit family and friends around the Miramichi and
	Bathurst.  John and Mary, with Margaret and Jeannie, made their
	first trip to Florida over Christmas of 1958.  Carol and I went with
	them to help with the driving.  Later, they managed to visit Florida
	for a month most winters always stopping to see family and friend in
	Florida and on the way.  When our children were small and we visited
	Black River, John always had gave the kids a candy or some change
	just as we were about to drive away.</p>
