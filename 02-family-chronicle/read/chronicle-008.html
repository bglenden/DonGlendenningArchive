<div class="reader-summary">Eighth Family Chronicle (May 30, 1999) documents Little Branch Post Office history through archival records showing postmasters from 1871-1928, confirming Don&#x27;s parents Elmer and Jane Glendenning served November 1, 1914 to August 1, 1916. Notes that Aunt Tine MacKenzie likely ran the post office in the Jessie MacDonald house 1902-1907 (between her husbands Tom Adams and John MacKenzie). Information about a separate Watling Post Office (1911-1928). Clarifies the Daly/Daley name change (Carson Daley changed spelling after WWII). Provides detailed genealogy of Aunt Tine&#x27;s families: children from Tom Adams marriage (James, Jubal Willard, Gertrude) and from John MacKenzie marriage (Norman, Jean, Edith). Corrects earlier error: Alex MacDonald&#x27;s first wife was Ethel MacTavish (not Catherine McGraw), second wife Beatrice Shuttleworth. Discusses cemetery records and the Alexander MacDonald property division.</div>

<p><b>Little Branch Post Office</b><b></b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The Archives has a database, searchable through the Internet, on post offices and postmasters. In checking the Little Branch Post Office, I found the following:</p>
<p><b>Postmaster		Dates				Cause of vacancy</b><b></b></p>
<p>Alexander Cameron	1871-11-01 <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>to 1876-03-30	Resignation</p>
<p>John MacNaughton	1876-08-01 to 1883-08-20	Resignation, closed</p>
<p>Alexander Cameron	1884-11-01<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>to 1887-03-22	Resignation</p>
<p><span class="Apple-converted-space">           </span>(Re-opened)</p>
<p>George Fowlie		1887-09-01 to 1899-10-02	Death</p>
<p>Mrs. Marjorie Fowlie	1900-02-01 to 1903-09	Change in site</p>
<p>Jubal Watling		1903-12-01 to 1910-12-02	Resignation</p>
<p>A.E. MacDonald	1911-03-01<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>to 1914-08-10	Resignation</p>
<p>Elmer Glendenning	1914-11-01<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>to 1916-08-01	Resignation</p>
<p>Donald MacNaughton	1916-09-01 to 1928-10-31	Closed</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Although Jubal Watling was the Postmaster, I believe that Aunt Tine MacKenzie ran the Post Office in the Jessie MacDonald house. (Where Norman Glendenning now lives).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This would be, as I understand it, between 1902 when her first husband, Tom Adams, died and 1907 when she married John MacKenzie<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I always thought that Dad and Mum ran the Post Office but didn<span>=</span>t have any proof.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The above information confirms my understanding.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The dates are interesting because we know that Mum and Dad were in Tennessee prior to this (1911 to 1912 or more likely until 1913) The next dates we have are New Haven, Conn. in 1917 where Lillian was born on January 8.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It looks as though they may have returned to Little Branch between jobs. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Watling Post Office</b><b></b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>There was Post Office named Watling which opened in 1911 and closed in 1928.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The Postmasters were Donald Watling, A. H. McKay and A. D. Watling</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Daley/Daley</b><b></b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Thanks to Carson Daley, for the following information:</p>
<p>the original name was Daly but he (Carson) changed his name to Daley after he left the service at the end of WW2<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This explains why Herbert spells his name, Daly and Carson spells his name, Daley</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Grandfather Glendenning<span>=</span>s sister, Margaret, married Richard Daly not Irvin Daly as I earlier thought.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Richard Daly married Elizabeth Dempsey and they had eight children. His wife died and Margaret Glendenning moved in to look after the children.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She was 20 years younger than Richard.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She and Richard also had eight children.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>After Richard died, Margaret married Arthur Jagoe and I believe is buried with him in the Stonehaven Cemetery. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>One of Richard and Margaret<span>=</span>s sons, Irvin married Katie Branch and they had three children, Annie, Leslie and Austen.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Leslie married Cora Knowles; their children are Herbert, Carson and Earl</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Aunt Tine</b><span><b>=</b></span><b>s Family</b><b></b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Thanks mostly to Edith Schickel for the following information:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>James Adams	born about 1896</p>
<p>Jubal Willard Adams born Sept. 17, 1900</p>
<p>Gertrude Adams <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>1891-1932</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Norman MacKenzie Aug 9,1908 -Mar 27 1948</p>
<p>Jean MacKenzie Dec. 29 1910 - May 21 1963</p>
<p>Edith MacKenzie born Oct 11 1912</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Error</b><b></b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I found the following error in information which I distributed earlier.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Alex MacDonald<span>=</span>s first wife was Ethel MacTavish not Catherine McGraw.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>His second wife was Beatrice Shuttleworth</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>John MacDonald and Elspeth Jardine</b><b></b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I find it strange that we have no birth or death dates for our Great grandparents, Mr. and Mrs. John MacDonald.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If anyone has dates or other information, please let me know.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Cemetery Information</b><b></b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Increasingly, names on tombstones in cemeteries are being copied and distributed, usually for a fee.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Recently, I purchased a copy of cemetery listings for all Protestant cemeteries in the Bathurst area.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A similar listing is available for Roman Catholic cemeteries.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I also have a listing of all names in the Black River Cemetery.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Lists can usually be found through the local historical or genealogy group.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Move to Little Branch</b><b></b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Based on the above Post Office information, Jubal and Grace Watling moved from Upper Black River to Little Branch on or before December 1, 1903</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
