	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">Dad’s
	sister, Venetia, married Uncle Bob Doring.  They lived in Falmouth
	Foreside, Maine, which is just outside Portland and close to the
	area where the factory outlet stores, including, LL Bean, are
	located.  The

	<p align="justify">Wauchula
	Herald Advocate carried the following item on July 8, 1960</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	Venetia Glendenning Doring, widow of R. L. Doring, died Sunday in
	Bowling Green after a long illness.  She was 87.</i></p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	<p align="justify"><i>Mrs.
	Doring was a native of New Brunswick, Canada.  She lived in Bowling
	Green since 1915, coming there from Portland, Maine.</i></p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	<p align="justify"><i>Survivors
	include one son, Walter G Doring, Bowling Green; Miss Verna Doring,
	Bradenton; two brothers, Ray Glendenning, New Brunswick, and Guy W.
	Glendenning, Bowling Green.</i></p>

	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">We
	know the precise date that my mother landed in Portland (January
	24,1908); we cannot say the same for my father.  We know, however,
	that he and one or more of his brothers ran a cartage business in
	Portland prior to 1910.  We also know that some of his first cousins
	by the name of Henry had moved to the Portland area prior to 1870
	and that their mother, his Great Aunt Mary Anne (Harley) Henry moved
	there after her husband died (1970).  Dad also had first cousins by
	the name of Knowles living in the US but I do not know the time
	period.  I believe that Lillian stayed with them when she went to
	Boston in 1933.</p>

	<h6 align="justify" style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">Changing
	Times</h6>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">Arthur
	Mills has done considerable work on the Mills (originally Milne)
	family tree. Recently he shared some notes on the old home built in
	1870.  The home was constructed on part of the original grant of 300
	acres by King George 3<sup>rd</sup>
	to Arthur’s Great Grandfather, James Mills, on September 12, 1818.
	 Art has a copy of the original document.</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">Art’s
	father, Jasper Mills, was a fisherman for over 50 years, fishing
	herring in the spring, salmon from June to mid-August, oysters from
	September to November and smelts from December to March (ice
	conditions permitting).  Jasper was one of the early fishermen to
	drift for salmon – that is to fasten a string of gill nets to the
	boat and to drift in the Miramichi Bay overnight.  He also had a
	contract with Canada Department of Transport to provide, lay and
	take up navigation buoys in the area.  His contract required 25-30
	cedar spars (painted red or black annually), five steel 45-gallon
	drums painted red or black, and hardwood bushes to mark the narrow
	channels.</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<h6 align="justify" style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">Uncommon
	Name</h6>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">When traveling, I usually check
	the name Glendenning in the local phone directory; it is not unusual
	to find it. Lately I have been looking for the name Watling; that is
	a rare name indeed.</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify"><b>Miramichers Away</b></p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">Art
	Mills and I had a conversation about what we should do with our
	genealogy materials and even artifacts with a Miramichi connection. 
	It may be of interest to others who originated in the Miramichi.  We
	are not aware of any museum or other body with an interest.  If
	readers know of such an organization, please let me know and I will
	mention it in an upcoming issue.</p>

	<p align="justify" style="page-break-after: avoid"><b>Washboard Pie</b></p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">Washington
	pie was a regular dessert at home especially when entertaining.  It
	consisted of two layers of white cake with a filling between.  Seems
	to me that the filling was either raspberry or strawberry preserves
	but could have been a lemon filling as well.  Earl Taylor used tease
	Mum by calling it “washboard pie”</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify" style="page-break-after: avoid"><b>Earth Quakes</b></p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>According to my sister, Lillian, an earthquake
	was felt in Black river in 1925.  There was a more recent one but I
	do not recall the year.  Ken was visiting at John’s and John went
	into the barn for something.  While he was in the barn, the quake
	was felt.  The metal siding on the barn banged as though someone was
	striking it with a piece of two by four.</p>

	<p align="justify">A
	tornado struck in Upper Black river, I do not know the year, but it
	damaged the school.
