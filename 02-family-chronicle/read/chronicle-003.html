<p><b>Watling Descendant’s Gathering</b><b></b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>On Saturday evening, November 15, about 20 people (I didn’t really count) with Watling interests and/or family connections gathered in the basement of St. Paul’s Church Black River, to talk about family tree matters.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Among things which I remember are the following:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>George Loggie said that Alexander MacDonald spent the first winter in Point Aux Carr after coming from Cape Breton</p>
<p>Ernie MacLean said that the original Alexander MacDonald grant is the land now owned by Norman Glendenning and Neil Watling.</p>
<p>The original home was situated above Norman Glendenning=s barn near the old apple orchard.</p>
<p>Teddy Fowlie said, as I recall, that his father, when a boy on the way to school, would stop at a MacDonald’d home in the field above Norman=s to get warm.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This, I believe, was in the field where an old pump was (still is ?).</p>
<p>I believe that the Alexander MacDonald property was divided between his son, John, married to Elspeth Jardine, getting the east half and his daughter, Jessie, getting the West half. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>John’s half went to Jubal and Grace (MacDonald) Watling.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Jubal left his property to James A and Ernest Watling; James bought out Ernest’s share. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This information is based on hearsay not on research.</p>
<p>When<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Jessie died in 1912, her property appears to have gone to her nephew, Alexander MacDonald from whom Elmer Glendenning bought it in 1914.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Bertha Glendenning</b><b></b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>We seem to have lost all connections with Frank Glendenning daughter Bertha (Glendenning) Crocker’s family.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>According to my information, Bertha (1905 - 1974) married Clayton Crocker (Died 1975) They had two children, Joan and Franklin.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Joan did not marry but worked for her father and, after he died, in a retail store.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I talked with Joan once when passing through Portland.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>By then she was retired and living in the old family cottage (winterized) at Sebago Lake.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I sent her some family tree information which was returned unopened.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Later I tried to phone, but she could not be reached<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Franklin is married and lives in Stone Mountain, Georgia.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As I recall, he has 2 children.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A recent letter to the address given to me by Joan, was returned marked "Insufficient Address”.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Information Gaps</b><b></b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>There are many information gaps in terms of the Watling Family tree chart.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In particular, I am looking for family, if any, of the following:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The children, if any, of Janet MacNaughton and John Edge</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The following children of William Watling and Mary MacNaughton:</p>
<p>Sandy</p>
<p>Emma married William Dickson</p>
<p>Jubal</p>
<p>William</p>
<p>Mary Anne married John Dickson</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The children, if any, of Catherine MacNaughton and George Dick</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The following children of Jubal Watling and Susan Leach:</p>
<p>Mary Anne Watling married to William Maxwell</p>
<p>Children of Emma Watling and William Eddy</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Peters</b><b></b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I am grateful to Joy (Glendenning) Winton for additional information about the Peters side of the family.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Grandmother Elizabeth (Peters) Glendenning was the daughter of John Peters and Jane Sealy.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Other children of that family were:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Norman who married Henrietta Forbes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Their children include Bedford, William, Ola,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Catherine, Reginald, Lila, Eunice and Laura.</p>
<p>Robert who married Annie Jagoe and had two children, John and Eva.</p>
<p>Susan who married John Daley and had three children, James, Hart and Wilfred</p>
<p>Jane who married Henry Knowles and had five children: Rufus, Sam, Evelyn, Lillian and Elizabeth.</p>
<p>Bedford married Emma Sargent.</p>
<p>Esther who married Frank Miller</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Jardine</b><b></b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>As a result of my last visit to NB, I have some additional information about the Jardine connection.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I know that my great grandmother was a Jardie but I am still trying to sort out just where she fits in with the other Jardines.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is becoming clearer but I still have a abit more to do.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Brian Glendenning</b><b></b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>My son, Brian, had an Email message from a Brian Glendenning who lives in Australia.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>No connection as far as I can tell.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Other Glendennings</b><b></b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The following information comes from notes provided by Lawrence W McGill of Seattle Washington.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He is descended from Glendinnings who came from Mousewald near Dumfries, Scotland and settled in New Brunswick.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>John Glendinning married Janet Davidson.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They had four children all born in Scotland.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>James was born in 1797 and died in Saint John, New Brunswick in 1846.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>George was born in 1798 and died in Truemanville, Nova Scotia in 1870.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Sarah was born in 1800.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She married Andrew Haugh and died in Barony, New Brunswick about 1880.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Thomas was born in 1801 and lived in New York. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>It appears that John=s wife Janet Davidson, died and John then married Jean Johnston.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They had a number of children, all born in Scotland.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>David was born in 1802 and died in Oxford, Nova Scotia about 1880.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Janet was born in 1812.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>John was born in 1814 and died in Nitheville,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Dunedin, New Zealand in 1900.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Anne was born in 1817.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I reviewed the information which Lawrence McGill provided but found no connection to my Great-grandfather, John Glendinning who came to Canada in 1830.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>It is interesting to note, however, that that branch also went through a name change from Glendinning to Glendenning.</p>
