	<p align="justify">It
	is interesting that Dad’s name sometimes appears as Alton Elmer
	and other times as Elmer Alton Glendenning.  Although I have not
	seen a birth certificate, my earliest references are to Elmer Alton
	Glendenning.</p>
	<p align="justify" style="page-break-after: avoid"><b>Mission
	Bands</b></p>
	<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
	<p align="justify">Mission
	Bands were church groups for children.  Statistics for St. Stephen’s

	<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
	<p align="justify" style="page-break-after: avoid"><b>Sleds
	and Sleighs</b></p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>The above
	photo reminded me of the different kinds of sleds around home. 
	Every home had a box sled, shown in photo, which was drawn by one
	horse and was the “working sled” of the family.  The height of
	the box varied but, as I recall, ours was about 30 inches tall and
	it would have two or three benches for seats.  A box sled would haul
	a half a ton of smelts, a half a cord of wood, a pig to be bred,
	results of one’s shopping in Loggieville and friends and family to
	church.  Norman, and likely Kenneth, hauled fellow students to
	school in the Bay du Vin church and later to the Miramichi High
	School.  He would carry hay for the horse and Goymer Williston or
	Harrison Smith let him stable the horse while at school for the day.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>On long
	trips or cold days, hay or straw would be placed in the bottom and
	we would cover ourselves with blankets, a buffalo robe or even the
	horse blankets to keep warm.  Sometimes stones would be heated to
	help keep us warm.  If one got too cold, one got off and walked.  On
	a stormy day, the driver still had to stand in the cold.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>We also
	had a set of bobsleds hauled by a team of horses although there were
	light bobsleds pulled by one horse as well.  Bobsleds were two
	sleds.  The trailing sled was hooked to the leading sled by crossed
	chains – that is the right front of the trailing sled was hooked
	to the left rear of the leading sled and the left front to the right
	rear.  The rear sled was like a trailer.  Both sleds had bunks with
	the one on the front able to swivel thus allowing the leading sled
	to turn.  
	</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>Bobsleds
	were used for hauling logs and firewood in long lengths.  (Firewood
	was cut into firewood length at the house) wood to the river for the
	spring drive or, later, in hauling to the side of a road to be
	picked up by a truck.  When used commercially for hauling logs,
	extra long bunks were used so that larger loads could be hauled.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>Sleighs
	came in many shapes and sizes and were hauled by one horse.  Some
	were fancy while others, like the one in the last issue of the
	Family Chronicle were quite utilitarian.  Sleighs, if you had one,
	were used for funerals and courting.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>In the
	summer we had a drag sled sometimes know, I believe, as a stone
	boat.  Drag sleds were hauled by a horse and were used to haul heavy
	objects short distances such as few bags of grain from the grain
	shed to the barn, stones to the side of the field, etc.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>Finally,
	there were hand sleds that, as the name implies, were pulled by
	hand.  We had two, a small one and one known as “John’s sled”.
	 I wonder if John made that sled the year he took the course in
	Newcastle?  Hand sleds were used for light hauling around the farm
	such as to pick up the groceries at the corner when Ken arrived home
	on the bus, haul wood from the pile to the door.  
	</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>Of course,
	the fun use was for coasting which we did on the hill towards the
	school.  On cold, crisp, moonlight nights, I often think of George
	and I coasting on the hill.  I mentioned in an earlier letter that
	the Little Branch school did not have a pump therefore water was
	carried in a pail from our house to the school.  Usually two
	students were assigned the task each day.  I recall filling a pail
	at our place, putting it between us on the handsled and coasting
	down the hill and into the school yard.  Whatever water was left, we
	carried into the school.</p>
