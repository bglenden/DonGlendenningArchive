  Issue 81 &middot; Oct 13, 2004
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Don memorializes Mary (Godfrey) Williston (1911-2004), who taught at Little Branch School for three years and boarded with Uncle Jim and Aunt Kate Watling. He recalls her as a strict but good teacher. The issue includes Don&#x27;s personal anecdotes about picking mushrooms as a child and trying to identify whether they were toadstools, and a nostalgic piece on clothing progression from two-piece summer suits (via sister Grace from Boston) through bib overalls to long pants purchased for his father&#x27;s 1938 funeral. These pieces reveal Don&#x27;s intimate recall of rural childhood and his family&#x27;s evolving circumstances.</div>

	I am reminded of picking
	mushrooms when I was a youngster.  For some reason, I recall picking
	them on the way home from taking the cows to the Finno” field –
	the one at Finno’s turn.  At that time the land on the back side
	of the road was an open, un-cultivated field.  It was a good place
	to find mushrooms.  Seems to me that Dad always checked to see that
	we had not brought toadstools – then Mum fried them.</p>

	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Young
	boys wore short pants.  My earliest recollections are of two-piece
	summer suits in white or yellow that my sister Grace brought home
	from Boston.  Nothing doing, in the middle of the night I was
	wakened to try on these new summer outfits.  The tops and bottoms
	were held together by buttons.</p>

	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Bib
	overalls come next with the pocket in the bib and slot to hold a
	pencil.  I wanted jeans without bibs but probably got them as a
	teenager or nearly so.  My first long pants, as I recall, were
	purchased for Dad’s funeral (1938).  As I recall, there was some
	discussion at the time as to whether I should have short pants or
	long pants.  They were purchased at Sadler’s in Chatham</p>

	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">As
	youngsters, we went barefoot all summer.  I can still remember one
	episode where I split my big toe when I struck a “stump” in the
	lane.  (I think it was a gatepost that had been replaced but not
	completely removed. (Getting us to wash our feet before we went to
	bed was always a struggle.)Presumably we wore shoes to church
	although I cannot recall.  When we graduated to work boots, we had
	knitted woolen socks – summer and winter.  I cannot ever remember
	having sneakers.  (To be continued)</p>
