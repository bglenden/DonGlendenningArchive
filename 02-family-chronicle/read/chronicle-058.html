	<p align="justify">An
	undated photo, taken in 1937 or earlier, of my father, Elmer, and
	some of his siblings.  From left to right: Raymond, married to Hilda
	Ellis, lived in Canobie, N.B.; Maude, married to Jim Cormier, lived
	in Canobie, N.B.: Guy, married to Hazel Stults, lived in Bowling
	Green, Florida; Elmer, married to Jane Watling lived in Little
	Branch, New Brunswick; Chip, married Louise Ellis, lived in Canobie,
	N.B.; Minnie, married Ed Weeks, lived in Mill Neck, Long Island. 
	Missing are Venetia, married to Bob Doring, lived in Bowling Green,
	Florida; Margaret, married to Lucas Marsen, lived in Boothbay
	Harbour and; Ray married to Hilda Ellis, lived in Canobie.</p>

	Photos</b></p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">I’ve
	tried to figure out why there were photos of my older siblings and
	none of the younger ones except me.  My conclusion is that while Mum
	and Dad lived in the US, they took photos to send back to Grandma
	and Grandpa.  After moving back, grandparents didn’t need photos
	because they lived next door.  Later, when I cam along, Grace and
	later Lillian had moved to the US so they took photos of me to send.
	 At least that is my theory. 
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify" style="page-break-after: avoid"><b>Meals</b></p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">Although
	I often worked at the “thrasher’ at 
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">home,
	I never worked a “thrasher” elsewhere.  I spoke, therefore, with
	brothers, Norman and Kenneth about their recollections.  A Threshing
	crew consisted of 8 or more men.  At least one meal was provided and
	sometimes two meals if the crew worked late to finish up.</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">The
	crew started at 8:00 am. Dinner was about 11:30.  Meals might vary
	but usually included meat (roast beef or maybe pork), potatoes,
	carrots maybe turnip, bread, with tea (cannot remember ever having
	coffee) and dessert.  Jean says that apple pie was a favourite.  One
	of Mum’s regular desserts when there was a crowd at the house was
	gingerbread with whipped cream.  The second meal, if there were one,
	would be about 4:00 pm.  Many times the work was done by 4:00 pm or
	so and a second meal was not necessary. 
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify" style="page-break-after: avoid"><b>My
	first Movie</b></p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">Movie
	theatres were late in arriving in Black River.  I know there wasn’t
	any in the 1930’s and I do not recall any even when I graduated
	from high school.  I do, however, remember my first movie.</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">In
	the summer of 1936, July I believe, Dad and Walter drove the old
	Model A to Boston to bring Grace home.  She was married on August
	26,1936 in Black River.  Elinor and I were taken along for the ride.
	 We stopped at Uncle Leonard Glendenning’s in Palermo, Maine; we
	also stayed with Aunt Margaret Marsen in Boothbay Harbour.  Uncle
	Luke had a new car and took us to the circus.  It had curved not
	square lines like the Model A.</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">We stayed with Uncle Frank and
	Aunt Lil Glendenning in Portland.  In fact, I may have stayed there
	while Dad and Walter went on to Boston to pick up Grace.  While at
	Uncle Frank’ s I went to my first movie.  Did Elinor take me?  I
	cannot recall.</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">The
	movie was a comedy in black and white and, as I recall, was Abbot
	and Costello or at least that kind of movie.  It may have even been
	silent.  Part of it involved some house repair and I remember the
	feathers from a feather mattress flying.  In another scene, one
	person was carrying a long piece of lumber out the glass door. 
	Several times he opened the door, went back and picked up the lumber
	and, by the time he got to the door the door had closed.  At the
	end, he opened the door, ran back and picked up the lumber, rushed
	to the door and poked the board through the glass.</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify"><b>Teaching
	a Calf to Drink</b></p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">I was part of a conversation a few days ago in
	which someone expressed surprise that calves had to be taught to
	drink from a bucket.  Well, calves seem to know how to get milk from
	a cow’s teat but not from a bucket.</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">As I recall, one put a bit of milk in a bucket,
	then you put the fingers of the right hand in the calf’s mouth. 
	When it started sucking on your fingers, you pushed its head down so
	that your fingers were in the milk.  It got milk when it sucked on
	your fingers.  Then you removed your fingers and the calf simply
	sucked the milk.  Simple, isn’t it.</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify"><b>Rev.
	McGregor</b></p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p>Before a
	church was built, Black River was served by itinerant ministers and
	missionaries.  Among the visiting ministers was the Rev. Dr. James
	McGregor, a Scot based in Pictou, Nova Scotia whose visits to a
	community usually lasted several days and even weeks and included
	preaching, praying, and religious conversations.   Rev. Patterson, a
	grandson, I believe, wrote a biography of McGregor and reported: 
	</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p style="margin-left: 0.5in">“<i><b>On
	the first and second visits to the Miramichi in 1797 and 1807, he
	preached and baptized at Black River, Bay du Vin, and on both sides
	of the Miramichi, up as far as the point, so called, at the junction
	of the North and South-west branches.  Those who recollect him
	remark his happy faculty in introducing religious conversation.”</b></i></p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>And
	further on:</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p style="margin-left: 0.5in">“<i><b>His being
	present at the induction of Mr. Thompson in 1817 is well
	remembered.”</b></i></p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify"><b>Covered
	Bridges</b></p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">In my day, Black River was served by three
	covered bridges.  The shortest, I believe was the one at Middle
	Black River (near the Cameron School).  The longest was the Victoria
	Bridge near the mouth of the river (near Hexham).The Branch Bridge
	was an in between size and like the Victoria Bridge had a long
	causeway leading up to it especially on the north side.</p>
