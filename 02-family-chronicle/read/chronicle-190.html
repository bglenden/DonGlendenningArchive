	<b>MacLaughlin driving wagon,
	early 1900’s</b></p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">The
	wagon pictured above was found on the second floor of the Gill
	Carriage shop in Eliotvale, PEI.  The wagon, although no nameplate
	was found, is believed to be manufactured by the MacLaughlin Company
	of Ontario (later the MacLaughlin Buick Motor Company) driving
	wagon. The wagon is owned by John Gill who, along with his father,
	was a carriage maker, ceasing the business sometime after WW2.  The
	wagon belonged to Mr. Gill’s brother and, John recalls, was
	imported by his brother from Ontario in the 1920’s.</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">The
	wagon, pictured above, reminds me of our light driving wagon when I
	grew up.  Some wagons had a solid back; ours, as I recall, had an
	open back like the one pictured above.  Ours also had a hinged cover
	on the portion of the box behind the seat to keep parcels out of
	sight but also to keep them dry</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Given
	the size of our family, for church, we usually traveled in an
	“express” wagon which would have been used commercially for
	delivering groceries and packages in towns and cities.  It was a
	stronger/heavier wagon and had two seats.</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><b>In
	Memoriam</b></p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">I
	found the following among my papers but have no idea how it came
	into my possession.  It is hand written on a lined legal size page. 
	At the bottom of the page is written,  “Written by Betty
	MacNaughton”; I assume that it was written on the death of her
	father, Donald MacNaughton, (1874-1935).  The writing reminds me of
	Aunt Kate Watling’s handwriting; she was a niece and a neighbour
	of Donald Macnaughton. and may well have transcribed a copy for my
	mother.</p>

	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">There
	were not many cars on Black River roads before WW2. Our car, a 1929
	Model A 2-door sedan, was “up on blocks” in the wagon shed when
	I first recall it.  The reason was simple; we were in the midst of a
	recession.  Up-on-blocks means that all four wheels were lifted off
	the ground to ensure that it wouldn’t be driven, but it also to
	protec the vehicle from the cold and damp creeping up from the
	ground and ruining the tires.</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">There
	were five boys in the family; we had one bicycle, Walter’s, among
	us.  We were glad when times improved and he was able to use the
	car.  The next bicycle came to our house when John purchased one for
	me in 1945.</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Schools
	were about four miles apart so many students walked two miles night
	and morning.</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Elinor,
	Ken and Norman often walked to high school in Bay du Vin; later they
	traveled by horse.  One would walk two miles or more to church
	Sunday morning only to walk back again in the evening for Young
	peoples meetings.</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">It
	was not unusual to walk a mile or more to the grocery store and
	carry groceries back with you; I know of people walking from the
	Branch to Loggieville, about 11 miles, but never did myself.  Also,
	the men in the winter would walk for miles into the woods camp on
	Sunday afternoon and home again on Friday night or Saturday.</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">I
	cannot ever remember being driven, or picked up, to visit a friend
	in the community; you walked or you didn’t go.</p>
