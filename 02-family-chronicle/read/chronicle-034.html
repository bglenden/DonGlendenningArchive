<p><b>The Family</b> <b>Chronicle</b><b></b></p>
<p>No.34										 <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>January 30, 2003</p>
<p><span><span class="Apple-converted-space">                                                                                                                                 </span>________________</span><span></span></p>
<p><b>Follow-up</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Following some items in Issue 31, Jack Wilson tells me that he purchased some items from a sale at the John W. MacNaughton property including a octagonal plant stand inscribed on the; under side “Fraser MacKay, June 22, 1944”.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I think that was the year Fraser graduated.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Plant stands were a standard shop project.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There are probably not many homes in Black River today without one.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If my memory serves me right, they were octagonal, eight and certainly no more than 10 inches across, had four legs and stood about 24 to 26 inches tall.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Most were finished with shellac and varnish; some may have been stained – usually walnut.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>My brother Ken reminded me that my little red tractor did not come from Santa after all.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was a gift from one of the “MacDonald Sisters” probably Frances and may have been a thank you for the milk which we delivered to them while they were in residence in Black River.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They lived in Portland but usually summered in the old home, the Ken MacDonald place, on the spot where Cameron Macdonald now lives.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>(Ken’s Hill originated from the fact that Ken MacDonald owned the property and lived nearby.)</p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>I appreciate hearing recently from Robin Farrell, a first Cousin once removed, (figure that out) now living with his family in Rochester, New York.)</p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>The Electric Iron</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>During the first years of their married life, Dad worked at construction sites, usually dam sites as far as I know.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Some of the sites had electricity, probably to power some of the equipment but also available to the homes where the families lived.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As a result, Mum had an electric iron among things stored in the closet at the head of the stairs (the equivalent of the attic in novels and movies).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Sometimes on a stormy wintry day, I was allowed to root around in the attic.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That’s where the electric iron was kept.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Before the advent of wrinkle free or wrinkle resistant fabric, most clothing required pressing.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>(Even men’s dress pants were pressed from time to time.)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Irons<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>for pressing usually came in sets of three and were warmed on the stovetop.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A detachable handle was used to change irons when a hot one was needed. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Ironing was a necessary and frequent task when raising a family of nine – and I understand that Walter always wore a white shirt when courting Agnes and he courted most nights of the week.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Anyway, with the arrival of electricity, the old iron was retrieved from the closet, plugged and provided a number of additional years of useful service.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Flinch</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>Flinch was a very popular game at our home.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Although I played it, I especially remember a crowd of young people, only the boys I think, gathered around our dining room table of an evening.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I remember the Harpers, Adams and our own crew and I think Roy and Win and others. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Flinch is played with one or more packs of cards; cards are numbered from one to 15.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>One has a hand, a flinch pile where you lay down a card at the end of your turn and a stack of cards from which players take new hands.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The objective is to get rid of your flinch pile first.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If you had a card in your flinch pile and did not play it, you were flinched – that is, the player who spotted it gave you a card from his pile.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I know that we played it at home, Venetia played it with her family, Ken and his family played it and probably others.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Flinch was first produced by the Flinch Card Company in Kalamazoo, Mich.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>in 1902.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Parker Brothers produced it under license from 1904, and later bought the rights.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was produced in Canada under license by Copp Clark Co. Ltd.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The Museum of Games at Waterloo University bought a copy of the game in 1979.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I’ve asked a number of people and Flinch seems to have been unique to our family.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My game was produced by Parker Brothers in Salem, Mass.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Doreen (Glendenning) Nicol suggested that the game came to us from my sister, Grace, who lived at one time in Salem and who probably sent it as a Christmas gift.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Makes sense.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Carol and I spent Christmas in Ottawa; I took my Flinch game along.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Carol, Doreen, Janet and I played Flinch – <b>and enjoyed it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span></b>I wonder if any readers remember the game.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Glendinning</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>There was a village on Megget Water near Langholm, Scotland named Glendinning; it was a center of antimony mining.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The village has disappeared.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Anyone interested can look it up on the web.</p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Vehicles</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Dad owned a Model T Ford; I do not remember it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Lillian thought that he bought it from McLennan’s garage in Chatham - in the corner of the park across from the Post Office?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The gun registry? <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Once, when bringing Grace home from Success Business College in Moncton, (Gladys MacNaughton also came up with them) he rolled the car at Gilbert’s Corner.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Gilberts Corner was the junction where the road from Moncton met the road north to Chatham.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Grace broke her wrist in the accident and Dad had some cuts and bruises.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Lillian went with Dad.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>On the way home also, someone tried to run Dad off the road – Lillian thought they were rum runners.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Dad pulled in to a store and phoned the RCMP in Newcastle.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Someone came, probably Bedford Peters, Dad’s cousin.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There were no sign of the people but Lillian rode back to Black River in the police car.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Later Dad purchased a 1929 Model A, two-door sedan from the Babineau (sisters, I believe) who owned the cinema in Chatham.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I remember it sitting in the wagon shed at the west end of the barn presumably it was in storage because money was scarce.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Walter and Dad cut wood up Bay du Vin River the winter they bought the car.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Later in the 1930’s it was taken out of storage and used around the farm by all the family except me.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Returning from a trip to Bathurst, Walter and Dad brought a half-ton of green cod, towed a trailer with two horses he bought, and had two geese on the trunk carrier on the rear.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I remember stories of Ken falling out on a turn and being held by Venetia until the car stopped, because fuel was gravity feed having to back up the Tabusintac Hill, Norm and Ken walking to the bottom of the Tabusintac Hill for water because Dad did not want to stop at the bottom in case he could get all the way to the top; raising the hood and seeing the red hot manifold when Walter had come home through deep snow, Norman taking out the back seat and bringing home 5 sheep, Elinor and I riding with Dad and his sister Venetia when he decided to show her the Mac Property (he was not a good driver). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Next we had a chocolate-brown, 1939 Ford half-ton that I think that John bought from Bonnie Flanagan.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Bonnie Flanagan lived just north of Kouchibouguac, Lakeville I think, and traveled around the country buying meat.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He was a very outgoing man.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>John always kept the truck in tip-top condition but we seemed to have had many problems with the fuel pump and brakes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Many a time I remember taking the truck to Carmen (?) Nevin’s Garage (or nevin and Golette?) in Chatham to be there when the garage opened at 8:00 am.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Once while haying in Napan, a property near Edith Bremner?, I was designated to take the truck in town for brake work.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As I came to MacDermiad's, they were unloading hay and the horse was crossing the road on the forker line.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I couldn't stop.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Fortunately, they tripped the load in the barn and the forker line dropped to the road and I rode over it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If it hadn’t dropped, I am not sure just what would have happened.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Homemade Tractor</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>Speaking of vehicles, my brother, John and Brydone, his brother-in-law, built a homemade tractor, I think just before Christmas, November maybe, of 1940.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>(Brydone was home on leave and they did the actual work in the old shed/barn at Walter’s.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I don’t think they had the benefit of a welder although they may have had some pieces welded in Chatham.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>My recollection is that the engine and frame was an Oakland car (Alex MacDonald’s car, maybe) and a Godferson rear end.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>(Didn’t A&amp;R Loggie Company use Godferson trucks?)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The tractor used a transmission from each.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>So if both were in reverse, the tractor went forward.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>There were two weaknesses, as I recall, it was very heavy and got mired easily.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>One could not work wet land or land early in the spring. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The other was the torque when in low gear, broke the bolts holding the transmissions together.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I remember the first time John drove it to the Branch (a wet, snowy, mean day) and I recall having a drive on it.</p>
