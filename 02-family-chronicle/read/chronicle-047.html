<p><b>Selkirk Settlers</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>My cottage is on a peninsula overlooking Orwell Bay where, 200 years ago, the Selkirk Settlers landed on PEI.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>These were not the only Selkirk settlers, but I believe that they were the first.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The notes that follow are based on an article in the Charlottetown Guardian on August 2, 2003.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Thomas Douglas, Earl of Selkirk, brought 800 settlers into this area in 1803.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Most of them came from the Isles of Skye and Rassay off the north west coast of Scotland.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Interestingly, this is the same year that Alexander MacDonald, my Great Grandfather, arrived in this country.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>“In the mythology, Highlanders left Scotland because they were cleared off the land by landlords who wanted to raise sheep.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But the reality of the story is more complicated.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>At the time, their landlord, Baron MacDonald of Slate was doing three things.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He was auctioning off leases on the Scottish tenants lands.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Rents were going up and he was starting to move tenants to new land. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>As well, MacDonald was trying to raise a regiment of Highland soldiers for the British army and was disappointed that the volunteer rate was low.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And so he was basically threatening the families on his estates that if they did not supply younger sons for his regiment, they would face the consequences.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The backdrop is the collapse of the clans in Scotland.”</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I am sure that much of what was faced by the Selkirk settlers applied to our ancestors<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>as well, many of who came to Canada about the same time.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The President of the Belfast Historical Society had this to say about the legacy of the Selkirk Settlers.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“They had determination, a willingness to work, strong family ties, wonderful loyalty to country, family and friends, and a heart for hospitality.” I am sure that the same could be said about our Scottish ancestors.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The interpretive centre notes that these settlers had some money, having sold their possessions in Scotland.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Although poor, I believe that, in the Scottish tradition, they also had some schooling.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Prior to this, most of the Scottish settlers went to the USA especially the Carolinas.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was Douglas’ view, that British North America would be a more appropriate place for them to settle.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The success of the Selkirk Settlers on PEI apparently was a turning point and many Scottish settlers were soon to follow.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Forest Fires</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>This item is triggered by news of the massive forest fires in British Columbia and Alberta. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I know that the Miramichi has had its share of forest fires with the Miramichi Fire of 1825 being the big one.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The first one I remember was the Loggieville Fire in the early 1930’s.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It burned on both sides of the road between Napan and Loggieville and took years to reforest.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>(I am writing this at my cottage and do not have access to my reference material but think that the fire may have been in 1935.)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There was a Presbyterial Meeting at St. Paul’s church that summer and they prayed for rain – <b>and it rained. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>There was a fire in the woods on the south east side of the Black River near Route 11.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I believe it was a Saturday afternoon.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Norm and I were in town and heard about it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We came home, did the chores and then went to help fight the fire.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I recall carrying and using a water bag and pump.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was a small fire on the river bank and was contained that night.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I also remember the lunch of hard tack and bully beef.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>We had a couple of small fires at our place.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>One came through the woods from At. Finno’s and burned a pile of wood in the backfield behind where Eric Glendenning now lives).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I do not actually remember the fire but remember the burned-over trees.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Another was a fire that got away when Dad was burning brush in the back field (again behind Eric’s place).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I recall the neighbours coming with wagons and barrels and hauling water from the Branch Bridge to douse the flames.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I think that fire was out by nightfall.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I know that I am repeating this story from an earlier Newsletter, but Dad had ordered a permit to burn brush and it had still not arrived.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He decided to burn anyway in the expectation that the permit would be in the mail.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It wasn’t.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The fire got away.</p>
<p>One of our neighbours, John Fowlie, was the fire warden and was taking Dad to task for burning with out a permit.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Along came the RCMP, in the person of Bedford Peters who was stationed in Newcastle.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He was also a cousin of Dad’s.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When he walked over to where Dad and John Fowlie were, he handed Dad a paper and said, “Elmer, here is your permit”.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Apparently he had stopped and picked it up at the office before coming to Black River.</p>
<p>After I left home, I think that it was in the fall of 1947, there was a bad forest fire in the area.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I think that it started in Bay du Vin but came close to the Little Branch area.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Seems to me that I came home one weekend to see great clouds of smoke to the east of us.</p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Update<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>Chronicle No. 40 included a list of teachers at the Little Branch School.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Recently I came across an old school record that shows that Annie Ellis taught at the Little Branch School during the 1924-25 school year.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>School Buses</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>Some readers may recall the first school bus serving the Miramichi Rural High School.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was owned and operated by Mack and George Godfrey.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Eddie Godfrey thinks that it was a 11/2 ton Dodge chassis.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I recall that it was dark blue in colour.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I seem to recall that the exterior was fabricated in Chatham and the interior by Edgar Fowlie… but I am not sure.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The second Godfrey bus was a large manufactured bus in beautiful blue and grey.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I still recall the first time I got on it.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Later Tom and Cliff Adams operated the bus system but I do not recall any details.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>If readers have information or photos?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I’d love to provide more detail including hotos. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
