	<p>   
	</p>
	<p align="justify">The
	Maritimes, especially Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island, have
	been inundated with snow in recent weeks.  I am reminded of similar
	winters in the Miramichi when I was a youngster.</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">Before
	the advent of snow ploughs, after a winter storm, the men of the
	community would hitch their horses to sleds and break the road. 
	Breaking the road meant putting a

	</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">first
	track through the deep snow.  One team would make a track through
	the snow for a ways then another team would take a turn.  If the
	roads were badly drifted, sometimes a track would be made through
	the woods at the edge of the road.  A couple of the worst spots for
	snow were “Ken’s Hill” and at the Middle Black River School. 
	Because roads were often below the level of the fields, the “gut”
	would drift full.  The other common problem was when several storms
	with high winds occurred close together and the road drifted full
	each time after it was ploughed.</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">As
	roads were rebuilt, ditches were deepened, road surfaces were raised
	so snow would blow off, wooden fences were removed or replaced to
	reduce the build up of snow and snow fences were erected in fields
	parallel to the road to catch the snow</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">Later
	years also brought better snow removal equipment.  The earliest I
	remember were the road graders and the crawler tractors.  The
	crawler tractors could turn sideways on the road and push the snow
	well off the road.  By the winter of 1952, there was at least one
	snow blower available at the Government garage in Chatham.  Today
	heavy trucks are on the road early and often so keep the roads
	clear.  Their speed also allows them to hurl the snow well back
	across the ditches.</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">The
	grader type plow was very efficient if the snow was not too heavy. 
	When the snow was really heavy, however, the plow could not make a
	very wide track and often the snow would fall back again behind the
	blade trapping the plow.  Sometimes the drifted snow would be very
	hard and the plow would have to back up a number of times and take a
	run at the heavy snow.</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<h6 align="justify" style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">February
	1952</h6>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">The
	month of February 1952 was especially snowy.  I was teaching at the
	Miramichi Rural at the time.  February normally has 20 teaching days
	but that year; school was closed for 10 of them.  (As an aside, King
	George VI died on February 6, 1952)</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">One
	morning, I think that it was a Tuesday, Harold MacDonald started for
	work about 6:00 or so.  It was snowing and drifting; he got stuck
	half way down “Ken’s Hill.”  He walked back to our place and
	Norman hitched the team and went over to haul him out.  Norman
	couldn’t get the team past the truck because the road was too
	narrow and he couldn’t pull him backwards.  
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">It
	snowed and drifted all day.  When the snow stopped next morning,
	Harold’s truck was completely covered except for the aerial and
	top of the cab.  Harold shoveled out his truck on Wednesday but
	couldn’t move it.  Nothing moved that day but on Thursday, we got
	word that the plow from down river was working its way toward
	Chatham.  Just before suppertime, the plow passed the Little Branch
	School and shortly thereafter it disappeared around Finno’s turn –
	but it could not break through down the hill.</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">I
	remember taking a round-mouthed shovel and joining other men from
	the community over at “Ken’s hill” along where Harold’s
	truck was buried.  We would loosen the hard, packed snow with our
	shovels then the plow would back up the hill and take a run at the
	bank.  It gained some ground but when it came to a dead stop, the
	plow would back up again.  In the meantime we would loosen more
	snow.</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">I
	went home about 9 pm.  As I recall, the plow finally broke through
	about midnight and, in fact, was met at Frank MacLean’s lane by
	another plough coming from Chatham.  
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">The
	photos on the previous page shows Harold’s truck buried in the
	snow.  The photo of Norman’s truck was taken about the same spot a
	few days later.  
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">On
	a number of occasions school buses could not make their way through
	the snow and students were storm-stayed for a night or two at our
	place and other homes in the neighbourhood.</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<h6 align="justify" style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">Snowing
	the Bridge</h6>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">While earlier paragraphs describe
	an abundance of snow, it seems to me that there were occasions when
	the Little Branch Bridge had to be snowed.  Presumably because the
	bridge was covered, “snowing” was necessary to put snow on the
	floor of the bridge when heavily laden sleds were being taken
	through.  Whether this was a regular or occasional requirement, I do
	not know.  Was someone paid to snow the bridge on a regular basis?</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">Space in this issue does not allow me to tell
	about shoveling out our lane, barn doors and the yard.  Perhaps it
	will find its way into a later issue.
