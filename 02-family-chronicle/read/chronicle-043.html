	<h1 align="left"><b>Wool
	and Yarn</b></h1>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>We always
	kept a few sheep, perhaps a dozen or so – nor am I sure of the
	breed although I know they were white.  The sheep had their own shed
	at the top of the hill where we coasted.  It was easy to climb onto
	the roof of the sheep shed and jump off into the snow bank, which
	curled around it.  
	</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>Each
	spring there were new lambs, usually twins but sometimes only one;
	they always seemed sickly and some had to be nursed with a bottle. 
	Sometimes they were brought into the house for a few days,  Some
	died.  But they were cute.  In early summer the sheep had to be
	sheared.  Sheep shears were hand operated, very sharp and were
	hinged at one end not hinged in the middle like a pair of scissors. 
	I never sheared     
	</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>sheep but
	I helped Norman on at least one occasion.  
	</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>One put a
	few boards on top of sawhorses.  Sheep were caught and their front
	and hind legs were tied together.  Then they were put on the table
	and sheared.  Norm was pretty good at it although occasionally
	nicked the skin and drew blood.  Sometimes the sheep had ticks and
	had to be dusted or sprayed.  They sure looked funny with all the
	wool removed.  Shearing sheep was a dirty, smelly job partly because
	the wool was so oily.</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>I remember
	Norm bringing home half a dozen sheep in the old Model A.  He had
	removed the back seat and turned up the seat on the passenger side.</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>Also in
	the spring of the year, we docked the tails of the lambs.  Docking
	meant cutting off their tails to leave only a stub.  This was done
	with one chop with a sharp axe.  We had small cloth squares, perhaps
	a 4-inch square, and a bit of grease was put on the cloth and over
	the end of the stump.  This was used to keep the wound clean. 
	</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>After the
	ground warmed but before the grass grew, it was necessary to wash
	the wool.  It was a major undertaking.  The bags of wool were opened
	and the real dirty parts were snipped off and discarded.</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>In
	preparation for washing, rainwater was saved in large tubs and
	buckets.  Rainwater was used because it was softer than water from
	the well thereby using less soap but more important, resulting in
	cleaner wool.  The water was heated on the wood stove then the wool
	was washed and rinsed several times; the actual washing was done in
	the front yard.  Once Mum determined that the wool was clean, it was
	spread out in little, thin swatches on the grass to dry.  The clumps
	were small and kept thin so that they would dry quickly.    The wool
	would be left over night, or perhaps over a couple of nights, to dry
	then gathered up and bagged.</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>Later, the
	wool would be bundled into the old Model A Ford and taken to Brown’s
	Woolen Mills in Nelson.  I was only there once but I remember the
	big machines and the noise.  In my time, I think that it was the
	only operating woolen mill on the Miramichi.</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>The wool
	would be weighed and Mum would tell the manager what she wanted in
	the way of yarn – so many skeins of grey, white and sometimes
	other colours.  Then she would bargain as to what she thought she
	should get in return for the wool.  I think that you could get your
	own wool back as yarn or you could simply take an equivalent amount
	that was already in skeins.  The woolen mills got paid by taking
	wool rather than being paid in cash.</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>Mum
	sometimes had more wool than she needed so she would sell it to
	neighbours and, I think, she had some customers by mail.</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>Mum then
	knitted the wool into socks, mitts and sometimes sweaters for the
	family.  She could knit a pair of mitts or socks in a day or two and
	usually knitted while visiting or talking with family in the
	evening.  She often knitted socks or mitts for relatives or friends
	as Christmas gifts.</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<h5>Agricultural
	Society</h5>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>With the
	recent passing of Harry Watling, I was reminded of the Agricultural
	Society #103.  I do not know the history of agricultural societies
	generally or of the one in Black River but hopefully someone will
	prepare their history some day.  I’ve often wondered what happened
	to all the old records.  I was told once that the books had been
	turned over to the Agricultural office in Chatham.  I think that
	there were other agricultural societies in Napan and beyond but none
	east of Black River.</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>An
	Agricultural Society was like a Co-op.  Farmers banded together and
	bought seed, lime and fertilizer in bulk and sold it to themselves. 
	Seems to me that they also handled some agricultural pesticides or
	herbicides.  Farmers were canvassed each winter; their needs
	aggregated and then orders were placed. Lime and fertilizer was
	ordered by the ton (by the boxcar) either loose or bagged.  It came
	to the station in Loggieville.  When it arrived, John, Walter, Ken
	and Norm would go to Loggieville and shovel the lime or fertilizer
	from the boxcar to the wagons for farmers who had bought it.</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>When I was
	young, my Dad kept the Agricultural shed; this meant that he kept
	the books.  The only auditor I recall was Johnnie McKnight.  And I
	remember him coming to the house and going over the books.  When he
	finished, he inscribed the following: “Audited and found correct,
	John C. McKnight”.  The shed was well-built with a pitch roof,
	probably 10 to 12 ft wide and 20 to 24 feet long but that is only a
	guess.  It sat by the west side of the lane across from our back
	door.  Dad was the Secretary Treasurer and operated the shed.  I
	remember seeing the bags of timothy, alsike clover, red clover,
	alfalfa, etc.  Farmers would order the amount of each they wanted
	and then mix their own.</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>Walter
	became Secretary Treasurer after Dad died and moved the shed to his
	place.  I remember the men jacking up the shed and putting extra
	long bunks on the bobsled to carry the weight of the shed.  Then one
	morning, after a light snowstorm, a team of horses was hitched to
	the bobsleds and the shed was taken to Walter’s.  When Walter left
	Black River, I believe that Harry Watling operated the “shed”.</p>
