<div class="reader-summary">Don draws on Arnold J. Somers&#x27; memoir of 1920s-1940s Miramichi lumbering. Includes period wage data ($1.50/day in 1939-40), production figures (3.5-5,000 board feet per crew daily), and social history (poll taxes, road taxes, &quot;statute labour,&quot; poor houses in Chatham). Reflects on haywire as the &quot;duct tape of my era&quot; for farm repairs. Reader Donald Edge contributes etymology of local island names (Fox Island = &quot;Île au Pendu,&quot; Bay du Vin = &quot;Baie des Ovines&quot;). Discusses chimney fires and creosote buildup—practical knowledge from Don&#x27;s adult housekeeping. Links Don&#x27;s personal experience to broader regional economic and social history of the Depression and post-war era.</div>

	I am indebted to Art Mills
	for the loan of a book by Arnold J. Somers (1994) about his
	experiences as a lumberman on the Miramichi.  (Somers’ experiences
	not Arthur’s’)  The book rings with memories of peavies, log
	jams, biscuits, buns, beans, spruce, hemlock, sawmills and
	gingerbread.

	Here are a few nuggets –
	direct quotes from the book:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><p style="widows: 2; orphans: 2; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
		“in the winter of 1939-40,
		the wages were a dollar and one-half a day”</p></li>
		<li><p style="widows: 2; orphans: 2; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
		“a 12 foot piece (of
		yellow birch) being cut off first, then a 16, then another 12. 
		Altogether, there was over a thousand (board) feet in the three
		pieces”</p></li>
		<li><p style="widows: 2; orphans: 2; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
		A  crew of three could cut
		“anywhere from three-and-one-half to five thousand (board)  feet”
		a day</p></li>
		<li><p style="widows: 2; orphans: 2; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
		In the 1920’s “we all
		looked forward to the freedom of  bare feet”</p></li>
		<li><p style="widows: 2; orphans: 2; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
		In the 1920’s “the
		average earnings of a labourer were not more than $300 per year”</p></li>
		<li><p style="widows: 2; orphans: 2; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
		“I guess the people of my
		community were poor all right, but theirs was not the kind of
		poverty that produces despair or crime or the kinds of ugliness
		associated with the word ‘poverty’ today.  While they were
		short on material goods, they never lost their moral or spiritual
		strength, that is why they didn’t feel poor”</p></li>
		<li><p style="widows: 2; orphans: 2; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
		“everyone of voting age
		had to pay a poll tax of one dollar.  If this wasn’t paid you
		lost your voting privilege”</p></li>
		<li><p style="widows: 2; orphans: 2; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
		“If you owned a car, you
		had to pay a license and you were charged a small tax on gasoline. 
		There was also a road tax in the vicinity of five dollars.  Anyone
		who preferred could go to work on the road until he earned enough
		to pay this tax.  This work was called  ‘statute labour”</p></li>
		<li><p style="widows: 2; orphans: 2; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
		“then there was a school
		tax levied by each school board”</p></li>
		<li><p style="widows: 2; orphans: 2; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
		“there  was a tax
		collected by the county, called ‘poor rates’ or county rates”</p></li>
		<li><p style="widows: 2; orphans: 2; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
		There was a “poor house or
		Alms House” in Chatham’. …this was a large three story white
		building…” 
		</p></li>
		<li><p style="widows: 2; orphans: 2; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
		I remember staying at a
		nice, clean, local hotel for 75 cents a day for my room and three
		meals”</p></li>
		<li><p style="widows: 2; orphans: 2; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
		Cars had running boards. 
		When about to pass a person on foot, one would slow down and invite
		them to “jump on the running board”. When he reached his
		destination he would jump off without the car ever stopping.</p></li>

	The book also mentions the

	The haywire I remember came

	“According to early maps
	reprinted by Ganong, Fox Island was originally <em>Ile
	au Pendu</em>
	(Hangman's Island), and Bay du Vin was originally <em>Baie
	des Ovines (Sheep's Bay).</em>
	Fox Island was once a part of Glenelg Parish, and the 1851 Census
	lists occupants of houses 77 &amp; 78 in the Fox Island
	Establishment.<br />
<br />
There
	is also an Egg Island, but that may be another name for Huckleberry
	Island.&nbsp; For some reason lost in the mist of time&nbsp;I think
	Huckleberry Island had two names.&nbsp; Within the past few decades
	Portage Island split in two--does one half now have another name?”<br />

	We
	had or chimney cleaned a few days ago and I was reminded of chimney
	fires in Black River.  Creosote builds when the warm smoke meets the
	cold chimney and is especially bad when burning green wood.  Dry
	wood, on the other hand, allowed for a hotter fire and reduced the
	build up of creosote.</p>
