	&quot;Master Donald Edge,&quot; thanked me for the “wristers”
	and went on to say how I was helping win the war.&nbsp; All of us
	(all twelve or so) were swelled with pride for days, but I don't
	remember my knitting skills improving, and of course the war ended
	in relatively short order after the Upper Black River knit goods
	arrived in Europe.</i></p>

	across and the opposite for the return&nbsp;row.&nbsp; That we did
	for 8 rows and then we changed the order.&nbsp; Voila, a basket
	weave pattern.&nbsp; Due to the lack of experience, although I
	really did try, it was rather misshapen because of loose tension on
	the yarn here and too tight tension on the yarn there.&nbsp; I have
	since mastered the tension part, thank goodness, so things turn out

	<h3>Christmas Tree</h3>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">Our
	Christmas tree is up and decorated – a bit earlier than usual this
	year but some folks were dropping by and we thought that having our
	tree decorated would add to the Christmas spirit.</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">Whenever
	possible, I cut my own tree and I was pleased to be able to do so
	this year again.  It is a six-foot spruce (I prefer balsam fir).  It
	is a nicely shaped tree, not my usual “Charlie Brown” tree. 
	Over the years, the only person who consistently thought I brought
	home a nice tree was my mother.</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">The
	first time I ever selected and cut a Christmas tree was, I think, a
	few days before Christmas in 1945.  
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">It
	was a sunny but a bit blustery that day as I set off to find a tree
	– the snow was up to my knees, or at least above the tops of my
	rubber boots.  With axe in hand, I went down the hill and then
	walked back along the brook.  There were many evergreens but none
	seemed suitable.</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">When
	I reached the little backfield, I decided to look at the new growth
	along the line.  Nothing suitable.  By then I was getting cold and
	my rubber boots were filling with snow.  I crossed onto Uncle Jim’s
	property.  Lots of trees there but none were Christmas tree size.</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">I
	decided then to look up and spotted a fine looking top on a large
	tree.  With the aid of my trusty “double bitter”, the tree was
	soon prostrate on the ground.  I cut off a ten-foot length and
	headed for home “dragging the tree behind me.”  I was a tired
	teenager with feet both wet and cold when I reached home from that
	venture.</p>
	<p align="justify">In
	all the years I cut trees, except this one, my tree, even after I
	measured and cut off the butt, was always a foot taller than our
	ceiling would allow.  That one was no exception.  After finally
	getting it right and making a stand for it; it stood proudly in the
	corner of the parlour awaiting the trimmings.</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">First
	the star for the top – oops! I hadn’t considered that in my
	calculations.  Some judicial pruning with the butcher knife and the
	star stood proudly on the top.</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">Then
	came ornaments, layers of silver or silver and red rope (garland)
	and then the carefully hung icicles – most having been carefully
	stored since the previous year.  Christmas tree trimmings were
	almost sacred or family heirlooms; the only new items would be a
	fresh package of icicles. Everything else, including icicles, was
	carefully removed, stored and used again in following years.  
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">Our
	Christmas trees were always heavily laden with garland and icicles
	much more so than trees of today.  A visit to the Cameron’s, Jim
	and Janie, was a real treat because they had real candles on their
	tree that Mrs. Cameron would light when we came visiting.</p>

	Christmas to all and to all a goodnight</i></p>
