<h5>
	News</h5>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>The
	readership of the <b>Chronicle</b>
	is growing and I am delighted, as a result, to re-establish contact
	with three “first cousins once removed” - Donald Edge, Shirley
	MacKay and Tina (Watling) Newton.  Great to hear from you and
	thanks, Donald, for the family tree information.  I did not have
	much about the MacNaughton side and you have allowed me to extend my
	knowledge.  
	</p>
	<p><br />

	<p>The
	above photo shows my brother, Walter (1913-1998) on the right and
	his first cousin, George Elbridge Watling (born 1913), on the left. 
	I am not sure when or where the photo was taken however, it may have
	been taken in Hampton, Virginia where my father and Uncle George,
	Elbridge’s father, worked together on the Langley Field project.</p>
	<h5>MacNaughton Connection</h5>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>For
	the benefit of other readers, this is what I have on my MacNaughton
	roots.  Information about Scotland came mostly from Donald Edge.</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>John
	MacNauchtan was born at Dunderave Castle, Scotland and died (before
	1750) at Glenlyon, Perthshire, Scotland.  His son, Malcolm was also
	born at Dunderave Castle and died at Glenlyon.</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>Malcolm’s
	son, John, was also born (July 24, 1774) at Dunderave Castle; he
	married Catherine Stewart and they had eight children.  John died in
	Scotland.  Several of John’s children and his widow came to Black
	River.  One son, Alexander (1789-1849) married Janet Jack; they had
	four daughters one of whom, Christina, (1822 - 1901) married my
	Great Grandfather, Jubal (1823-1900) who was the son of Jubal
	Watling and Susan Leach.</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>Jubal
	and Christina’ s son, Jubal (1846-1915) married Grace McAskill
	MacDonald (1848-1934).  Their children were Christina Catherine
	MacKenzie, Elspeth Jardine MacNaughton, Jubal George Watling, Janet
	MacDonald Godfrey, John MacDonald Watling, James Alexander William
	Watling, Jane Elizabeth Jardine Glendenning, and Donald Ernest
	Watling.</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<h5>Feeding the pigs</h5>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>We
	always kept a few pigs at our place and it seems to me that we spent
	all of our time feeding them.  They often got a mixture of oats,
	barley and bran (just like seniors and their bran flakes). And of
	course either water or milk depending on the age of the pigs and any
	surplus milk.  In addition, a favourite at our place was either
	cooked potatoes or turnips.  
	</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>There
	was an old shed just outside our back door – probably 10 to 15
	feet from the house.  It was not large – perhaps 8 by 12 feet and
	inside was a huge cooker.  I am not sure what the pot was made from
	but I think that it was probably 6 feet long and maybe three feet
	wide and 15 to 16 inches deep.  As a kid, it seemed very large to
	me.  It was set on a brick base so that a fire could be lighted
	under it.</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>Turnips
	were dumped into the tub, water was added, the turnips were cooked. 
	We likely cooked potatoes there as well abut I only remember the
	turnips.  Cooking took a lot wood, which was hauled, to the shed on
	a hand sled.  When finished, potatoes were put into a 10-quart pail,
	meal was added and the turnips were mashed by pushing a stick, a
	piece of stove wood from the woodpile, down into the pail.  When the
	turnips cooled, they were carried to the barn and emptied into the
	pig’s trough.  
	</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>Readers
	who eat turnip will know the strong aroma; imagine cooking large
	quantities several times a week in a building only used for that
	purpose.  By the way, the old cook shed was torn down in the early
	1940’s when John built a garage for our 1939 Ford truck.</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>Sometimes
	potatoes were cooked on the kitchen stove for the same purpose.  A
	huge pot of potatoes would be boiled and the process would be
	repeated as with turnips.</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>At
	our house the kitchen stove was more or less at one end of the
	kitchen and the back door was reached through a little room at the
	other end.  I remember once, a pot of hot potatoes hot off the stove
	was sitting on the floor near the back door.  It was winter; the
	floor was wet from snow being carried in on many feet.  I was
	heading for the back door  - presumably running, slipped and rammed
	my arm into the hot pot of potatoes.  For years the burn mark could
	be seen on my forearm.</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<h5>A Bull Story</h5>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>Those
	who know me will acknowledge that my stories often contain some
	bull.  While at the recent family reunion, I was recalling my
	memories of being on a picnic and chased by a bull.  I thought that
	Grace was there but wasn’t sure.  Ken vouches that the story is
	true and filled in some of the details.<b>
	 </b>
	</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>In
	1924, Dad bought the property across from the Presbyterian Church
	from Dan MacLean.  Later, Walter buildt a home on the property.     
	</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>Some
	time in the early 1930’s, Walter and likely John ,along with Bert
	Macdonald who worked regularly at home, were cutting alders/bushes
	along Walter’s brook one fine summer’s day.  In the late
	morning, Ken, Marjorie Watling and I, and perhaps Grace and ??? took
	a horse and wagon, it was only two miles, to take the men their
	lunch, and to have a picnic.  While picnicking, a bull grazing
	nearby began to move closer and closer although he did not actually
	charge us.  The bull was somewhat reluctant to leave but Bert drove
	him away while we scrambled through a wire fence into the next
	field.  It was exciting.  It seems to me that there was a photo of
	us having our picnic but I am not sure.</p>
