</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Celebrates the 50-year reunion of the MRHS graduating class of 1957 with a photo and attendee names (Lola Jenkins Miller, Elizabeth Williston Belyea, William Godfrey, etc.). Implies Don&#x27;s continued connection to the school and students decades after his tenure. Includes anecdotes about logging terminology from an Miramichi lumbering book (widow-maker, two-sled, etc.). Features a personal reflection on red ochre paint stored in a barn workshop—a cheap farm paint mixed with linseed oil used for rural buildings. Describes the wagons shed at Don&#x27;s family farm, the Model A stored during the Depression, and tools for farm equipment repair. Provides material culture context for rural life during Don&#x27;s childhood/young adulthood.</div>

	Congratulations
	to the graduating class of 1957 from the Miramichi Rural High School
	on their recent reunion.  The reunion was held in the Father T. A.
	McDonald Memorial Hall, Miramichi.  Those in attendance enjoyed a
	dinner catered by the Ladies of St. Stephen’s United Church and
	story telling (and retelling ! !) and exchanging information and
	experiences through the intervening years.</p>

		I just read another book
		about lumbering in the Miramichi in the early 1940’s.  Some of
		the terms I had not heard before or  for a long while included a
		“widow-maker” – a loose branch or treetop suspended high
		above the ground that could fall and strike someone unawares; a
		“two sled” - from the description I would say it was a set of
		bob sleds; “dealed up boards” - I figure are two by fours (at
		least we called a two-by-four a “deal”; the “devils mount”
		- a device used to lift the front end of a log while it was being
		twitched to the road.</p></li>

	There was a shed on the west
	end of our barn; I do not know if it was original or Dad added it
	after he purchased the place.  We called it the wagon shed and
	wagons were store at ground level; the old Model A was put on blocks
	and stored there during the depression.  Upstairs was a workshop
	shop including a bench with tools used around the farm.  In the shop
	also was stored some lumber; I remember especially the 2, 3 and 4
	inch maple, birch and beech cut at the back of the farm and used for
	repairing sleds, wagons and other machinery.</p>

	<p style="orphans: 2; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%; widows: 2">
	In the shop also was a barrel
	of dull red oily liquid – a barrel of red ochre.  Red ochre was a
	paint colour, probably purchased in a block or as a powder and mixed
	with linseed oil.  In Newfoundland, they mixed the red ochre with
	seal oil or cod liver oil.  It probably was in a metal barrel; my
	recollection is that it was without a top but it did have a burlap
	cover over it.</p>

	Red ochre in oil was a cheap
	form of red paint, sort of a dull red, used for farm buildings.  One
	still sees old red barns or sheds throughout the countryside; later
	buildings have red doors and trim but I think that most of these are
	paint.  In all the years it sat there, I cannot ever recall the red
	ochre being used but I know it was there.</p>

	have a copy of a map of Black River “Drawn and published from

		There are three Watlings
		shown, a W. Watling on the north side of the River west of the
		Richibucto road and two J. Watlings on the south side.  One would
		be Jubal (1821-1900) married to Christina MacNaughton; the other
		likely was   Jubal’s son, Jubal (1846-1915) married to Grace
		MacDonald.  The W. Watling is likely William Watling, the first
		Jubal’s brother married to Mary MacNaughton, a sister of
		Christina. I do not know which</p></li>

		The Little Branch Road on

		McNaughton, and G. Fowley.  Alexander MacDonald, the original
		grantee on the land where Norman and Neil now live, was born in
		1775 so was no longer living when this map was drawn.  The J
		MacDonald could have been his son, John, or his daughter, Jessie. 
		By 1901, the east half of the Alexander Mac Donald property was
		owned by John Macdonald and the western half by Jessie MacDonald. 
		The Sinclair property, next to the Alexander MacDonald property in
		my day belonged to a MacNaughton.</p></li>
