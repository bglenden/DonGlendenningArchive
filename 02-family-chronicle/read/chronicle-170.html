	In a  recent issue of the
	Chronicle, I noted the price of binder twin as 90 cents a ball in
	1942 with a ball being a bit larger than a 1kg coffee can but, of
	course, much heavier.</p>

	Early settlers cut grain with
	scythe and sickle; a major breakthrough occurred in 1831 with the
	invention of the McCormick reaper in Virginia.  The advent of the
	binder forty years later resulted in grain being cut and bundled
	then dropped on the ground.  The twine used in the binder became
	known as binder twine.  Early binder twine was made of sisal, a
	natural product, which was biodegradable.  The combine replaced the
	binder and threshes the grain as it harvests; binder twine is not
	needed.</p>

	The advent of the hay baler,
	however, provided a new need for twine, baler twine, much of which
	is synthetic.  Baler twine is, I believe, much heavier than binder
	twine.

	‘<i><b>Haywire</b></i><i><b>
	is a compound of the words </b></i><i><b>hay</b></i><i><b>
	and </b></i><i><b>wire,</b></i><i><b>
	originally simply denoting wire used to bale hay or straw. The term
	is first recorded as a noun in a debate in the Canadian House of
	Commons (1917), so it is a Canadianism or, since it appeared soon
	thereafter in a U.S. publication, a North Americanism. We find an
	earlier (1905) attributive use in the phrase </b></i><i><b>hay
	wire outfit,</b></i><i><b>
	a term used contemptuously for poorly equipped loggers. What lies
	behind this term is the practice of making repairs with haywire.
	</b></i><i><b>Haywire</b></i><i><b>
	is found in other contexts with the general sense &quot;makeshift,
	inefficient,&quot; from which come the extended senses &quot;not
	functioning properly&quot; and &quot;crazy</b></i></p>

	<p style="orphans: 2; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%; widows: 2">
	Although Tabusintac is on the
	north shore of the Miramichi, because the river runs roughly east
	and west, the Tabusintac Hill is on Route 11 between Chatham and
	Bathurst. Given my Dad’s roots were in the Bathurst area, we
	frequently traveled that road and the hill was well known to our
	family.  Two other hills along the road were the Big Eskedellick and
	the Little Eskedellick; according to my NB book of place names, the
	proper spelling is Eskedelloc.  While checking information recently,
	I’ve come to the conclusion that the Little Eskedelloc was really
	the south Tabusintac Hill.  But the important thing is not the name.</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; widows: 2; orphans: 2; line-height: 100%">
	<br />

	</p>
	<p style="orphans: 2; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%; widows: 2">
	The Tabusintac Hill was
	certainly the biggest hill in the area - as I recall, it had seven
	turns.  Driving it today one is not aware of the depth of the
	valley.  In addition, early cars were quite different from those of
	today.  Stories abound, at least in our household, and I believe
	there to be some truth in all of them:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><p style="widows: 2; orphans: 2; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
		Sometimes drivers turned
		their cars and backed up the hill.  Two reasons were given; (1)
		Gasoline was gravity fed from a tank just ahead of the windshield
		and the design of some tanks meant that the flow of gasoline was
		better when backing up the hill. (2) The ratio of reverse gears in
		some old cars meant that the car had more power backing up than it
		did moving forward.</p></li>
		<li><p style="widows: 2; orphans: 2; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
		Radiators on early cars
		often overheated and the water evaporated. Brother Ken tells the
		story of having to walk to the bottom of the hill to fill a can of
		water for the radiator of the old Model A.  The heat from the
		engine labouring up the hill caused some of the water in the
		radiator to evaporate.</p></li>
		<li><p style="widows: 2; orphans: 2; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
		My father always made a trip
		to his old home, Canobie, late every fall and each time he returned
		with a supply of “green “codfish for the winter.  (Green was
		not the colour but meant that the cod had simply been cleaned and
		salted)  On one trip, he went on a buying spree and brought home
		two horses in a trailer behind the Model A, a half ton of green cod
		on the rear luggage rack and two geese in a makeshift cage in the
		back seat.  While in Canobie, there was a snowfall and the roads
		became icy; on his return, half way up the south side of the
		Tabusintac hill, the tires began to spin on the snow and ice. 
		While Walter, who was driving, held his foot on the brakes, Dad
		wrapped a logging chain around each wheel.  They managed to get
		home safely but it was a harrowing experience, to say the least.</p></li>
