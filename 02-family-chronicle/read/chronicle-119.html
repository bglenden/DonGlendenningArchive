	I believe that I started at
	MRHS in 1941 and graduated in 1946.  There were about 30 of us in
	Grade 7 but only 12 graduated (Grade 11 was the last year of high
	school).</p>

		Ken, Norm and I were at the
		MRHS at the same time, which meant 3 “shortening pails” for
		lunches.  One teacher had both Norm and I in her classes.  She
		called Norm “Big Glendenning” and called me “Little
		Glendenning”.

		One
		trick was to place a paper cup full of water on the top edge of a
		almost closed classroom door.  When the door was opened, the cup of
		water came tumbling down, hopefully on someone’s head.  Needless
		to say, it left a mess on the floor – especially after doing it
		several times.</p></li>

		The
		school had hot and cold running water and flush toilets –
		probably the first in the area.  The boy’s toilet was constructed
		in such a way that there was a beam across the top of the entry to
		the section where the stalls were.  It was a great place to
		practice “chinning”.   I think that I could do a dozen but know
		that most others could do many more.</p></li>

		Perley Quayle was a fine man
		and a good teacher but also a person who understood student pranks.
		 He had a Model A Coupe which he usually parked at the east end of
		the school.  We frequently lifted it and turned it around.  Mr.
		Quayle could quote Latin but also repair an automobile.</p></li>

		One morning I missed the bus
		at the Little Branch corner and had to walk to school – about 3
		miles.  Of course, I was late.  When I stepped into the school, I
		met Mr. Quayle.  I explained what had happened and then quipped
		“Better late than never” to which he responded ‘Yes, but
		better never late.”</p></li>

		Lowell Williston had lost a
		leg in an accident with a hay mower and had a wooden replacement. 
		In the fall of 1939, there was an outbreak of scarlet fever.  The
		school health officer was a Dr. Loggie.  One sign of scarlet fever
		was a rash on one’s back, arms or legs.  Dr. Loggie, the Health
		Inspector, would check these areas as an indicator of scarlet
		fever.  He asked Lowell to pull up his pant leg; Dr. Loggie looked
		at his leg and pronounced him free of scarlet fever; it was
		Lowell’s wooden leg.</p></li>

		In the early years, we had
		to plant and tend a school garden.  As I recall, we were paired and
		each pair had a small plot.  Come fall, the vegetables were
		harvested and canned.  The latter was part of the course in Home
		Economics. The canned vegetables were kept in the closet under the
		stairs.  Occasionally, some of the boys would sneak into the closet
		before noon, open one of the cans, place the can inside the sheet
		metal on top of the furnace to warm and then enjoy canned
		vegetables as part of their lunch.</p></li>

		Perley Quayle brought some
		of his own equipment to the school for our use in the shop.  One
		item was a huge lathe for wood turning.  It was operated like a
		treadle sewing machine; one student usually provided power while
		another was turning a project on the lathe.  Mr. Quayle also set up
		a blacksmithing area in the coal bin behind the furnace and we
		learned to work metal in the forge – shaping, welding, annealing,
		tempering, etc.

		One sunny warm spring day, a
		number of boys wandered down to the shore from the school yard and
		went for a swim.  We were knowingly late for the first class after
		lunch.  I do not remember any discipline resulting from the
		escapade.</p></li>

		The school had a very tall
		flagpole.  The system of erecting the flagpole was an interesting
		example of pulleys and levers with horses used as the power. 
		Although I remember how, it is difficult to explain without the use
		of diagrams.</p></li>
