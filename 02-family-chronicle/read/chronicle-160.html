<div class="reader-summary">A detailed analysis of the 1851 Northumberland County Census for Glenelg Parish and Black River, compiled by Donald Edge. The census recorded 281 households with settlers predominantly Scottish and Irish, arriving in the 1820s-1830s. The article catalogs occupations (farmers, fishermen, weavers, teachers), identifies unusual settler names, and documents health challenges and absences. Don&#x27;s ancestors Alexander and Jane MacNaughton appear as farmers with daughter teachers, while Jubal Watling and Christina appear in household records. The issue concludes with Don&#x27;s reflection on beech nuts and autumn walks along the family farm&#x27;s wooded ridge.</div>

<p><b><i>Glenelg Parish and Black River in the 1851 Census</i></b></p>
<p><b><i>By Donald Edge, November 2001</i></b></p>
<p><b><i></i></b><br></p>
<p><b><i>The 1851 Northumberland County Census is the earliest record of<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>households in Glenelg Parish.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The Census contains the names of family members, their sex, relationship, age,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>national origin, occupation, religion (if known) and their date of arrival in what was then a colony.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Researchers have noted that the Glenelg Census was often inaccurate.* Compilers of the<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>printed version assigned house numbers, and these are included in the following to simplify research reference .</i></b></p>
<p><b><i></i></b><br></p>
<p><b><i>There were 281 households in Glenelg, compared with 501 in Chatham.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>majority of Glenelg settlers were Scots and Irish, followed by French, English, Welsh, and a smattering<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>from Shetland, Portugal, USA, and the Isle of Man. Houses #77 and #78 were located in the Fox Island Establishment.**<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></i></b></p>
<p><b><i></i></b><br></p>
<p><b><i>Most of the settlers arrived in the 1820s and 1830s. The earliest settler identified in the Glenelg Census is widow Sarah McIntyre (house #59), who arrived from America in 1774.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Widow Isabella McInnes (#88) arrived from Scotland in 1778. The oldest resident was <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>88 year old widow Elizabeth McKnight in house # 158, <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>the youngest was one month old Barbara MacDonald<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>in house #69.</i></b></p>
<p><b><i></i></b><br></p>
<p><b><i>While there were many labourers, and remarkably quite a few servants, the great majority were farmers, although some had a <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>sideline.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There was one farmer who was also a cooper (barrel-maker), one lighthouse keeper (Escuminac), one mason, two carpenters, two millers, two proprietors, three joiners, five shoemakers, seven teachers,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>eight lumberers,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>nine fishermen, ten river pilots, and ten weavers.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>John McDonald (house #123) was a fisherman and Magistrate.</i></b></p>
<p><b><i></i></b><br></p>
<p><b><i>Chatham had many farmers, but most were folks whose occupations you would find in any town. Given its location, there were a large number of shipwrights; the town also had many<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>cordwainers, makers of leather shoes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Some parishes, not Glenelg, had "Paupers," and there was one "Mantua maker" (dressmaker), and in Nelson George Riplee (#60) was a "Thompsonian Farmer?"-- while the modern editor of the Census seems puzzled, Riplee was what today would be called an organic farmer.</i></b></p>
<p><b><i></i></b><br></p>
<p><b><i>Some of the Glenelg names were unusual:<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Farquhar McRae, Bona McKinnon, Asa Parley, Phineas Gallagher, Sylvanus Dutcher, Gluttid Muzerall.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Isabella was a quite common name, and evidence of Census inaccuracy is apparent in Elspet McDonald and Elspit Ullock.</i></b></p>
<p><b><i></i></b><br></p>
<p><b><i>Not everyone in Glenelg was well.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Here they are by house and problem:<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>#7<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>and #138 had folks who were infirm, #11 infirm/debility, #46 lame, two in house #66 were "Silly," #75 lunatic, #105<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>imbecile/bedridden (21 years), #164 idiot, and #269 deaf and dumb.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If some were not at all well or not all there, some were not even there at all: two in households #92 and #104 were "absent (prison)."<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The saddest absent case was Chatham Parish's Johanna Gilbert (#116), "St. John Asylum."</i></b></p>
<p><b><i></i></b><br></p>
<p><b><i>In the 1851 Census our MacNaughton ancestors are unremarkable. Two daughters of Donald MacNaughton and Margaret MacBeath were teachers.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Malcolm MacNaughton and Barbara MacBeath's daughter Elizabeth lived with her parents along with her husband, Alexander Dick, "labourer." Alexander MacNaughton's widow, Janet Jack, had in her home the family of her daughter Christina and Christina's husband, Jubal Watling.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></i></b></p>

<p><b><i></i></b><br></p>
<p><b><i>*The census takers had idiosyncracies.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The one in Blackville noted those who had been born in Nova Scotia or Prince Edward Island.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The one in Nelson singled out several men as "Robust," including the Catholic priest. In Northesk, William Davidson (#12) was "Farmer/Battle of Waterloo," and William Johnston (#97) had "Both legs off at knees."<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The cause is not given, but it is for Andrew McGrigor, lodger in Newcastle house #257, "Lost both legs by frost."</i></b></p>
<p><b><i></i></b><br></p>
<p><b><i>** Fox Island is a long barrier island off French River Point on the Miramichi.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It has long been the site of commercial fishing operations. At the time of the Census it was in Glenelg Parish. The island was named by J.F.W. DesBarres in 1781, probably for the British statesman Charles James Fox (1749-1806). Its old French name was Ile du Pendu, Hanging Island.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The hanged may have been people or fish or both. The origin of that old name appears to be lost.</i></b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Beech Nuts </b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I am a fudge maker and a fudge eater; I used to make it often but found myself over eating so now I usually buy fudge instead.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My recipe is a simple one and nearly always works.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The exception is when I make fudge at my son’s place in New Mexico; I blame it on my inability to take into account the higher elevation.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Last week we were out to a play with friends and I bought fudge; I do that to control my eating not because the fudge is better.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>In the conversation that followed, I was reminded of the walks on sunny autumn days to the hardwood ridge near the rear of the farm. The ridge was heavily wooded with maple, beech, white and yellow birch and the occasional ash (good for axe handles).</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Beech tree leaves turn yellow in the fall and beech nuts, small, triangular and about the size of your little finger nail are very tasty.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When ripe, they are quite easy to open.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>One scratches aside the leaves to find the nuts,, pries them open and enjoys their taste.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>But beech nuts are also good in fudge so, if the finding was easy, we would stuff beech nuts into our pockets and carry them back to the house where Mother would stir them into her brown sugar fudge. M m m Good.</p>
