	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify" style="orphans: 2; widows: 2">“<i>I
	too like the dumpcart, but my favorite was the hayrake</i></p>
	<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
	<p align="justify"><i>In
	all the heat and sweat and flies and boredom of haying, there was
	one light moment.  When the fields were cleared of hay, </i>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify"><i>I
	got to ride the hay rake to glean any remaining hay.  It was light
	work and it took place in the cool of the early evening, and the
	gray horse, free from the heavy harness and the hay wagon, went at a
	quick pace as we went up and down and around the fields, very
	occasionally stopping while I pulled the long handle to raise the
	rake and release the hay. It was one of the highlights of my boyhood
	in Black River.”</i></p>
	<h2>Mrs.
	Christina MacKenzie (1876-1956)</h2>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">I
	have an undated press clipping which reads as follows:</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">“<i>The
	death of Mrs. Christina MacKenzie, wife of the late John MacKenzie,
	a well-known resident of Loggieville, occurred at Mount St. Joseph's
	Pavilion here at an early hour Friday morning.</i></p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify"><i>The
	late Mrs. MacKenzie was the former Christina Watling of Black River
	and was eighty years of age.  She was twice married, her first
	husband being Thomas Adams of Black River.</i></p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify"><i>Surviving
	from her first marriage are two sons, James Adams and Willard Adams
	both of Chippewa, Ontario. Surviving from her second marriage are
	two daughters, Mrs. F. Schickle, Mandarin, Florida and Miss Jean
	MacKenzie, Chippewa, Ontario.  Two sisters and three brothers also
	survive.  They are Mrs. John R. Godfrey, Black River Bridge, and
	Mrs. Elmer Glendenning, Black River;  James  A Watling, Black River,
	George A. Watling, New Hampshire, and D. Ernest Watling,
	Loggieville.  </i>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify"><i>The
	funeral was held on Sunday afternoon from the home of Ernest
	Watling, Loggieville.  A short service at the house was followed by
	a public service 	at Knox United Church.  Interment was made in the
	Pine Grove Cemetery.”</i></p>

	<h2>The Preacher
	and the Bear</h2>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">Our early
	morning CBC radio show of January 9, 2005, in response to a request,
	played a song about the preacher and the bear.  In 1937 Ken stayed
	the winter in with Venetia in Point 
	</p>
	<p align="justify">Aux Carr
	while Cam was fishing smelts.  Cam and Netia had an old gramophone,
	which took cylindrical records; one record told the story of the
	Preacher and The Bear.  We must have driven Venetia crazy playing
	and replaying it.  I haven’t heard it since but was reminded of it
	this morning.  Here are a few lines from the song as best I
	remember:</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">“<i>A
	preacher went out a’ hunting</i></p>
	<p align="justify">“<i>Twas
	on a Sunday morn.</i></p>
	<p align="justify"><i>Of
	course, ‘twas against his religion</i></p>
	<p align="justify"><i>But
	he took his gun along</i></p>
	<p align="justify"><i>He
	shot himself a very fine …</i></p>
	<p align="justify"><i>And
	one big ……hare</i></p>
	<p align="justify"><i>But
	on his way returning home</i></p>
	<p align="justify"><i>Met
	a great big grizzly bear.</i></p>
	<p align="justify"> 
	</p>
	<h4>The bear walked out to the middle of the road</h4>
	<p align="justify"><i>He
	walked to the coon you see</i></p>
	<p align="justify"><i>The
	coon got so excited</i></p>
	<p align="justify"><i>It
	climbed a persimmon tree</i></p>
	<p align="justify"><i>The
	bear sat down in the middle of the road</i></p>
	<p align="justify"><i>And
	the coon climbed out on a limb.</i></p>
	<p align="justify"><i>And
	he cast his eyes to the Lord in the skies</i></p>
	<p align="justify"><i>And
	these words said to him</i></p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify"><i>O
	Lord who delivered Jonah</i></p>
	<p align="justify"><i>From
	 the belly of the whale, and then</i></p>
	<p align="justify"><i>The
	Hebrew children from the fiery furnace</i></p>
	<p align="justify"><i>So
	the good book doth declare.</i></p>
	<p align="justify"><i>Oh
	Lord, if you can’t help me</i></p>
	<h4>For goodness sake can’t you help that bear?”</h4>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">I know there
	were additional verses but I cannot recall the words.</p>
