	Farmers sometimes bought
	horses shipped from the west.  Horses were rounded up, loaded into
	boxcars and shipped east to be used on farms.    The ones in the
	middle of the car were called shunts and often died on route from
	the battering received when rail cars were being shunted on to
	sidings.

	Robert Henry Peters was blind
	and had a “shunt” horse called “Pete”.  With his daughter,
	Eva’s help, he would plough the first furrow.  Thereafter, he
	continued to plough by keeping one foot in the furrow.

	Once a heavy winter storm
	came up and Eva, Jennie’s mother, started home alone from school
	walking backwards into the heavy wind and snow.  In the meantime,
	her father hitched Pete to come looking for her.  Her father did not
	see the child on the road but the horse stopped and would go no
	further even though Robert used the whip.  The horse refused to move
	forward and simply stamped its feet.  Just then, Eva, backed into
	the horse’s chest.  The horse knew she was there and refused to
	step on her.</p>

	“Uncle Frank settled in
	Portland, Maine.  … One year he decided to pay us (his brother,
	Chipman Glendenning in Canobie) a surprise visit at Christmas and
	experience once more his memories of winter on the farm, but – the
	surprise was as much his as ours. Uncle Frank said,  “This is not
	like winter on the farm!  Why, after doing the necessary chores, we
	all huddled close to the old Star cook stove in the kitchen, moving
	only far enough away to eat and do necessary indoor jobs.  Bricks or
	stones were heated in the oven until bedtime for each person,
	wrapped in and old garment and put into bed, mostly two together,
	which helped to keep each other warm. Now your whole house is as
	comfortably heated as ours is the States is!  The hardwood in the
	furnace really holds the heat at night – no getting up in the
	freezing cold. - water frozen in the kitchen and so on.  Lil and
	Bertha won’t believe me when I tell them how cozy you are here. 
	I’ve been talking for years about what it was like growing up on
	the farm.  Now, they’ll think that I was stringing them along all
	this time.”</p>
