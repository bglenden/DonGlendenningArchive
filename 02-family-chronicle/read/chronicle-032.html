<p><b>Christmas Present</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>As I write this I am preparing to travel to Ottawa to spend Christmas with our daughter, Janet.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>After traveling the world, Janet settled in Ottawa and works for the Federal Government.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A couple of months ago, she purchased her first home.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We also have a niece, Doreen, in Ottawa as well as some friends so we look forward to our visit.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>We spent last Christmas in Socorro, New Mexico with our son, Brian, and his wife, Marie, and daughters Lisa and Laura.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This year, Brian and his family will travel to California where Marie’s father and mother, Mario and Estelle Carota, will be celebrating their 60<sup>th</sup> wedding anniversary. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Congratulations.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Both Brian and Marie work at the National Radio astronomy Observatory.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Lisa is in her second year at the University of New Mexico at Albuquerque and Laura is in her last year of high school. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The year has been a good one.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We spent April in Victoria, British Columbia where we drank in spectacular scenery, entertained two of Carol’s friends from nursing school, visited Islanders now living there and saw again colleagues I worked with over the years.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>After a summer at the cottage, we enjoyed a two-week bus tour of Central Europe and then spent two weeks in Ottawa helping Janet move to her new abode.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Following this, I made my usual fall visit to the Miramichi.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And now, we are about to go on the road again.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Carol keeps busy with her painting classes and painting (watercolour) , her bridge and reading.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I keep busy with genealogy, writing and some volunteer work with the Community Foundation of Prince Edward Island.</p>
<p><br></p>

<p><b>Christmases Past</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>Christmas is a time to recall happy occasions (although not all Christmases qualify).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Following are some random recollections and thoughts.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Santa brought a red “caterpillar” style tractor.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I recall taking it up to my room, the one at the front of the house above the parlour, winding it up and watching it crawl over the bedclothes.</p>
<p>Lillian came home for Christmas and the people she worked for sent me a train, a Lionel”, including tracks.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was not electric; one wound it with a key.</p>
<p>When I was older, I did not think there was a Santa Claus, but I did not want to take any chances.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When I got about half way up the stairs on my way to bed on Christmas Eve, I called my sister, Elinor, over to the side of the stairs and asked her to hang up a stocking for me.</p>
<p>I think that I was about sixteen when I went for the first time by myself to cut a Christmas tree.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I recall crossing the brook and wading through the snow to the back field.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Finally, I found a tree, probably on Uncle Jim’s property, chopped it down and dragged it through the snow to the house.</p>
<p>Mrs. Jim (James R.) Cameron always had a beautifully decorated tree that was loaded with ornaments.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As I recall, she had real candles on the tree and would sometimes light them when she had company.</p>
<p>Mum always made fudge on Christmas Eve and often wrapped some as a gift for Uncle Jim.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I remember taking it across the road on Christmas Eve.</p>
<p>Long after Lillian was married, Mum would make a Christmas fruit cake for her.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She made it in a tin can, about the size of a one-pound coffee can, and would mail it to Lillian in time for Christmas.</p>
<p>One Christmas, 1939 I think, I received seven books as gifts.</p>
<p>We didn’t open our gifts, except the ones from Santa Claus, until after the morning chores were done.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Then we would all sit around while the gifts were passed out.</p>
<p>Our Christmas stockings were clean woolen stockings of the kind we wore every day.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They usually included an orange and/or an apple, a few pennies or a nickel, peanuts, walnuts, maybe pecans, and hazelnuts, and candy.</p>
<p>Family members usually dropped by in the evening for a visit.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I remember going to the pantry to find extra candy for our guests.</p>
<p>Mum also knitted many pairs of socks and mitts as Christmas gifts.</p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Thanks</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>Over the year, I heard from a number of friends I hadn’t seen or heard from for many years.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Thanks for your notes and information.</p>
<p><b></b><br></p>

<p><b>With Best Wishes For 2003</b></p>
