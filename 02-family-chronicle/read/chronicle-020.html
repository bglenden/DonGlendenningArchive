<p>I am thankful to Jeannie Glendenning for the following two items.</p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Mrs. Jubal Watling</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>The Tri- Weekly (Chatham, NB)<b> </b>included the following item for September 28, 1934.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span>A</span>Many friends in Little Branch and vicinity heard with regret of the death of Mrs. Jubal Watling, which occurred at her home yesterday afternoon.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The late Mrs Watling was aged 86 years and before her marriage was Miss Grace MacDonald of Black River.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The funeral will be held on Saturday afternoon Service will commence at 2:30 o<span>=</span>clock and will be conducted by Rev. A. R. Gibson of Chatham.</p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>Surviving are four daughters and four sons, Mrs. J. R MacKenzie, Loggieville; Mrs. J. W. MacNaughton, Mrs. J. R. Godfrey, Mrs. Elmer Glendenning, Black River; George and John, New Hampshire, James A. with whom she resided; Ernest Watling, Loggieville.<span>@</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Jubal Watling</b><b></b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The Chatham Gazette of February 22, 1915 reported the following:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span>A</span>The funeral of the late Jubal Watling was held on Thursday afternoon from his late residence, service started at 2:00 o<span>=</span>clock and being conducted by Rev. George Grant of Black River.</p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The choir of St. Stephen<span>=</span>s Church, Black River, was present and rendered appropriate hymns.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Interment was in St. Stephens burying ground and the pallbearers were Messr. Alex Watling, William Watling, Donald Watling and Malcolm Watling, brothers of the deceased and John MacRae and Matthew Dickson, brothers-in-law.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The attendance at the service was very Large, those paying last tribute of respect to the deceased coming from miles around and testifying to their feeling of regret at the demise of a fine and widely respected citizen.<span>@</span><b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Woodcutter</b><b></b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>As I write this item, we are having beautiful but cool weather and the ground is still covered with snow.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I am reminded of similar mornings, 60 years ago, of being wakened about 6:30 to go across to Harper<span>=</span>s or Adams<span>=</span> to get an extra man or two for the woodcutter.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Perhaps someone was not able to come at the last minute or an extra person was needed.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>So I would hie across the crust and in the lane about 6:30 to 7:00 am looking for someone.<b><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span></b>Other than the beautiful morning and hiking across the crust, the thing I remember most was my fear of Harper<span>=</span>s dog.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I am sure, in hindsight, that the dog was had no intention of biting me but at the time I couldn<span>=</span>t tell what he was thinking.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Collecting Sap</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b></b>We always tapped a few maple trees on the ridge when the nights were cool and the days were warm.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The sap was good to drink but had little if any taste.</p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>I recall occasions of going to the Ridge with Ken early in the morning to empty the sap buckets.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Ken hitched the horse and we took milk cans, of the kind used to ship cream to the creamery and I recall once taking the barrel from the churn to bring the sap to the house.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>On occasion, and maybe frequently, Mum would boil the sap to make maple syrup.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It takes a barrel, 45 gallons, of sap to make a gallon of syrup<b> </b>and it seemed to take forever to reduce sap to syrup.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It took even more boiling to reduce sap to maple sugar. Maybe it seemed like a long time because<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>because it was usually my job to keep the woodbox filled.</p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Glendenning Family Fund</b><b></b></p>
