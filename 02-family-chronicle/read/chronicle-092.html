	<h3><b>Great Miramichi Fire of 1825</b></h3>
	<p align="justify" style="widows: 0; orphans: 0"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify" style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">Donald
	Edge and I have been in touch about the Miramichi Fire of 1825.  The
	fire was preceded by very hot and dry weather.  The fire appears to
	have started north west of Newcastle and on October 7 swept
	eastward, especially on the north side of the river, practically
	destroying all of Newcastle and Gretna Green (Douglastown) .  An
	estimated 160 to 200 people lost their lives. 
	</p>
	<p align="justify" style="orphans: 0; widows: 0"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify" style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">The
	<u>History of Chatham</u>
	by William Godfrey mentions the devastation on the north side of the
	Miramichi but Chatham was quite unscathed.  Other articles support
	this view.</p>
	<p align="justify" style="orphans: 0; widows: 0"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify" style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">Did
	the fire include Black River?  A paper by Lillis R. Zimmer refers to
	“thirteen families who live in back of Gretna Green, and sixty
	more at Black River who were killed by the fire.”  Local lore does
	not support this view.  Had their been such a loss of life, it seems
	to me that we would have heard the story from our parents and
	grandparents.  Such an event would have been included by A. W.
	MacDougall in his history of Black River and, it is likely, that
	some of the Black River folk would have been buried in the “Black
	River” cemetery at Gunn’s Point since, by then, other settlers
	were buried there even though it was not technically a recognized
	burying ground.   Readers wishing more information may be interested
	in the following site or they may want to simply search for
	“Miramichi fire”.

	</p>
	<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">Recently I talked
	with Harold MacLean, who has a good memory and lives in the area. He
	told me the following story, which was told to him by his father.  
	</p>
	<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">Harold’s great
	grandmother was a MacNaughton, Catherine, I believe, who lived west
	of Route 11.  As a young girl, she was visiting with some relatives
	at the old MacNaughton home, John W’s father.  The old home was
	close to the river below  the John W. MacNaughton residence. 
	Harold’s home was standing at the time of the fire and was owned
	by a Thomas Murtha who happened to be away at the time of the fire. 
	Catherine and some of the MacNaughtons walked up to the Murtha home
	to see if everything was all right.  It was.</p>
	<p align="justify" style="orphans: 0; widows: 0"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify" style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">My
	conclusion, based neither on science nor research, is that there may
	have been some fire damage in the Black River area but no loss of
	life.</p>
