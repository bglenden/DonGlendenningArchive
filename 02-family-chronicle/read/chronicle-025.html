	<p align="center">The
	“MacKenzie Settlement” and “Klondike Will”</p>
	<p align="center">By</p>
	<p align="center">Barry
	R. MacKenzie</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>The lives
	of all Miramichiers have been shaped by their ancestors, but few
	families have experienced as many hardships and setbacks as the
	MacKenzies of Little Branch, Black River Bridge, New Brunswick.</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>Known as
	the MacKenzie Settlement, this area in which they lived in the
	“Hardwoods” of Little Branch was settled prior to 1851 by Hector
	MacKenzie of Tabisuntac.  Hector had immigrated to Canada in 1840
	from the small community of Assynt in Sutherland, Scotland.  He had
	been the son of a weaver, and had a brother Roderick that came to
	Canada with him in 1840.  They were also accompanied by their
	sister, Euphemia, the wife of Alexander MacKenzie, and several other
	relatives.</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>Hector was
	alone for the most part as far as family was concerned – aside
	from his children and spouse- until Roderick made the pilgrimage to
	Black River about 1852 and decided to stay.  The two brothers
	petitioned to the crown for a 100 acres each in the area in 1854,
	and from that moment on their home became known as MacKenzie
	Settlement.</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>When
	Roderick MacKenzie came to Canada in 1840, he brought with him his
	wife, Katherine, a young son John, and the will to have success in
	the wild frontier of the New World.  His stay in Tabisuntac for
	approximately twelve years saw him apply for land there, and he and
	Katherine had two additional children: Isabella, who married, and
	Annie, who remained a spinster.  The first in a long series of
	setbacks struck the family about 1845 when Katherine MacKenzie
	passed away of  causes yet unknown.  Realizing that his three young
	children needed a mother to care for them, Roderick remarried to
	Isabella MacDonald of Black River.  Although he remained in
	Tabisuntac  for a while after Katherine’s death, he took his
	family, which now consisted of two additional children, Alexander
	and Murdock, to live near brother Hector and his seemingly
	prosperous family.</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>Roderick
	and his growing family built a house on the north side of the
	MacKenzie Road opposite Hector, and began to clear the land that was
	so necessary to their survival.  The family was active in church. 
	The late George Godfrey, formerly of Black River, recalls Roderick
	and John walking down from the settlement to church on Sunday
	morning and having dinner with his family.  Hector and his family
	moved away from the settlement before 1871.</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>Isabella
	MacKenzie married Alexander MacKay and moved to the USA.  Few local
	connections exist with this branch of the family.  She died there in
	1932.  Annie remained a spinster and lived in the MacKenzie
	settlement until her death in 1918 after suffering with pneumonia.</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>Alexander
	was known to be somewhat hateful, and spent several years outside
	the county, as he is missing from two censuses in 1871 and 1881.  He
	was the last MacKenzie to live in the settlement, leaving there just
	after 1900.  He lived in a home near John and Rebecca Fowlie in
	Little Branch after that, and left much of his “wealth” to Mr.
	And Mrs. Fowlie when he died in 1920.</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>Murdock
	was very active in the church, being a trustee in 1886, as he is
	listed on a land transaction that year.  He is reputed to have been
	quite strong, as a huge boulder that sits beside the old well in the
	settlement was supposedly carried up from the ground by none other
	than Murdock himself.  In his thirty-seventh year, Murdock suddenly
	died and became the first MacKenzie buried in the Black River
	Cemetery.</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>It was the
	family of John MacKenzie, Roderick’s eldest son, that suffered the
	greatest hardships of all.  John was of a rugged constitution, and
	worked hard and long days cultivating the one-hundred acre farm he
	had applied for and was granted.  On a particular day, about 1882,
	John suffered a near-fatal fall from the loft of  his barn, and
	broke his back.  Due to the lack of medical assistance available,
	and likely to his lack of money to afford any, John’s back went
	unset, and he spent the following four years in bed, unable to move
	or do anything.  His wife, Elizabeth, the daughter of William
	McKnight, who had been born to another of the Miramichi’s great
	pioneering couples, was forced to do the farm work with the
	assistance of her daughter Kate and son. William.  When John
	MacKenzie died in bed in September 1886, he left behind a family of
	three children and a wife, who was forced to live in very isolated
	conditions, with few neighbours besides their grandparents across
	the road.  They had to manage without him.</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>The 1890’s
	hit the family hard again.  Roderick and Isabella both died in 1893.
	 In 1896, Kate, who was working in Roslindale (near Boston),
	Massachusetts, wrote home saying that she was not feeling well, and
	died of tuberculosis a few months later.  She was only twenty one
	years old.</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>The
	following year the middle child, William A. MacKenzie, who realized
	that the Miramichi held few possibilities for him, decided to head
	west on the Harvest Excursion.  He eventually worked his way out to
	British Columbia, where he spent time in the lumber woods cutting
	the great redwoods of the western forest.  The conditions of the
	primitive logging camps and the measles he contracted while in B.C.
	quite possibly contributed to his next decision.</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>Ruling out
	lumbering as the ideal job, Will resolved to travel north to Dawson
	City, Yukon, and the Gold Rush.  On May 21, 1898, W. A. MacKenzie
	landed in the Yukon off of Boat 96 from New Westminster, B. C. 
	Conditions were deplorable in the cabins at this point in history,
	and many nights he went hungry, we can be sure.  His cabin remained
	standing until the 1980’s, and photographs of it then show how
	basic and rustic it was.  There were no frills to life in the
	Klondike, no more than there had been in the Settlement back home.</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>Will
	became great friends with a man named “Black” Mike Winage, a
	well known figure of the Gold Rush, who passed away in Dawson City
	in the 1970’s at the age of 107.  Will applied for two grants for
	placer mining while panning in the Klondike, and by 1906 he had
	apparently made his fortune, because he headed home.</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>After
	traveling down through San Francisco and other parts of the U.S.,
	Klondike Will – as he became known – returned to the Mackenzie
	Settlement, only to find that his mother and sister, Janie, had
	given up the settlement and moved into Black River with James
	“Chubb” Cameron and his son Hedley.  After over 50 years of hard
	work and determination to clear the land, the settlement stood empty
	of activity once again, and most disappointingly, of MacKenzies.</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>The
	following years saw things go better for the family, as Will and
	Jane both married and lived good long lives.  Will’s family was
	raised in Napan, and his mother passed away peacefully in 1922.</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>Although
	the early years of life for the MacKenzies and their Settlement at
	Little Branch were very difficult and full of hardships, they have
	overcome it all, and have made their mark.  Will MacKenzie’s
	funeral in 1957 was one of the largest seen in this area, and his
	children became well respected citizens after him.</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>Roderick
	MacKenzie and his family showed that hardships can be overcome, and
	were better for them.  The MacKenzie Settlement is now deserted and
	grown up in alder bushes, but memories and stories linger on of
	those early days when life was simple however challenging.</p>
