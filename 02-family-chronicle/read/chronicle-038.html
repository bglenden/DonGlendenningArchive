	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>Grace
	was the oldest in the family and was born in Parksville, Tennessee. 
	Dad and Mum had set up housekeeping there in February 1911 where Dad
	worked on Ocoee #1, the first of three dams build on the Ocoee
	River.  Aunt Janet had journeyed to Parksville to be with Mum when
	Grace was born.  Later Mum and Dad moved up the Ocoee River to Caney
	Creek where a second dam was built.  (This project included the
	construction of a flume line to carry water for five  miles over
	valleys and along 
	</p>
	<p>rocky
	ledges to a head pond with a drop of 250 feet to the turbines below.
	 The flume line is designated as a national historic site.</p>

	<p align="center"><b>Grace

	at three months of age.</b></p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p> Dad
	bought the Jessie MacDonald property at Little Branch perhaps in
	time for Walter’s birth (Sept. 1913) and they move there during
	late 1913 or early 1914.  In late 1916 they moved to Fairhaven,
	Connecticut where they lived at 3 Perkins Street.  Grace would have
	attended school there. She attended the
	Armstrong School but I am not sure if it was in North Haven or
	Hampton, Virginia.</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>Later
	the family moved from Connecticut to Hampton, Virginia and Mussel
	Shoals, Alabama.  Presumably Grace went to school in both places
	before returning to Little Branch in May 1919.</p>
	<p>  
	</p>
	<p>Grace
	likely attended the Little Branch to Grade 8 or 9.  Later she
	attended Success Business College in Moncton, NB where she took a
	business program.  While she made good marks, apparently she did not
	like the program.  It was when returning from Business College with
	Grace that Dad upset the Model T at Gilbert’s Corner, near
	Shediac, and Grace broke her wrist.  Even with a broken wrist, Grace
	went to a dance in the Little Branch School that night.</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>Like
	so many other Maritimers, Grace went to Boston to work, probably in
	1930 and until she was married worked for various families,
	presumably, caring for children and doing housework.  I believe that
	she also did cooking; I know that she was a good cook. I believe
	that she traveled to Boston the first time with Mrs. F. A. Fowlie
	and Ernest MacLean who were going to Lowell, Mass to visit
	relatives.  We think that she stayed for a while with Dad’s
	cousin, Sam Knowles, when she first went to Boston.  It is likely
	that her sister, Lillian, stayed there also.  One old address we
	have is 1595 Beacon Street, Beverley, Mass. From time to time, Grace
	visited Uncle Jack Watling when he lived at Eastport, Maine near
	Portland.</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>Grace
	returned regularly to Little Branch for the summer coming sometimes
	by steamer from Boston to Saint John, NB.  (I believe that the fare
	to Saint John was $10.00).  In 1947, when I left home for Teachers’
	College in Fredericton, I inherited Grace’s steamer trunk – and
	it carried my belongings on a number of later trips.</p>

	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>As
	a young woman in Little Branch and later in Boston, Grace loved to
	square dance; perhaps that is where she met Roy Morrison Smith
	(1908-1985).   Roy, I believe, preferred to round dance.  Lillian
	said that the night she landed in Boston in 1933, she went to a
	dance with Grace.  In 1936, Walter, Dad, Elinor and I drove to
	Boston to bring Grace home.  She and Roy were married in St. Paul’s
	Presbyterian Church on August 26, 1936.  They had two children,
	Barbara and Lawrence.</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>After
	marriage, Grace and Roy lived with Roy’s mother in Saugus, Mass,
	later moving to 23 Spring Street in Malden.  One evening while
	standing on the sidewalk near her home in Malden talking to a
	neighbour, a man came along, knocked her off her feet and stole her
	purse.  While in Saugus, Grace worked for Chisholm’s Motel on
	Route 1.</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>Grace,
	Roy and family were frequent visitors to Little Branch and even when
	they could not come, their children made the trip.  My recollection
	is that Barbara and Lawrence spent 16 consecutive summers with their
	Grandmother at Little Branch.  Often they came by train but also
	frequently traveled with expatriate New Brunswick folk who were
	visiting family in the Miramichi.  I can remember being wakened in
	the middle of the night when Grace arrived home.  She had brought
	some clothes for me and wanted to see them on me.  The story is told
	that one summer when Grace was home and helping with the cooking and
	Ken was a toddler, Grace would jam Ken’s dress in the pantry door
	in order to keep him out of her way</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>In
	later years, Grace frequently landed home carrying shopping bags
	with fresh tomatoes from Roy’s garden, bagels for Jean MacKenzie
	and the usual things for family members.  
	</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>Grace
	had extraordinary eyesight. While walking through a field she could
	reach down and pick a four leaf clover.  One time she entered a
	contest, which required her to count the dots in a picture of a TV. 
	She won, and then decided she should count the dots again in case
	she was asked the number at the presentation ceremony.  I know that
	she also won other contests but cannot recall which ones.  As a
	youngster, I can recall going with Grace and others to pick
	blueberries and raspberries and of walking through the fields.  I am
	not sure if we were going somewhere or just for a walk. 
	</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>Although
	she left New Brunswick as a young woman, she did not lose interest
	in family, friends or the community.  She subscribed to the Chatham
	Gazette for many years and was well informed about activities among
	her extended family.</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>She
	was proud of her family, fiercely loyal, generous to a fault and she
	and Roy always welcomed and provided shelter for the many visiting
	family members.  She was quick to arrange for visitors to see the
	Museum of Science, visit down town Boston, see the Saugus Iron
	works, etc.</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>During
	Christmas of 1957, before I was married, Carol and I came to Boston
	and stayed a few days with Grace and Roy.  Gerald Taylor traveled to
	Boston with me and spent Christmas with Grace, Roy and family.</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>During
	her later years Grace had a form of multiple sclerosis and had
	difficulty walking.  She then moved to Cliffside Nursing Home and
	Winthrop, Mass.  She is buried in the Black River Cemetery.</p>
