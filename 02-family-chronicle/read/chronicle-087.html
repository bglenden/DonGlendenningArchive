<p>The Gleaner of Chatham, NB in 1833 carried mostly international news, shipping information, and advertisements, however, on June 25, 1833 the Gleaner carried the following “ORIGINAL” item:</p>
<p><b>BLACK RIVER</b></p>
<p>Two steep banks of this river, once clad to the brink with lofty trees, that looked frowningly down upon its deep, but narrow channel, threw over its surface a bright black shade – from which circumstances I doubt not, it derived the name of “BLACK RIVER.” <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In winding along its serpentine channel, it is enlarged by several tributary streams, that roll themselves into it; the principal of which is called the Little Branch: this stream crosses the Richibucto road, at Queen’s tavern, and running in an Easterly direction, empties itself into the main river, about a mile from the Baie des Vent Bay; into the upper side of which Black River discharges itself into the Miramichi.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Early settlers were led to draw lands from Government, on the banks of the river, with the twofold intention of Lumbering and Agriculture.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Experience, however, has taught us, that the wild occupations and habits of the Lumberer, are so much at variance with the mild, domestic engagements of the Husbandman, that to be the successful one, it is impossible to be the other:<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>thus was Agriculture neglected on Black River.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>By the time the winter’s timber was rafted, and brought to market and the tangible part of its price squandered in carousing in the tavern, little time, and less inclination remained for improvement of the farm.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But mark the wonderful change wrought not only in the life, but in the civil and religious character of the Black River settler, during the transpiration of the last few years.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>While without roads, bridges, and mills; with a pick-axe and spade, as the substitutes for the plough and the harrow, and the rough barrow for the useful cart, it could hardly be wondered that under such disadvantages he should have preferred that employment to which the whole country fondly, but foolishly clung – an employment slow and deceitful in leading its votaries on to ruin, yet has seldom failed to bring them to debt and destruction.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Since 1825, roads have been opened – bridges and mills erected – lumbering has been nearly abandoned, and agriculture warmly pursued.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The wild, half barbarous trade of timbering has been forgotten in the retired and tranquil engagements of the farm.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The land holders in Black River are principally Scotch Highlanders, grown old in the land of their adoption, but warm lovers of the country that gave them birth, and that language (Galic) in which they first learned to lisp their Maker’s and their Country’s praise.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Lately benighted in traveling along the banks of the Black river, I was kindly invited to stay ‘til morning, at the house of a venerable old resident.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Fatigued with the labours of the day the family were wearedly returning from the field, while the old man and I approached their dwelling.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As we entered, the old Dame with ‘kindly welcome’ greeted us severally, and directed us to ‘sit in’ and partake of the smoking repast prepared only for the bairns, as she said.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Supper ended, and having ascertained tha all things had been duly attended to, the old man reverently waved his wrinkled hand, and in Gallic said, ‘let us worship god.’<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Each one kneeling, the Sage began solemnly and slowly to supplicate Divine Grace upon the assembled ‘two or three;’ fervently dwelt upon the many blessings with which Heaven had crowned their industry, and forgot not, to be grateful, that altho’ a people scattered in the forest and remote from gospel instruction, yet a benign and omniscient Providence had not been unmindful of them.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A Shepherd of Israel now frequently visits their dwellings, and by his visions, points the way from Hell to Heaven,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Thus lives the humble settler of Black River.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>‘The world o’erlooks him in her busy track</p>
<p>Of objects more illustrious, in her view;</p>
<p>And occupied as earnestly as she,</p>
<p>Though more sublimely, he o’erlooks the world’</p>
<p>OBSERVER</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>From my reading, Black River included some of the settlement east of Victoria Bridge.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Most of the grants along the Little Branch were dated June 3, 1812; a decade later much of the land on both sides of the Black River had been granted including grants to the MacNaughtons in the Upper Black River area.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>By the mid 1830s, most of the crown land along the River had been granted and settlement was beginning in the Meadows.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is likely that many settlers were already living on their land before title was officially transferred. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
