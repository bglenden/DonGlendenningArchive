	<p>A photo of
	the Avro Anson taken at the Air Museum in Ottawa.  Avro Ansons were
	used at No. 10 A.O. S  (Air Observer School) which was part of the
	Chatham Air Force Base during WW2.  All the aircraft at both No. !0
	AOS and No. 21 EFTS were painted a bright yellow presumably for easy
	spotting in the air and should they crash.</p>

	</p>
	<h6 align="justify" style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">Portland</h6>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">While we do not know the year Dad
	went to Portland, we now have proof that he was living there in
	1901.  Proof is in the form of a certificate admitting him to Lodge
	No. 117 of the Independent Order of Odd-fellows.  He would have been
	26 years old at the time.</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<h6 align="justify" style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">Spending
	Money</h6>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">While in high school, there were
	not many opportunities to earn spending money.  While I cannot
	recall having an allowance, neither can I recall being without money
	to do the things I wanted to do.   
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">I recall searching the Family
	Herald and Weekly Star, a weekly newspaper found in every farm home,
	and finding a company, Warco Grease and Oil in or near Toronto
	(Dundas or Dundas Street perhaps)  Their specialty was graphite
	grease and oil.  I became an agent for them and would order cases,
	quarts and gallons, of oil and grease and retail them to family and
	neighbours.  
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">My two largest orders, as I
	recall, were a barrel of oil ordered by Uncle Jack (John W.)
	MacNaughton for use in his sawmill.  I remember phoning Uncle Jack
	and asking if he was interested in trying it.  He asked quite a few
	questions and then said “yes”.  I assume that he bought it to be
	kind.  
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">The other was an order of paint
	by my brother, Walter, to paint his house.  ($5.00) per gallon) 
	Through my business, I brought the first paint rollers to Black
	River.  I remember seeing them listed in the catalogue and ordering
	a couple on a trial basis.  So you can see that I was on the cutting
	edge of technology of the day.</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">It was interesting and it did
	give me some spending money.  I had expected to make my first
	million through that business.  When it became obvious that my first
	million was out of reach, I changed objectives and started working
	towards my second million.  I’ve given up on that also and am now
	workikng on my third million.</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<h6 align="justify" style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">Follow-up</h6>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">Brother Ken remembers A. T.
	Patstone was principal of MRHS but we are not sure of Mr. Armstrong.</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">Brother Ken also remembered that
	a pilot was killed in the plane crash in Black River – the crash
	at Herb MacDonald’s lane.  It was a snowy day but not windy, we
	were at MRHS and, on the way home, the school bus stopped and we all
	walked in the lane to the crash site.  The plane went into a
	tailspin.</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify"><b>Cow bells</b></p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">Farms were not fenced; cows were
	allowed to run loose and, as I recall, you fenced the fields to keep
	cows out of gardens and grain for example, rather than to keep them
	in.  Cows often traveled quite a distance from their owner’s
	place.  Farmers would have a half-dozen or more cows each.  Each
	farmer attached a bell to at least one cow so their whereabouts
	would be known.  When milking time arrived, one listened for the
	sound of the cowbell for your cows.  Sometimes cows from a number of
	herds would feed together.  By listening, one could location of cows
	belonging to you.  
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">As car and truck traffic
	increased, cows would sometime dart on to the road, be struck by a
	car, and be killed.  When this happened, it was the driver, not the
	farmer, who was at fault.  I recall once when John struck a heifer
	down in Hardwicke.  The animal was killed, or so badly injured that
	they killed it, then brought it home to be dressed. 
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">Eventually herd law was
	introduced.  That meant that farmers had to fence their animals.  If
	an animal strayed on to the road and was struck by a car, it was the
	farmer not the auto driver who was at fault.  I used to worry when
	bringing cows home from the “Finno field”, nearly a half mile
	away, that one would jump in front of a car.  It only happened once.</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">For some reason, we were using a
	gate at the bottom of Ken’s Hill rather than the usual gate at the
	top.  I drove the cows out the gate onto the road.  Just then, a big
	truck, 3 ton or more, appeared at the top of Ken’s hill.  Of
	course, coming down the hill, it took longer to stop than on the
	level.  The front bumper actually struck a cow’s leg but did no
	damage.  I was a frightened little boy, I can tell you.  This is the
	first time I ever told the story.  I guess I was afraid that I would
	be blamed if a cow had been hurt or killed.</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify"><b>A Yoke and a Humble Cow</b></p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">Not all cows thought the grass in
	the field was best.  Some wanted to eat the forbidden hay on the
	other side of the fence.  Some times this was by necessity if the
	summer was dry and the pasture was bare.  Some times a cow would
	push against the fence and, in fact, push through.  To prevent this,
	a yoke was made around the cow’s neck.  A yoke was made by nailing
	three small pieces of board together to form a triangle.  If a cow
	tried to push through a fence, the yoke came up against the wire.</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">Once,
	we had a humble cow.  She was a big, young Holstein.  Humble meant
	having no horns.  Whether this was from birth or a man-made state I
	cannot recall,</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />
