<p>No.23										November 24, 2001<span><span class="Apple-converted-space">                                                                                                                        </span>__________</span></p>
<p><span></span>The previous newsletter listed names of relatives who served in a branch of the military.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In this news letter, I decided to jot down some wartime recollections.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><span>I</span> recognize that what I say may not even be accurate but these jottings are my recollections.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>These notes are in random order.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I was age 10 when war was declared.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I recall<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>discussions in the schoolyard about the war and if we might be attacked.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>We were encouraged to save old newspapers and tin foil (?).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We bought loose tea in packages with metallic (lead) covering.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We always saved the lead.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I recall this material stacked in the entry way of the Little Branch school.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Ken had gone to Moncton to enlist.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He phoned Mother to say that he would be passing through Newcastle that night on his way to Toronto.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Walter (?) drove Mum to Newcastle to see Ken on the way through.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I was in the Miramichi Rural on June 6, 1944 when a car came to the school to pick up Francis MacNaughton.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>His father was killed on D-Day in the Normandy landing.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A hush fell over the school and the school bus later in the afternoon..</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Vance MacNaughton said that he was in the Little Branch School on<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>May 8, 1945 when the school door flew open.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My mother entered unannounced to shout to all that the war was over in Europe.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Some items were rationed including sugar and sugar products, oil, gas, butter, tea (?).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We had our coupon books and a coupon was removed every time we made a purchase.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Because we lived on a<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>farm and there were a number in the family, rationing was never a problem.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>For a while John had a big truck and therefore had extra stamps for gasoline.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Roy Watling stopped at our house one cold winter night on his way home from purchasing gallon of molasses in a glass bottle.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He proudly displayed his purchase which he may have been able to get with less than the normal required stamps.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He went on home.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Later we learned that Aunt Kate had been housecleaning and had changed the location of a chair.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was now just inside the front door.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When Roy stepped in, the cold glass bottle of molasses struck the chair and shattered.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Need I say more?</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Military vehicles were often seen on our roads and would occasionally stop at the house to ask directions.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I was told once that officers were paid $5.00 per day.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That seemed a pretty exorbitant wage.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Canadians were encouraged to purchase war saving bonds and war saving stamps.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The latter, as I recall were 25 cents each.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Mum bought bonds and encouraged us to buy stamps.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She also made a deal whereby I received saving stamps for delivering phone messages to Alex MacDonald who did not have a telephone.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Alex worked on dredges and around wharves.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As I recall, he worked for man with a French name who lived in Buctouche or Richibucto.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He often phoned our place to get a message to Alex.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A few days after I delivered a message, I would receive two war saving stamps in the mail.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We stuck them in a stamp book and turned them in when we had 40 stamps.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The women of the community knit socks and mitts for soldiers - and not just for immediate family members.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Also, and especially at Christmas, boxes would be sent to solders overseas.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Into the boxes would go socks, mitts, fudge, and canned goods.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Fruitcake and cookies were favourite.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>People also wrote letters to soldiers even though they did not know them<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Ken brought an airman from south east British Columbia with him at Christmas, 1942.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The Chatham airport was the home to #10 Air Observer School and #31 Elementary Flying Training School.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The first used Avro Ansons and the latter used a bi-wing plane - a Moth maybe.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The Miramichi area was designated a low-flying area and it was not unusual for landing gear to catch on radio aerials at farm homes in the area.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>One pilot actually flew under the Newcastle Bridge.</p>
<p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A plane crashed one snowy winter day about half way in Herb MacDonald<span>=</span>s lane.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The bus from school stopped at the end of the lane on the way home and we walked in to the crash site.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I do not think that anyone was killed</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Another crash occurred in mid-summer at Alf MacLean<span>=</span>s shore where one airman was killed - a man by the name of Neilly, I think.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There were two in the plane following the course of the Little Branch River below Fowlie<span>=</span>s Mill when one wing clipped a tree.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I believe Harry MacLean was first at the scene.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>A practice bombing range was cleared east of the road between Napan and Loggieville.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The woods was cleared and targets were built.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My recollection is that targets were wooden platforms build 2-3 feet off the ground.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>If a plane crashed in the area, people were asked to report any sightings which might be related.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I remember taking turns sitting at the window in the down stairs bedroom looking out the window looking for flares.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I built model airplanes from balsa-wood kits and powered by rubber bands.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I built a Spitfire, a<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Norduyn Norseman and one other.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The Spitfire would lift off the floor in the length of the kitchen.</p>
