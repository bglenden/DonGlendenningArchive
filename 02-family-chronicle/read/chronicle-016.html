<p><b>Happy New Year</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>I<span>=</span>ve been doing some work on Carol<span>=</span>s side of the family so will share a few notes.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Ancestral Names</b><b></b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Direct ancestral names on Carol<span>=</span>s side include Chesney, McChesney, Scott Merritt, Murphy, Frank, Vogt, Walder, Unrah, <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>William McChesney, Carol<span>=</span>s GGGG Grandfather, was born in Scotland and came to Maryland about 1740.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>His son, Benjamin, seems to have used the name Chesney and not McChesney.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Later Chesneys lived in Virginia before moving to Illinois between 1831 when he was born and 1856 when he married Huldah Desiree Merritt.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Theodore Kaifer, Carol G Grandfather, was born in Germany in 1825 and moved to Illinois before 1855 when his daughter, Mary Anita, was born.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>J.J. Frank, another GGG Grandfather was born in Rinich, Bavaria on April 24, 1734.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>His son, John Jacob and Grandson, Henry, were both born in Bavaria;<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>the Grandson came to Illinois between 1834 when he was born and 1863 when he was married. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Lincoln Connection</b><b></b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Family lore says that Carol<span>=</span>s Grandmother, Flora Elizabeth Murphy, was a cousin of Abraham Lincoln.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>American Revolution</b><b></b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Carol<span>=</span>s GGG Grandfather, Benjamin Chesney<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>enlisted as a soldier in the <span>A</span>Revolutionary War<span>@</span> (against Britain) in May, 1775 and served for 6 years.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He was in a number of battles in Maryland including Brandywine, Stony Point, and<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Guildford<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Courthouse.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>(There are other names of skirmishes but I cannot decipher them.)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He was wounded in the leg.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>In 1818 he petitioned for, and was granted, a pension of eight dollars a month.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In his petition, he states that he did not receive discharge papers because his officer did not have money to buy paper and that he was disabled and could not make a living.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Successful Farmers</b><b></b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Early settlers in the US settled along the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>East coast. In the 1800's, there was a great migration of Americans and immigrants to the west including Illinois and later all the way to the Pacific shore.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The Chesneys, Kaifers and Franks were part of that movement.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Land was fertile and cheap ($1.00 per acre).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They seemed to have prospered - at least the Kaifers and Chesneys.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I know little about the other ancestors.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In later years they planted mostly corn and soybeans.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The Kaifers soon gathered large tracts of farmland; Theodore Kaifer, the original immigrant, gave each of his children, and there were six, 80 acres of land when they came of age and the land appears to have stayed in the family for the next 100 years.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Carol<span>=</span>s Grandfather, William Chesney, was engaged in farming but also bought cattle , brought them to Illinois, fattened and sold them.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Carol<span>=</span>s father also farmed.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Carol</b><span><b>=</b></span><b>s parents</b><b></b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Carol<span>=</span>s father, Ernest Merritt Chesney, was born in 1903 and was the youngest of six children.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He graduated from Princeton<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>High School in 1924; was a good student and a member of the debating team.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Carol<span>=</span>s mother, Lola Irene Kaifer, was born in 1903 and was the younger of two children.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She graduated from Henry High School in 1924 and went to Northwestern University on a scholarship.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She was a good student, an accomplished pianist, a champion tennis player and knew several languages.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Ernest and Lola were married in 1927 and moved, I think, her father<span>=</span>s farm and later to his father<span>=</span>s farm.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Marjorie was born in 1930 and Carol in 1936.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Carol<span>=</span>s mother died a week after Carol was born.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Her father had a housekeeper for a couple of years then Marjorie went to live with her Aunt Electa Hunt in Milwaukee and Carol went to live with her aunt, Esther Jardine in Peoria.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Ernest died in 1943.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Grammie Jardine</b><b></b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Esther (Chesney) Jardine was born on May 9, 1895 in Tiskilwa, Illinois.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Her father was one of the first, if not the first, in the community to own an automobile.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Grammie Jardine, as a young girl of 16, would drive him around as he bought and sold cattle.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Edmund and Esther (Chesney) Jardine moved to Peoria in 1933 where Edmund<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>managed a local grocery chain.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Later he worked for</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Caterpillar Tractor Co.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Grammie worked at Block and Kuhl and Carsons in the ladies<span>=</span> wear department after Ed died, first on a full-time basis and later part time.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She was active in the Eastern Star, a literary club, a member of Westminster Presbyterian Church and played the piano.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>She continued to live alone and drove her own car until she was 90 years of age; then she fell and broke a hip and soon moved to the Lutheran Home in Peoria.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>After her husband died, her brother in law, Bill Jardine, moved into basement apartment so that she always had company in the house.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She died on December 1, 1992 at age 971/2.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Longevity</b><b></b></p>

<p>On the Frank side, ages were: Aunt Kitty - 104; Aunt Freda - 94; Uncle William - 102; Uncle George - 87; Uncle Jacob - 100; one other Uncle - 100.</p>
