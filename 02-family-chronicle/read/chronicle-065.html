	<p>Another
	snow scene - Little Branch Road, just above home, on April 16, 1961</p>
	<p><br />

	<h6 align="justify" style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">Another
	Snow Story</h6>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">With
	snow on the side of the road, roads were often mini lakes when
	spring came.  When walking, people would step on to the bank to walk
	past the puddle.  
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">On
	one such occasion, Mrs. Harper was walking above our place.  The
	banks were not as high as in the photo.  She stepped up on the bank.
	 As she walked her feet began to break through the snow.  The snow
	was soft and packed easily.  Each time she tried to lift one foot
	out of the snow, the other would cut in.</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">George
	and I must have been playing near by because I remember helping dig
	her foot out of the snow and walk past the pool of water.</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<h6 align="justify" style="widows: 0; orphans: 0"></h6>
	<h6 align="justify" style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">The
	Sound of Running Water</h6>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">Running
	water brings different thought to the mind of different people.  It
	often reminds me of the spring run-off down our hill.</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">Above
	our place the land was flat and gathered water.  Puddles were pools
	when the snow was melting.  Banks of snow on the sides of the road
	and shallow ditches kept the water on the road and soon it was
	running down the centre of the road.  Soon the road would begin to
	wash out.</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">The
	men would dig a ditch/trench over top of the ditch to get the water
	to run there.  Running water soon cut through the snow and kept the
	water off the road.  Culverts at the end of lanes posed a problem
	because sometimes they were frozen full.</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify" style="page-break-after: avoid"><b>A
	January Thaw</b></p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">Reports
	of warming weather reminds me of a January thaw.  In 1946.  I think
	it was January but it could have been later, I was in Grade eleven
	which was the last year of high school.  All my older brothers were
	away; Ken and John were working for Hubert Matchett in the woods at
	Sunny Corner; Norm may have been up there at the time also.  
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">Anyway,
	I was at home doing the chores and attending school.  One morning
	about 6:00 am I arose, started a fire and headed for the barn to
	feed and milk the cows.  In my right hand, I had a lantern (this was
	a couple of years before electricity arrived in Black River); under
	my right arm I was holding three milk pails.</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">It
	had rained in the night.  Not only was the barn yard a sheet of ice,
	it was wet ice and very slippery (Or was it slippy?).  I stepped off
	the back step and after two or three strides, my feet went out from
	under me.  I was flat on my back still holding the lantern altugh
	the milk pails had slithered across the yard.  Not a problem.  I
	gathered everything up again and walked gingerly across the yard to
	the safety of the cow barn.  The return trip with full pails of milk
	was less spectacular.</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<h6 align="justify" style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">Watlings
	at the Meadows</h6>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">Janet
	Watling asked recently about the early Watlings at the Meadows.  It
	is confusing because, as we know, there were at least three Jubal
	Watlings.</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">Jubal
	1 married Susan Leach.  I have no evidence that they came to Canada
	or Black River.</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify" style="orphans: 2; widows: 2">A
	Jubal Watling, I believe to be Jubal 2 married to Christina
	MacNaughton, <b>
	 </b>
	petitioned (F4243) for 50 acres of land “situate as follows: on
	the South side of Black River adjoining south of William McBeath’s
	meadow<u>
	</u>lot
	and east of a lot applied for by John Edge.  The petition is dated
	at Chatham on April 9, 1851 and includes Jubal’s signature.  The
	property was vacant, surveyed but without improvements.  Other hand
	written notes on the page are confusing in that they show apparent
	approval on May 21/1851 and Auction, August 51&quot;.  The papers
	are signed by Peters, the  Deputy Surveyor.  Lot number not given.</p>
	<p lang="en-GB" align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.17in">The
	New Brunswick Crown Lands Grant Index shows a grant of 100 acres
	located at A30 BL. 15 SE SD Black River, Glenelg Parish
	Northumberland County to Jubal Watling, Jr. on April 20, 1884.
	(Recorded in vol. 105, No.18287)</p>
	<p lang="en-GB" align="justify" style="orphans: 2; widows: 2">
	<br />

	</p>
	<p lang="en-GB" align="justify">This
	is located in an area known as the Meadows - a name that has long
	since disappeared.  This, I believe, is Jubal 3 who married Grace
	MacDonald.  Jubal and Grace moved to Little Branch, in 1900 or 1901
	to the place where Neil Watling now lives.  
	</p>
	<p lang="en-GB" align="justify"><br />

	<p align="justify">According
	to the New Brunswick Land Grants Index, neighbours in the Meadows
	starting at Route 11 were:</p>

	believe there was a road to the Meadows along the south side of the
	Black River starting at Route 11. Ken remembers visiting the
	property.  I think that I was there once picking blueberries.  At
	that time a mound for the old root cellar still could be seen. The
	old property has reverted to forest and the community has
	disappeared.  The forests have now reclaimed whatever fields were
	cleared.  </span><span lang="en-GB"><b>
