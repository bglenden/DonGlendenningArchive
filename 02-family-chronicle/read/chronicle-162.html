<p><b>History of the Apron:</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>This as sent to me some time ago but unfortunately, I cannot remember by whom.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The principal use of Grandma's apron was to protect the dress underneath, but along with that, it served as a potholder for removing hot pans from the oven.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>It was wonderful for drying children's tears, and on occasionally was even used for cleaning out dirty ears.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>From the chicken coop, the apron was used for carrying eggs, fussy chicks, and sometimes half-hatched eggs to be finished in the warming oven.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>When company came, those aprons were ideal hiding places for shy kids.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>And when the weather was cold, grandma wrapped it around her arms.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Those big old aprons wiped many a perspiring brow, bent over the hot wood stove.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Chips and kindling wood were brought into the kitchen in that apron.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>From the garden, it carried all sorts of vegetables. After the peas had been shelled, it carried out the hulls.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>In the fall, the apron was used to bring in apples that had fallen from the trees.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>When unexpected company drove up the road, it was surprising how much furniture that old apron could dust in a matter of seconds.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>When dinner was ready, Grandma walked out onto the porch, waved her apron, and the men knew it was time to come in from the fields to dinner</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>It will be a long time before someone invents something that will replace that 'old-time apron' that served so many purposes</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Send this to those who would know, and love the story about Grandma's aprons.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>REMEMBER:</b><b></b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Grandma used to set her hot baked apple pies on the window sill to cool</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Her granddaughters set theirs on the window sill to thaw.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>They would go crazy now trying to figure out how many germs were on that apron.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I don't think I ever caught anything from an apron.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p><b>For genealogists  </b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Thanks to Irma Downing for this list of<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>New Year’s resolutions of yesteryear that frustrate genealogists of today.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><i>“It is New Year's Eve, 1852 and John Smith sits at his desk  by<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>candlelight. He dips his quill pen in ink and begins to writes  his New Year's resolutions:<br>
1.  No man is  truly well-educated unless he learns to spell his name at least three  different ways within the same document.  I resolve to give &gt;&gt; the appearance of being extremely well-educated in the coming  year.<br>
2.  I resolve to see to it that all of my children will  have the same names that my ancestors have used for six generations in  a row.<br>
3.  My age is no one's business but my own.  I  hereby resolve to never list the same age or birth year twice on any  document.<br>
4.  I resolve to have each of my children baptized in a  different church -- either in a different faith or in a different  parish.   Every third child will not be baptized at all, or will be baptized by an itinerant minister who keeps no records.<br>
5.  I resolve to move  to a new town, new county, or new state at least once every 10 years -- just  before those pesky enumerators come around asking silly  questions.<br>
6.  I will make every attempt to reside in counties and  towns where no vital records are maintained or where the courthouse burns  down every few years.<br>
7.  I resolve to join an obscure religious  cult that does not believe in record keeping or in participating in military  service.<br>
8.  When the tax collector comes to my door, I'll loan him  my pen, which has been dipped in rapidly fading blue ink.<br>
9.  I  resolve that if my beloved wife Mary should die, I will marry another  Mary.<br>
10.  I resolve not to make a will.  Who needs to spend  money on a lawyer.</i></p>
<p><i>11.  I resolve to not clutter up the good  farm pasture with headstones, that will just get broken or fade with time  anyway.<br>
12.  I resolve to protect my family and friends privacy,  by giving false names and places for events.<br>
13.  I resolve to  never give the correct accounts of misdeeds in the family, so when Uncle Lem  shot that fellow and was tried  for murder, my children will be told he stole a cow.<br>
14.   I resolve to never trim the family cemetery of brush and tangle weed, to keep  out any one doing that silly Genealogical work.<br>
15.  I resolve to  always alternate my child's and wife's first and middle names when the census  taker comes around, just to give him practice with his  spelling.<br>
16.  I resolve to come from Ireland (where there are no  records, or, if there are, they can only be examined by visiting the  exact village and, <br>
&gt;&gt; pleading with the local clergy, (who is hostile to anyone  not of his belief, which of course you are) and/or handing over a  fee equal to or exceeding your yearly income for one hour's research which  may not <br>
find anything.)<br>
17.  I resolve that not only shall I NOT die  in my country of birth, nor shall my children (yea verily) unto the sixth  generation.<br>
18.  I resolve that I shall call my children by odd  names which the enumerator shall spell incorrectly.<br>
19.  I  resolve that I shall be absent on the night of the census.<br>
20.  I  resolve that if unable to be absent on census night I shall endeavor to be  enumerated twice.<br>
21.  I resolve that when I die my children/wife  are instructed to give the wrong details for my death  certificate.<br>
22.  I resolve that I and most of my family shall die  suddenly just before death certifications started to be used, in a parish  where easy access to the records ceased the previous  year.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></i><i></i></p>
