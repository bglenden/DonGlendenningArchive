	Graduation Photos</h6>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>George
	Watling tells me that the above 
	</p>
	<p>photo was taken at the home of Frances MacLean. 
	Perley Quayle, Principal of MRHS, drove the graduates to the MacLean
	home in his Model A Coupe.  George rode in the rumble seat.</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; text-indent: -0.5in"><i><b>Note:	I
	would be delighted to receive graduation photos for 1941, 1943 and
	1944 to run in future issues of the Chronicle.</b></i></p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p><b>Clothes
	(Cont’d)</b></p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>Rubber
	boots were standard wear around the barn (Work boots were for
	farming, haying, working on the boats, etc).  Rubber boots were knee
	high and had a narrow red band around the top – perhaps a
	half-inch wide.  One of the weak areas of rubber boots was at the
	ankles. Presumably because of the frequent flexing, boots often
	cracked there.</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>Gumboots
	were standard wear for fall, winter and spring.  They were made like
	rubber boots only ankle high.  Obviously the snow would get in
	winter and wet feet soon smelled.</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>Finally, I
	recall my real leather winter boots, which laced up and were higher
	than gumboots.  The snow and wet were hard on them and one treated
	them regularly with a paste wax – Skowhegan, as I recall.  This
	kept the leather soft but also made them more waterproof.</p>
	<p>An earlier
	Chronicle dealt with the heavy woolen pants of winter and especially
	the high quality of Humphrey pants.</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>We always
	wore long underwear, long johns, in winter.  Some were two –piece
	and some were one-piece.  Woolen were best because they absorbed the
	sweat but they were very itchy.  Some men wore long woolen underwear
	both summer and winter.  They said that the wool kept them cool in
	the summer and warm in the winter.  I’m not convinced   It seems
	as though I usually had fleece-lined long johns.  Of course, all
	long johns came equipped with a small front entrance and a large
	trap door in the rear.</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>Hands were
	covered with mitts when the weather warranted.  Mother knitted mitts
	and socks for all of us.  Depending on what else she was doing, she
	could knit a pair of socks in a day while she was “resting”.</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>I often
	think of the hard work for mother just washing and cleaning all of
	our clothes when water was pumped by hand, heated on a wood stove,
	washed by hand, rinsed with a hand operated wringer, hung to dry on
	a clothesline outdoors and ironed where necessary again by hand.</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<h6 style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">Telephone Service</h6>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>Black
	River was served primarily by the New Brunswick Telephone Company;
	on the other side of the Little Branch River and all the way to
	Escuminac, phone service was provided by the “Government line”. 
	
	</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>The
	Government Line always seemed to be out of order.  That meant that
	people from down river frequently came to our house to use the
	phone; that also meant that emergency phone calls often came to our
	place with a request that they be delivered.  I cannot ever remember
	delivery being refused.  In fact, I remember delivering a phone
	message to someone up Bay du Vin River over very wet, muddy and
	rutted spring roads.</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>Ours was a
	party line; our number was 1900-4 – nineteen hundred ring four. 
	Nineteen hundred was the exchange; 4 was the ring.  When the phone
	rang four short rings, we knew to pick it up.  Double-digit numbers
	were rung by dialing long and short rings.  Number twenty-four, for
	example, would be two long rings and four short rings.</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>The phone
	itself was a box about 10 inches wide, 20 inches high and six inches
	deep.  The receiver hung on a y-hook; you lifted the receiver off
	the hook and held it to your ear.  The phone was battery powered –
	two C batteries as I recall. Once or twice a year, telephone
	maintenance men changed the batteries.</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>When the
	phone rang, it was possible to pick up the phone and listen to both
	sides of the conversation.  This was a great way to catch up on the
	news and prevented secrets in the community.  In case of an
	emergency, such as a fire, a continuous ring would be heard to alert
	the neighbours.</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>The story
	is told of a neighbour who tied the receiver to her rocking chair
	each time she sat down to rest.  The Telephone Company threatened to
	disconnect a phone if someone listened in on a conversation although
	I never heard of that happening except in the above instance.</p>

	on the family website.   It is designed to share information about
	my family, community and the times in which I grew up.  While every
	effort is made to be accurate, errors are likely to occur.
