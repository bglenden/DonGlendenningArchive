	<ul>
		<li><p align="justify">Was
		in touch with descendants of all five of the original Harley
		siblings, of which my Great Grandmother, Margaret (Harley) was one.
		 All five arrived in New Brunswick from Ireland in the 1820’s.  
		My Email address book, two hundred years later, includes one or
		more descendants from each branch.</p></li>
		<li><p align="justify">Learned
		the exact date, January 24, 1908, that my mother landed in Portland
		from New Brunswick. It was the day the Portland City hall burned; a
		phone call to the Portland City library confirmed the date  
		</p></li>
		<li><p align="justify">Realized
		how few photos of early farm equipment exist in family albums. 
		Following the issue on “sleds”, a lady from Minnesota Emailed
		me asking for a photo.</p></li>
		<li><p align="justify">Heard
		from a caregiver in Germany, who contacted me on behalf of her
		patient, seeking the name of a female Glendenning he had met many
		years earlier.  Unfortunately, I was not able to be helpful.</p></li>
		<li><p align="justify">Realize
		that the names on the flyleaf of my Great Grandfather Glendinning’s
		siblings were real people.  I now have information on two others
		from that page, and had direct correspondence with descendants of
		one.  
		</p></li>
		<li><p align="justify">Found
		a “real” fourth cousin, Eva (Williston) Dorn now living in
		California; we are related through the MacNaughtons</p></li>
		<li><p align="justify">Received
		many enquiries from readers and was able to put some in touch with
		their roots.</p></li>
		<li><p align="justify">Heard
		from Uncle Jack Watling’s step granddaughter, named Jacqueline
		after Uncle Jack, who filled in some blanks about Uncle Jack.</p></li>
		<li><p align="justify">Realize
		that there were four distinct Glendinning/Glendenning families from
		Dumfriesshire, Scotland who came to New Brunswick in the early
		1800’s; they  settled in Canobie, St. John, Galloway near Rexton
		and Big River near Bathurst.  Although all came from Dumfriesshire,
		I was not able to establish a family linkage.</p></li>
		<li><p align="justify">Was
		able to link descendants of the Glendennings of Galloway, NB with
		cousins in Scotland.</p></li>
		<li><p align="justify">Always
		thought that Glendenning was a rare name, but soon changed my mind
		when I started looking for Watling relatives.</p></li>
		<li><p align="justify">Found
		that the earliest Jubal Watling, married to Susan Leach, lived on
		Prince Edward Island, married again and had another family.  
		</p></li>
		<li><p align="justify">Learned
		that ancestors of the MacBeaths of Moncton were among the original
		settlers in Upper Black River. (Our first home after we were
		married was in the home of Ron MacBeath, 735 Mountain Road,
		Moncton, NB.</p></li>
		<li><p align="justify">Learned
		that lore of many families includes reference to a brother of the
		original immigrants who went west and was never heard of again.

	<p><b>Dear
	Readers:</b></p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>I’m
	winding up a number of writing projects at the present time: Family
	Chronicle, Recollections of my Holland College Years and reports
	from my family database.  I f time permits, I may also put pen to
	paper to record some thoughts on education.  We’ll see.  In the
	meantime, I will draw this initiative to a close with issue 200.</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>I
	am indebted to many people for suggesting items, for answering my
	calls for help, and just for keeping in touch.  Whoever you are and
	wherever you live, relative, friend and reader alike, thank you one
	and all.</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>A
	copy of Volume One, the First 100 was deposited with both the
	Chatham Library and the New Brunswick Archives; I’ll do the same
	with this volume.  If interested, I’d be glad to provide print
	copies at cost.  Send me an email.</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>If
	any readers are seeking information about family roots and think
	that I can help, please do not hesitate to contact me. 
	</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>I would be
	delighted to remain in touch with readers; send an email or check my
	website to see if anything further develops.</p>
	<p style="margin-left: 0.25in"><br />

	</p>
	<p><b>Thanks
	and warm wishes to all.</b></p>
