</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Don recalls school-era memories and historical minutiae. Includes a 1943-44 photo of Tom Adams with his daughter Doris and their school bus (likely a modified Ford)—Tom later received a plaque for 40 accident-free years of driving. Don rode the bus back to Little Branch while teaching at Miramichi Rural High School. Also discusses pre-digital writing technologies: ink blotters, fountain pens, ink bottles, slates, and the transition from slate to paper in early schooling. Includes church records from St. Stephen&#x27;s (1913) and a newspaper obituary of his Great Grandmother Margaret Glendenning (age 92, 1913), who died in Canobie.</div>

	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Although
	the photo is undated, we think that it was taken about 1943-44.  It
	is likely a Ford vehicle and Della thinks that her father purchased
	the chassis and constructed some of the body – likely the interior
	but mayvbe more.</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">As
	I recall, Tom started with one bus, the one shown above,
	transporting students from Bay du Vin while the Mack and George
	Godfrey transported students from Black River.  Later Tom operated
	buses from both ends of the district.</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Tom
	was awarded a plaque for 40 years of accident free driving.   When I
	taught at the Miramichi Rural High School, and, before having a car,
	I traveled from the school back to the Branch by the school bus, on
	its return trip from the Bay du Vin run.</p>

	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">The

	papers dating back to the nineteen-forties.</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Bet
	you’d have to look quite a while to find an ink blotter in your
	house.  I found a postcard-sized <b>ink
	blotter</b> recently
	among some papers from my Teachers’ College days in 1947.  It had
	some ink spots on it but not many.  Mine was a promotional piece by
	the Bank of Montreal.</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">All
	quality <b>writing
	pads</b>, not counting
	scribblers, had an ink blotter as the first page so that, when
	finished writing a page, one simply closed the cover, the ink
	blotter, soaking up any surplus ink.</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Among
	the same papers were some notebooks from Teachers College and high
	school also written in ink as were test and exam papers.</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><b>Writing
	pens</b> of the day
	were refillable and one carried a filled pen in one’s shirt
	pocket.  It was not unusual for a leaky pen to to ruin a shirt. 
	Ink, usually black or blue, was purchased in a small bottle.</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">I
	used a <b>slate</b>
	when I started to school but all desks had a small hole in the desk
	top to hold an ink bottle and of course, in the earliest days, we
	used a <b>straight
	pen</b>.  One could
	dip the pen directly into the bottle or use the syringe, which was
	part of the bottle cap, to take a few drops of ink from the bottle
	and place it on the pen nib.  Pen nibs were of different sizes
	providing for either fine or broad strokes.</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">I
	do not remember when we shifted from slates to paper; we certainly
	had lead pencils but I cannot remember any rules on using pens
	versus pencils.
