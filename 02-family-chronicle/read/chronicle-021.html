<p><span></span><b>Petitions for Crown Land<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b><b></b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>A recent search of the internet reveals information available from the New Brunswick Provincial Archives about petitions for land from the Crown.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Preliminary information is available on line but actual photocopies are also available for $5 00 each.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I ordered a few copies and, unfortunately, found them to be difficult to read.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Not surprising, since the original petitions are upwards of 150 years old and not all writing is legible.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Some, however, were very clear.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>(One multi-name petition is signed mostly by a name and<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><span>A</span>X His Mark<span>@</span>.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The most legible writing found so far is that of my Grandfather, Walter Glendenning.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I also have other information about grants actually made.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>On comparison, the petitions and the actual awards do not always match but<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>here is what I have been able to piece together.</p>
<p><span></span><br></p>
<p><b>Jubal Watling</b> (F4243)</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>A petition for 50 acres of land <span>A</span>situate as follows: on the South side of Black River adjoining south of William McBeath<span>=</span>s meadow<span><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span> lot and east of a lot applied for by John Edge<span>@</span><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The petition is dated at Chatham on April 9, 1851 and includes his signature.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The property was vacant, surveyed but without improvements.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Other handwritten notes on the page are confusing in that they show apparent approval on May 21/51 and <span>A</span>Auction, August 51".<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They are signed by Peters, the Deputy Surveyor.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>No lot number is given.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The confusion arises from the fact that, my other sources show the William McBeath lot to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>be east of the <span>A</span>Richibucto Road<span>@</span>, Lot No. 30, consisting of 100 acres in the Meadows was granted to Jubal Watling, Junior on April 20, 1881.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This would be my Grandfather and certainly matches the location where Mum was born.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is certainly possible that the first Jubal petitioned but did not receive the land,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>that the land he petitioned was somewhere else or that the information on location was not correct.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Hopefully, we will be able to sort it out later.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>John Glendinning, Sr.</b> (F5929, F5931)</p>
<p><span></span><br></p>
<p>John Glendinning, my Great Grandfather petitioned for two lots of 100 acres each in Canobie.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>One petition shows the name as John Glendinning, Sr. and the other shows only John Glendinning but in both cases the age is given as <span>A</span>forty-seven years<span>@</span> so they are both the same person.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The petitions are faint and difficult to read.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>One petition identifies the year as 1854 and mentions the <span>A</span>west half of<span>@</span> ....<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>No lot number is given.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The lot was vacant but had been improved by applicant.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The other petition, in 1855,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>clearly identifies<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>lot #30 in Canobie which appears to have been surveyed in 1848 for Charles Scott.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The lot was vacant but improved - whether improved by John Glendinning, Charles Scott, or someone else we do not know.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Walter Glendinning</b> (F9029)</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Walter Glendinning of the Parish of New Bandon petitioned for one hundred acres situate as follows: <span>A</span>Lot No. 30, Canobie, formerly surveyed for Charles Scott. By him transferred to John Glendinning and from John Glendinning to his son Walter the present applicant.<span>@</span><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The land is said to be occupied by the applicant, Walter Glendinning, and his father and improved by applicant and his father.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A notation on the top of the petition shows 1865.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Interestingly, the top of this form is pre-printed with the word <span>A</span>AUCTION<span>@</span>. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>My other source shows a grant of Lot #30 in Canobie to Walter Glendenning on February 17, 1783.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That is quite a lag between the making of a petition and the actual grant being made.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>John Glendenning</b><b></b></p>
<p><span></span><br></p>
<p>While I did not find a petition from John Glendinning, Jr.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My reference shows a grant to John Glendenning of Lot #31 on August 17, 1868.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>The Pious Pirate</b><b></b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>San Salvador Island is part of the Bahamas.<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>On Sandy Point sits Watling Castle.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The island was originally named Watling<span>=</span>s Island in honour of Captain George Watling a famous buccaneer and pirate.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>(It was renamed in 1926).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He was also known as the <span>A</span>pious pirate<span>@</span> because he would not allow his crew to play cards or indulge in piracy on the Sabbath.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The name Watling appears frequently in literature about the Bahamas.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There may have also been a pirate named John Watling.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I am sure that neither of these were part of our family. (http://www.bahamasnet.com/sansalvador.html)</p>
<p><span></span><br></p>
<p><b>Grandfather</b><span><b>=</b></span><b>s Land Holdings</b><b></b></p>
<p><span></span><br></p>
<p>In addition to the 100 acre homestead (Lot #30) mentioned earlier in this Newsletter which he left to his son, Leonard, Grandfather Glendenning, according to his will, also owned:</p>
<p><span></span><br></p>
<p>100 acres in Canobie, which I believe to be Lot #28, which he left to his wife, Elizabeth. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>the <span>A</span>Stevens Farm<span>@</span> in Canobie containing 100 acres which he left to his wife, Elizabeth, with the proviso that it be transferred to his son Raymond if he returned to settle in Canobie.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This property is bounded on the west by the Springfield Road and is the land where Raymond later settled.</p>
<p>50 acres, the original Taylor Farm, which he left to his wife Elizabeth.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This property is immediately west of and adjoins the Stevens farm.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Apparently this land was left to or purchased by his daughter. Venetia.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Guy Glendenning said that Venetia sold the property to Matt. Ellis</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Earlier I reported that Elmer Glendenning owned lot #28 in Canobie; we also know that Uncle Chip owned property in the same area , perhaps even the same property.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If my dates are correct, one plausible scenario is that my father, Elmer, purchased the lot in 1901 and later sold it to his father, Walter.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Our grandfather, Walter, willed the property to his wife, Elizabeth, when he died in 1908.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Elizabeth died in 1915 and may have sold it or left it to her son, Chipman.who, at thata time was working in Peru.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>All of this, of course,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>is only speculation.</p>
