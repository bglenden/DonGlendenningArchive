	<p><b>Walter
	Jubal Glendenning (September 29, 1913- June 16, 1998)</b></p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>Walter
	was the second child, the first son, of Elmer and Jane (Watling)
	Glendenning.  Mother came back to New Brunswick for his birth and
	may have stayed in NB until late 1916 – we do not know for sure.

</p>
	<p> <b>Elbridge
	Watling and Walter Glendenning - Undated</b></p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>The
	family returned permanently to Little Branch in 1919 and it is
	likely that is where Walter started school.  My recollection is that
	Walter went to Grade 6, maybe Grade 7 and then worked with Dad on
	the farm.  Walter did not talk much about his early years but I know
	that he worked long and hard both summer and winter.  Because Dad
	was such a worker and Walter was the oldest boy in the family, I am
	sure that a great deal was expected of him.  
	</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>He
	had a team of dogs, Chowder and Pup, which he hitched to a sled in
	winter and traveled around the community, and cross to visit Alex
	Newton.  Once he took Dad across to George Adams’ to use the
	phone. The longest trip, Walter said, was to John W. MacNaughton’s
	– a distance of about 7 miles.  After having his tonsils removed,
	he stayed a few days with Aunt Tine in Loggieville. 
	</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>He
	would visit and stay with family in Canobie, one time traveling back
	with Uncle Frank and Uncle Chip.  Canobie cousins often came to
	visit Little Branch and once a number of them tented by the Little
	Branch School.  Walter used to play basketball at the Black River
	Hall.  I remember one summer Walter replaced bearings on the old
	Model A under an apple tree in the front yard.  Dad allowed $2.00
	per week for gas for the Model A.  If you needed more, you waited
	until the following week. 
	</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>One
	Sunday morning, Mum dressed Walter and then turned to getting the
	others ready for church.  Walter wandered out to the side of the
	barn where a number of small chicks were being kept in a half
	puncheon.  To entertain himself, Walter picked up a number of
	chickens and wrung their necks and then dropped them on the ground. 
	Perhaps he had seen Dad wring the necks of chickens before taking
	the feathers off. 
	</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>As
	a young man, everything was done by hand or with horses.  Once
	Walter and John took a load of hay to Hardwicke and returned with a
	load of smelts.  The temperature was minus 36 F with blowing and
	drifting snow.  On another occasion, Walter took a wagonload of
	two-foot furnace wood to Chatham but the lady would not accept it;
	he came back to Loggieville and sold it there for $4.50.  He also
	took furnace wood by sled under the Branch Bridge and Victoria
	Bridge, around Point Aux Carr, around Point Cheval and on to
	Loggieville.  On another occasion, Walter and Dad were bringing a
	load of wood from the Ridge (a hardwood rise at the back of the
	farm) when the wagon rack broke.  They brought the horses to the
	barn, had supper and then returned to fix the wagon by
	lantern-light.  One winter, Walter worked for the Fowlies lumbering
	the Malcolm Mac Naughton place.</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>Walter
	married Elspeth Agnes Gibson; they went to the same church and
	courted for 11 years before being married.  They were married at the
	Presbyterian Manse in Boom Road by Rev. P. McK. Sampson on November
	1, 1939 and had four children, Stephen Walter, Elizabeth Ann
	(1944-1954), Lillian and Carla.

</p>
	<p><b>Mum,
	Walter and John at the Branch</b></p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>Walter
	made a number of trips to Boston, both by train and by car, and once
	he and Brydone Weeks drove together.  (Brydone was courting Lillian)</p>
	<p>One
	Christmas, 1938 I believe, Walter was taking family members to
	Chatham in the Model A.  The right front window was broken and was
	replaced with a piece of cardboard.  Seems to me that Mum, Ken,
	Norm, Lillian and I were in the car.  As we neared the railroad
	tracks, Walter spotted a train approaching from the right.  He tried
	to stop but the car kept sliding towards the tracks.  Quick
	thinking, he tramped on the gas instead and got across just ahead of
	the train.  People on the back of Adams’ truck just ahead of us
	were sure that we were going to be hit.</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>Walter
	began building a home on the Dan MacLean place in 1937 and moved
	into it on November 1, 1940.  In the meantime, they lived at Little
	Branch.  The basement was dug with the aid of a horse, Jess, and a
	scoop and most if not all of the lumber came from Hallidays.  The
	original barn on the property burned in 1932, the same year as the
	Black River Hall.  His house was struck by lightning in 1940 but did
	not burn.</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>Although
	Walter farmed, he also worked off the farm.  In 1940 he worked at
	clearing the bombing range along the Loggieville Road.  He was
	called to the Army Service Corps during the war and was stationed at
	Ottawa, Halifax, Debert and Camp Borden.  On his return, he
	continued to farm and to work at the airport.  In 1950 he commenced
	work with Modern Construction Co. Ltd. In 1959 he moved to Moncton
	and continued to work for Modern at job sites throughout New
	Brunswick including their head office in Moncton.  He retired in
	1978.</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>Dad
	was one of the promoters of farmers working together and was
	Secretary Treasurer of the Agricultural Society #103.  Part of the
	role was to maintain a “store” from which seeds, etc. would be
	sold.  After Dad died, Walter took over the role and moved the shed
	from the Branch to his place.</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>Walter
	and Agnes always welcomed visitors – family and friends alike -
	and they were good hosts.  A meal seemed to appear effortlessly and
	Walter encouraged visitors to “eat up and give the house a good
	name.”  He liked to travel and visit family and friends in
	Bathurst, Rexton, Harvey Station and down to the Boston area.   He
	also traveled widely stopping to see men he had worked with.   For a
	while they owned a cottage in the Caissie Cape area.  
	</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>Walter
	is also remembered for his keen memory.  He seemed to remember
	anyone he ever worked with, perhaps even met, and would visit if he
	was passing nearby.  He enjoyed reminiscing but talked little about
	what himself.  
	</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>After
	moving to PEI, I dropped in on Walter and Agnes practically every
	time I passed through Moncton.  Often I arrived early and had lunch.
	 While he was interested in current events, since I was obsessed
	with genealogy, most of our conversations revolved around family
	events and members of our extended family.</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>Walter
	loved to visit the old home, “The Branch.”  A few years ago,
	when he was not able to drive, I arranged to pick him up for a day’s
	outing.  When we got into the car I said, “ We can go any where
	you would like.  Would you like to go to the Island?  Saint John?
	Fredericton? Springhill? Or where?”  He hesitated only for a
	moment then said, “I think that I’d like to go to the Branch”.
	 So we drove up, ate a sandwich at the Escuminac wharf, visited “The
	Branch” and returned to Moncton.</p>
