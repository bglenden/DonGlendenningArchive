<p><span><span class="Apple-converted-space">                                                                                                                                  </span></span></p>
<p><span></span><b>Re-union</b><b></b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>We had a great gathering on July 28 - 30; most readers were there so I will keep this item short.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Friday evening was registration and conver- sazione; Saturday morning saw people gather at the old homestead for breakfast, unveiling of a plaque, burial of a time capsule and planting of an oak tree; afternoon saw <span>A</span>highland Games<span>@</span> and barbeque at Ken and Verne<span>=</span>s cottage; evening entertainment under the big tent; Sunday included a church service with a choir full of family, an open house for extended family and friends,<b> </b>and another barbeque<b>.</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I found it especially interesting to hear some of the <span>A</span>young folks<span>@</span> reminiscing; I would like to have heard them talk when the older folk were not around.</p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>Feed-back was very positive; thanks to all for making it possible and enjoyable.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><b>Remember,</b> <b>Re-union No. 23 will be held on Saturday, July 28 2001.</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Spring</b><b></b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I forgot to look to see if the spring still flows on the side of the road down the hill from the concrete post?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Horses were taken there for water, cows were herded there once a day for water, I believe that one calf met its end there, and even passers by used it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The water ran from the spring down to the brook.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>As I recall, it had a box around it about 3 feet square; I do not recall a lid.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The box is gone but does the spring still flow?</p>
<p><b>Black sheep in the family?</b><b></b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I was looking through a book on <span>A</span>English Convicts in Colonial America<span>@</span> and found where John Watling was convicted (I do not know the crime) and sent to America aboard the <span>A</span>Thames<span>@</span><b> </b>in April, 1753.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Obviously, he would not have been one of our ancestors.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Another Branch?</b><b></b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Loisanne had a visit at her booth at the Moncton market from Bill Glendenning who has been a customer of hers for quite a while.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Seems that his father was Ken Glendenning and his Grandfather was Walter Glendenning from<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>New Mills, N.B.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He also mentioned Glendennings in Galloway, near Rexton.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Glendenning (Glenn) Steeves</b><b></b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>When Uncle Guy Glendenning visited us from Florida he usually went to Dorchester, NB to visit a WW1 buddy.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I believe the name was Steeves.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I believe, furthermore, that the friend had a son named Glendenning after Uncle Guy.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Glenn Steeves, I believe, lived/lives in Moncton.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Does any reader know the story behind the name?		</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Summer Treat?</b><b></b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Before he joined the army, Brydone drove truck for A&amp;R Loggie Company of Loggieville. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>People would phone in their grocery orders and once or twice each week Brydone would deliver groceries down river as far as Escuminac. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There were only two places he could leave groceries without being paid on the spot and one of them was at home.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p></p>
<p>Some times Brydone would take me, and I am sure others also had a turn, in the truck when he was down river delivering groceries and it included having lunch in Escuminac.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was quite a treat. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Once when we (Norman, Roy, George and I and maybe Ken?) were swimming at our shore at the mouth of the cove across from the bridge, we saw Brydone<span>=</span>s truck coming.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We watched as he approached and decided that when the truck emerged from the covered bridge, we would jump out of the water and wave.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We faced the bridge, as the truck came out of the bridge, we jumped and waved<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>dressed in our birthday suits.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was only later that we learned that day he had a woman traveling with him that day.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Old Swimming Hole</b><b></b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>As I mentioned above, we swam at our shore usually at fairly high tide.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Although we lived by the river we did not have a boat of any kind.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I can remember helping to build a raft and poling it out into the deep water and then jumping off it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>One of the things we would do is try to touch bottom when we jumped in.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There was one place, in the river behind Normans barn, where we could not touch bottom.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I am assuming that was the spot where the mud had been dug the previous winter.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>My sore toe</b><b></b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Presumably when Dad put up the concrete post, he widened the lane.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I recall the stub of a fence post sticking up a couple of inches or so in the middle of the lane.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I not only recall seeing it but also recall feeling it when I stubbed my toe.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It hurts yet when I think about it.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Queen Mother</b><span><b>=</b></span><b>s Birthday</b><b></b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The celebration of the Queen Mother<span>=</span>s birthday reminds me of the visit by the King and Queen to Newcastle in 1939.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We travelled to Newcastle in Hassie (?) Smith<span>=</span>s truck.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Or was it Harry or BW<span>=</span> truck?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As I recall, it was a sunny day and we were picked up at the Branch school about 5:30 am.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We stood in the back of the truck; I cannot recall who all was there but believe it included Ken, Norm, Roy, George, Harry MacLean, etc.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Probably 20 to 25 all together.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>We saw the King and Queen and then came home.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As I recall, Mum packed a lunch but I am not sure.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We arrived home sometime in late evening, singing all the way.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The King and Queen motored to Fredericton from Newcastle.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The story is told about the two sisters in Blackville or Boiestown who waited on the side of the road for the King and Queen to pass.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They has each bought a camera and film to ensure that at least one would get a photo.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Just before the Royal Party came along, the sisters decided that one should be on each side of the road so that, whichever way the Royal couple faced, they would have them in the photo.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The Royal couple drove past smiling and waving.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They had seen their beloved Monarch.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>They could hardly wait to have their photos developed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Imagine their surprise when they got their photos developed; they missed the<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>royal couple when they whizzed past but they had a great photo of each other.</p>
