<p><span><span class="Apple-converted-space">                                                                                                                                 </span>________________</span><span><b>Follow-up</b></span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The article on harvesting grain, No. 50, struck a responsive chord.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Thanks for you comments.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Donald Edge remembered calling sheaves “shooks” and stacking them five or six to a side.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>(From a tepee to a cabin) <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Bill Glendinning of Moncton (Roots in Galloway near Rexton, NB.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>but our relationship not yet established) working with the grain harvest while visiting his mother’s family in Bedeque, PEI.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As he says, “stoking grain was one of our worst nightmares because of the thistles in the grain sheaves.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Bill also recalls stowing hay in the barn the cream separator, milking cows, and the hayfork for unloading hay.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>These ideas I plan to deal with in a later Chronicle.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Donna Goodfellow mentioned the meals.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Had a number of comments on the article on my brother, John.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Shirley MacKay remembers him as “a big, strong and gentle man”, Tina (Watling) Newton remembers visits by John and Mary to her home in New Hampshire and visits by her parents with John and Mary in Black River.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Eddie Godfrey says that his brother, Donnie, also worked the pulp boats.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He earned $10.00 a day ($1.25 an hour); I was paid only 90 cents an hour in 1947.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My brother, Walter, got Eddie his first job at the Chatham air base.</p>

<p><b>Homestead Map - 1876</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>A homestead map by Roe &amp; Colby shows the names, but not lot numbers, of people living in Black River in 1876; In the Meadows, on the south side of the River, we find D. Macbeth, J. Watling, W. MacNaughton, D. McNaughton, D. Cameron, J. Watling, and G. Archibald.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>On the north side, across from the Meadows it shows J. Edge and W. Watling.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>On the south side of the Little Branch, we find the Branch School, J. McDonald, J. McNaughton, G. Fowley and S. McDonald.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The McKenzie road included a McKenzie -no initial, J. Anderson, R. Robinson, J. McKenzie, R. MacKenzie, Mrs. Ward and M. McDonald.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The Glendennings were latecomers to Black River and are not included. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Swish</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>Carol and I went to hear a Cape Breton group, the Cottars,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>recently and one of their songs mentioned “swish”.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I hadn’t heard that word for a long time.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Years ago, probably in the 20’s and 30’s, rum was brought from Cuba and the West Indies in wooden barrels or puncheons.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Barrels held 45 gallons; puncheons were much larger.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>(The only puncheon I ever remember was one in Uncle Jim’s barn.)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I think they were used mostly to age and ship dark, overproof rum.<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>As I understand it, the rum was cut (diluted) and bottled in <br>
Canada.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>People would buy the empty barrels and use them for storage or watering troughs on their farms.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>After getting the barrels, they would pour hot water into the barrel, and swish it around usually by turning on the barrel on its side and rolling it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The hot water would draw out rum that had soaked into the wood.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This procedure resulted in a rum drink called “swish”.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Farm Radio Forum</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>A few days ago I was looking through some old papers and came across a booklet called <span>Forum Findings.</span><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was a record of our discussions in Little Branch.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Late in or just after WW2, a national initiative was undertaken to engage people through the country in discussions about issues of the day.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The initiative was sponsored, at least in part, by the Canadian Association for Adult Education and the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The Little Branch Farm Forum operated, I believe, for several years although my notes only apply to February and March, 1949.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is likely that the forum discussions were limited to the winter period.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>A meeting on February 7 was held at the home of Mrs. F. F. Fowlie with 7 people present.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Mr. Saunders, the Agricultural Representative, was the discussion leader.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We first listened to listened to a radio broadcast on “Food in Sales Clothing” which was about sales and marketing of farm produce.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A discussion followed and then I, as Secretary, sent a report to national office in Toronto.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>On Feb 14 we met at the home of Everard MacLean with 5 people present and Uncle Jim Watling as discussion leader.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The topic was “Food Takes a Ride” – about the transportation of farm produce.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The next meeting was round-up night and after listening to the broadcast, Mr. Saunders showed a film, those present, 21 in all,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>enjoyed entertainment and a lunch.</p>
<p>On February 28 we met at the Glendenning home with Uncle Jim Watling as discussion leader.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There were 4 present and the topic was “Render Unto Caesar”. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The Little Branch Group believed that there should be “old age pensions at age 65 without a means test” and “hospitalization should be sponsored”.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Presumably the latter meant that it should be government sponsored.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The March 7 Forum was held at the home of Uncle Jim Watling.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The topic was “According to Worth” with five people present.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The topic dealt with both the price of goods to farmers and the merits of the income tax system.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The Little Branch forum recommended that future programs include more issues of interest to farm women.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Eight people were present for the session on March 14 at the home of Mrs. Ian MacNaughton.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The topic, “Many Happy Returns”, dealt with income tax returns. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Our group recommended that an Income Tax form be designed especially for farmers.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The final Forum for the winter was held at Uncle Jim Watling’s with 18 people present.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Those present included people from nearby communities who might have an interest in forming a forum in their areas.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This was a “round-up” night in that the month’s topics were reviewed. Allan Saunders, the agricultural representative, led the discussion and showed films on soil conservation.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Discussion included a meeting of the Northumberland County District Farmers Association. support for the Northumberland Co-op Creamery and the possibility of a Farm Forum in the following year.</p>
