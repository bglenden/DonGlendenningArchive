<div class="reader-summary">Don publishes an extended newspaper interview (dated 99th birthday, 1898) featuring his great-aunt Mary Ann Harley Henry, who emigrated from Ireland to the Miramichi region in 1822. Her vivid account covers living through the Napoleonic Wars, the arrival of the first steamship in Irish waters (1822), the harrowing 7-week transatlantic voyage to Pockshaw (Bay of Chaleur), and a 75-mile wilderness trek through uncut forest to Newcastle. She married John Henry and had nine children; lived 99 years (1799-1898). Don includes scholarly follow-up from cousin Kelsie Erskine exploring the family&#x27;s motivations for emigration and their Irish social standing during this period. Rich ancestral context for the Glendenning family&#x27;s Miramichi roots.</div>

<p>My Great Grandmother was Margaret Harley; her sister, Mary Ann Harley was interviewed by a newspaper in Portland, Maine on her 99<sup>th</sup> birthday.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The following is a direct quote from that article.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I thought that I had published this earlier but on checking my Chronicles, I cannot find it so I am including it here</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><i>‘I was born in Courtmasherry, Ireland, February 6, 1799.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This is a small town only a little distance from the city of Cork, near the Bay of Cork.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My maiden name was Mary Ann Harley, and my father was a schoolteacher in the town.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I had two brothers and three sisters.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>All dead now.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>One of my sisters lived to be 94, died on her birthday.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I can remember the town where we lived very well, and the names of friends and schoolmates.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I left Ireland in 1822.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I can remember about my father and mother talking about the rising of ‘98; people never seemed to get tired of taking about that event.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My father was of English descent, a Presbyterian and I was raised in the church.</i></p>
<p><i></i><br></p>
<p><i>Very well can I remember the day on which two big ships of war sailed into Cork harbor, their decks crowded with men and their masts with gay flags.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>These ships were bringing us the first news of the battle of Waterloo in which that terror of the world and ogre of history, Napoleon Bonaparte was defeated by our own Duke of Wellington.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>People went crazy with joy; the bells of the city of Cork were rung, and great bonfires were lit in celebration of the great event.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Three of the officers of an Irish regiment were quartered at my father’s house for many days, and I remember some of the stories they had to tell of that terrible fight.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Their bright uniforms and handsome faces made a great impression on me.</i></p>
<p><i></i><br></p>
<p><i>In 1822 I went to visit a lady friend in Queenstown, and while I was there the first steamboat ever to come into Irish waters came into the harbor.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Everyone turned out and lined the docks to the strange craft which moved so swiftly through the waters without sail or oars.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was a wonderful thing then, but I suppose the people of Queenstown see enough such craft now.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>While I was in Queenstown I got a letter from my brother William in America.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He was a government surveyor, and he wanted me to come over as soon as possible as he said he had a young, handsome and wealthy husband waiting for me.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I went home to my parents and it was decided that I would sail for America.</i></p>
<p><i></i><br></p>
<p><i>I was one of 150 passengers on a sailing ship which left Cork on May 7, 1822.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was a terrible voyage.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I was sick almost all the way, and glad to see land after seven weeks and three days aboard that ship.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I landed at a place called Pockshaw on the Bay of Chaleur.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was a very small settlement then, only a few small houses made of logs.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My brother was there waiting for me.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We had to walk 75 miles through the woods to get to his home.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>No roads, no conveyances of any kind, not even a path.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was a trackless forest in which not one tree had been cut.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We made our way by means of compass over windfalls and across brooks to Newcastle.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We were three nights on the road and we had to sleep in the woods without any shelter.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>On the fourth night we got to Newcastle, a very small settlement.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Eight months after my arrival at this place I married John Henry; he was a man of business and agent for a large mercantile firm.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I had nine children and seven grew up and married.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I don’t know how many descendents I have, but they must number in the hundreds.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My husband died 28 years ago (1870) I lived on the Miramichi until after my husband's death, then I came to the States where some of my children lived.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I had a brother named John Harley who built ships on Bolters Island near Newcastle.”</i></p>

<p><b>Follow up</b></p>
<p>During the past few months, I have been in touch with Kelsie Erskine, a third cousin once removed, whose Great Great Grandfather was John Harley, my Great Great Uncle and a shipbuilder on Beaubear’s Island. (See Family Chronicle No. 125)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In recent correspondence Kelsie mentioned:</p>
<p><i>I have just been reading up all about the 1798 Rebellion and was wondering how it impinged on William and Ann Harley's lives.</i></p>
<p><i>Also I know life was more prosperous in Co Cork during the Napoleonic Wars because they supplied England with beef, butter and even linen for the ships sails amongst other things then after the wars there was a slump in trade and the soldiers returning from the war had no employment and added to the general poverty. History becomes alive when you read something like that interview. (This refers to the interview printed above)</i></p>
<p><i>It was also interesting to note that the family had 3 officers of an Irish Regiment quartered at her father’s house, this shows that they had a reasonable sized house and that they had some standing in the community in that officers were with them (not ordinary soldiers). It also shows I presume that they were loyal to the Government. ie England</i></p>
<p><i>Presbyterians were not members of the established church which was the Church of Ireland and many Presbyterians were sympathetic to the United Irishmen in !798.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></i></p>
<p><i>I have often wondered why the family emigrated to Canada as it was before the Famine Years when so many left but I do think there was a rigid class structure and it would have been very hard for a schoolmaster's children to progress socially, they did not own  land nor  were they wealthy merchants so there would have been little opportunity to "make their way in the world" perhaps Canada gave them that opportunity.</i></p>
<p><i>I have been reading up on the life in early1800s in Ireland with especial reference to Co Cork and writing up a bit about it to put in with my family tree. I have other family in Cork called Warren who were big landowners so it is very interesting to study what life was like from two different perspectives!</i></p>
<p><i>It is hard to find detailed information but I hope to visit Courtmacsherry and Cork City also Warrenscourt where the Warren family lived. John Harleys granddaughter married Sir John Borlase Warrens grandson Thomas Hamilton. John Harley and Sir John Warren would not ever have met socially and marriage between the families in1880s would have been unheard of !!</i></p>
