	<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
	Some
	readers will recall that the first high school classes in the area
	were held in the Anglican Rectory in Bay du Vin and later in the Bay
	du Vin hall.  My siblings, Norm, Ken and Elinor actually walked the
	five miles each way each day, biked or traveled by horse and sled
	although Elinor, who was the first to go to school in Bay du Vin,
	stayed during the winter months at Goymer Williston’s.  I
	mentioned in an earlier newsletter.  
	</p>
	<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">

	</p>
	<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
	The
	first school transportation, Ken remembers was a “big” truck,
	2-3 ton with a box on the back, operated by Goymer Williston; it
	picked up students from Black River, and presumably from the other
	districts as well, and transported them to Bay du Vin.

	<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
	By
	the fall of 1940 classes had moved 
	</p>
	<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
	to
	the new Miramichi Rural High School, the first of some fifty rural
	high schools built throughout New Brunswick.  Eddie Godfrey believes
	that the Godfreys began operating a school bus, pictured on the
	left, in the fall of 1940: thanks to Eddie also for the following
	information.</p>

	</p>
	<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
	The
	bus shown on the left was built on a one and one-half ton Fargo
	chassis purchased, he believes, from the W.S.Loggie Co.  Their
	second bus, purchased in 1944 at St. John, NB was khaki colour (a
	wartime colour); the third bus was a 21/2 ton Fargo, blue and white,
	built in Levis, PQ; their final bus was a 1947  International built
	in Saint John.  The Godfrey Bros. ended their business in 1955 and
	the remaining buses were sold.</p>

	</p>
	<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
	When
	the Godfrey Bros. purchased their second bus, the one pictured above
	was sold to Gordon Dick of Upper Napan and used to transport
	students from Napan and Point aux Carr to school in Chatham.  Those
	communities were not part of the MRHS school district.</p>

	As
	I recall one year, 1941, I received seven books: I did not do many
	chores during that Christmas break and actually recall comments
	about “having my head stuck in a book.”  Just for the fun of it,
	I reread these books in recent days.</p>

	A

	shows actual photos of the Armada off Shediac in 1933.   Shediac was
	a refueling stop for aircraft, flying boats, between Europe and
	North America; other stops included Holland, Iceland, and Labrador. 
	On July 13, 1933, 24 Sovoja Marchetti S55 flying boats landed in
	Shediac Bay under the command of General Balboa.  The Armada was on
	the way to Chicago to attend the Century of Progress Exposition. 
	The following day, Italian Armada Day, Shediac was a bedecked city,
	with a giant parade and even traffic jams.</p>

	I
	was talking with someone recently about pouring cement and he
	recalled, and I remember, that cement for basements walls and floors
	was mixed by hand and moved by wheel barrow.  Furthermore, field
	stone was often buried in the cement in order to strengthen the wall
	or floor.  Cement would not adhere to a dry stone so each stone was
	dipped in water before being put into the cement.  One also had to
	be sure that the stone was in the centre of the wall and not
	touching the concrete form.  The quality and strength of cement
	today no longer requires this to be done.</p>
