<p>	<b>The Family</b> <b>Chronicle</b><b></b></p>
<p>No. 194									October 10, 2010 <span>___________________________________________________________________</span></p>
<p><span></span><span> </span><b>Neighbours/People/Characters:</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>There always seemed to be something going on at our house.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This was partly because we were a large family and active in the community, but also because my father, as Secretary Treasurer of Agricultural Society #103, operated the “store” for its members.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>People from Black River and neighbouring communities came to our place to pick up farm supplies.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The following names have stayed in my memory:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Uncle Bob and Aunt Bioney MacDougall – although called Uncle<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>and Aunt, were not actually related. Their original home, I believe, was on the Point beyond Harper’s, or in the very long lane across from, and just below, Jim Cameron’s.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Later they moved to Hexham corner and kept the Post Office<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Charlie Blizzard – lived in Loggieville but later moved to the Bush Smith house across from the Miramichi Rural High School. He was a well known character, with a yard cluttered with machinery and a long beard. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Fred MacLean<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>known for his<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>dry wit;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Will Harris, from Glenwood, was a butcher and peddled meat around Black River from the back of his truck – a green International ½ ton as I recall</p>
<p>Jack Gibson – was a tall and big-boned, ruddy faced man.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>For years he delivered mail around Black River.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In winter he used a sled on which he built a light frame which was covered with unbleached cotton, with an “ising glass” window, to protect him from the cold.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A slot in the front allowed the reins to pass through. Jack was caretaker at the Black River Hall and would close the hall at the end of a dance.</p>
<p>Wallace MacDonald was quickly aggravated when people, especially young people, teased him. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Among the stories are ones of him banging on the Little Branch school door, trying to get into the school toilet where the boys were hiding, fending off Halloween visitors, and walking to Chatham carrying the tailgate of his sled to report a misdeed by pranksters.</p>
<p>George Adams, Sr - operated a convenience store. He carried groceries, packaged meat, kerosene, gasoline, lantern and lamp chimneys, candy, etc...<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He had an icehouse where he buried ice in sawdust to keep perishables in the summer...</p>
<p>Mr. Harper – came out from Scotland; I am not sure that he had any special training but was called in when animals were sick.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Because he did not have a telephone or transportation, Norman often ended up taking him on his calls.</p>
<p><span>FA Fowlie – was a Liberal member of the </span>35th New Brunswick Legislative Assembly in the early 1920’s.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He seemed to have a supervisory role in repairing local roads and bridges.</p>
<p>Fred Williston had a stutter resulting, I was told, from having experienced the Halifax Explosion.</p>
<p>Miss Fish – was an insurance agent for the Imperial Life Insurance Company.</p>
<p>Abe Napke – was a peddler who drove around the community with his horse and wagon selling small household items from a gray box with doors was built on the back of the wagon.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I am not sure where he lived or stayed while in the community</p>
<p>Jim Finno had a large early transparent apple tree; young people often raided his orchard.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Jim was blind but was thought to have a shotgun although I cannot ever remember anyone saying he fired it.</p>
<p>Long Earl Macdonald was said to be a bootlegger. and had liquor available at dances.</p>
<p>Howard Dutcher from Bay du Vin needed crutches to get around yet he was able to farm. I remember him coming to the store driving a farm wagon</p>
<p>Hazen Williston, although not formally trained, was known for his ability to diagnose and fix engines</p>
<p>Goymer Williston had the largest truck in the community at the time – a three ton with a box with high sides.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Before the Godfrey’s had a bus, Goymer transported students to classes in the Bay du Vin church. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Sterling Williston drove one of Clay Williston’s trucks to take us to see the King and Queen in Newcastle during their 1939 visit.</p>
<p>Roy Williston, it seemed, bought a new car every year and kept it spotless.</p>
<p>Bonnie Flanagan lived beyond St. Margaret’s but traveled around our area purchasing beef cattle,</p>
<p>Mack and George Godfrey owned and operated the first school buses. and later provided regular service to Chatham</p>
<p>Tommy Adams had the school bus contract but also ran the store after his father died.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He sold Massey Harris farm equipment.</p>
<p>Alex Macdonald “managed” a crew who dredged harbours and rivers.</p>
<p>Tom MacLean made and repaired sleds</p>
<p>Sinclair Williston operated a blacksmith shop and also shod horses.</p>
<p>Little Sandy MacNaughton saved Kerr Loggie’s life during WW!: when WS Loggie's operated a Chrysler dealership, they gave Sandy a new car from time to time.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I am not sure if he actually gave him a car or simply gave him a good deal on a car.</p>
<p>The first new truck on the road after WW2, a fire engine red half-ton, was owned by Arnie Watling who delivered mail from Chatham to various post offices on the south side of the Miramichi</p>
<p>Ian MacNaughton was a Justice of the Peace (JP) which allowed him some legal authority when documents had to be signed.</p>
<p>J.D. and Isabel MacRae had a family of seven daughters – no sons.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Willie Dunn carried the mail, it seemed for years.</p>
<p>Richard Gill bought logs and pulp; I believe that he also had crews in the woods up the Branch for several winters.</p>
<p>John Fowlie was the local fire warden.</p>
<p>Mel Adams opened<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>a dance hall in Bayside after the war</p>
<p>Tom Coll, an Englishman, appeared in Black River about the beginning of the war, lived in the Ken MacDonald house, and left after the war.</p>
<p>Big Donald MacDonald, it was said, walked out to the road first thing each morning to if there were any new tracks on the road.</p>
<p>Jack McMaster, who lived across from Wright Gregan in Hardwicke, would buy apples in Nova Scotia each fall and peddle them around Black River.</p>
<p>Ramsay MacLean, Upper Black River, built a home in anticipation of getting married.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Marriage plans fell through; the house is still standing but has never been lived in.</p>
<p>Frank MacDougall, I believe, was a well driller</p>
<p>Peter Whitty traveled around the community; he may have worked for and stayed at Allie MacDougall’s but am not sure.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Although there are others, I decided to limit my list to names I could include in one Chronicle.</p>
