<b>Follow
	-up</b></p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">You
	may remember that, some time ago, I mentioned asking permission in
	school to go to the toilet and using one or two fingers to indicate
	more precisely the nature of nature’s call.  Regis Carroll sent a
	follow-up note to the effect that if paper was required it was given
	to the student as he or she left the building.  (Young readers may
	not realize that there was no indoor plumbing in our schools in
	those days).  Paper was not left in the toilet presumably because it
	would get soaked by rain or snow, might blow away or otherwise just
	disappears.</p>
