	<p align="center"><img src="img/chronicle-113/img001.jpg" align="bottom" />
</p>
	<p align="center"><b>Ken in
	front yard</b></p>
	<p align="justify">Ken
	was born on July 25, 1924 and attended the Little Branch School to
	the end of Grade 8.  One year he stayed with Venetia and Cam in
	Point Aux Carr, went to school, and did the chores while Cam fished
	smelts.  He also attended classes in the Bay du Vin Hall and
	graduated from MRHS</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">In
	October 1939, Ken and I both came down with scarlet fever a week
	apart.  I remember the date because Walter and Agnes came to the
	house and looked in on us the day they were married – November 1,
	1939.  I think the quarantine period was 6 weeks - a red warning
	sign was posted by the front door. We shared the bedroom on the
	ground floor.  Then Ken came down with complications and I was moved
	to the small bedroom upstairs.  That was the time that “Old Jess”,
	our faithful old horse, was put down.</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">We
	always tapped a few maple trees and Mum made maple syrup.  I went
	with Ken with a horse and sled, with cream cans and the barrel from
	the churn, to collect sap.  As I recall, it was early in the morning
	before we went to school.</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">Ken
	has stories to tell about Venetia catching him when he tumbled out
	of the car on a turn in the Bathurst Road, getting pecked near an
	eye by a hen, and Wallace MacDonald’s visit to the Little Branch
	school. .  Once on a visit to Bathurst, Ken and I stayed with Aunt
	Maude 
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">In
	1943, Ken enlisted in the RCAF; he phoned Mum from Moncton and, as I
	recall, Walter, Mum and I saw him at the Newcastle station when the
	train stopped briefly.  His first posting was to Toronto fro basic
	training then to Galt fro technical training; later postings
	included St. John’s, Quebec and Scoudouc, New Brunswick.  He
	brought an airman from BC home for Christmas that first Christmas.</p>
	<p align="center"><img src="img/chronicle-113/img003.jpg" align="bottom" />
</p>
	<h2>Ken at Venetia’s home</h2>
	<p align="justify">In
	1946 he married Verne Taylor and they had two children, Keith and
	Doreen.  Ken and I both boarded at the home of Bentley Lewis in
	Moncton when Ken was taking a carpentry course and I went to summer
	school in 1948.  In 1950 he re-enlisted in the RCAF and postings
	included Trenton, Calgary, Armstrong, Resolute, Moncton, Greenwood,
	Ottawa and Chatham.</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">Ken
	was a carpenter by trade building homes on Saturdays and evenings
	wherever he was posted; he built his own home in Napan, Venetia’s
	home after her fire and a home for his in-laws after their fire.  He
	pitched in to help others building homes, barns, sheds, etc.</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>Ken and Verne are active members of St. Paul’s
	Presbyterian Church and Ken has been Clerk of Session for 27 years.
	For years he picked up Venetia and Edith Bremner every Sunday for
	church and still takes Edith on a regular basis.  He and Verne are
	active in the senior’s organization and are ardent supporters of
	church suppers in the Miramichi.</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p>Ken has a great memory and likes to recount jokes
	and stories of yesteryear.  I often check with him on items for this
	newsletter.  He attends in local political meetings.  At age 80 he
	purchased a computer and has learned the intricacies of email, games
	and the internet.  Ken and Verne are regular participants in the
	Seniors' card games at the Black River Hall and impromptu games
	either at their home or the home of friends.</p>
	<p align="center"><img src="img/chronicle-113/img002.jpg" align="bottom" />
</p>
	<h2>Ken and Verne</h2>
	<p align="justify">Ken
	and Verne provide me with a home when I visit the Miramichi.</p>
