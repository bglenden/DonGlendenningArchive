	During
	the period 1940-46, all adults over 16 in Canada, except for people
	in the military, members of religious orders and people in
	institutions, had to register.  Registration was under the War
	Measures Act and was to permit the mobilization of all the human and
	material resources of the nation for the purpose of the defense and
	security of Canada.

	<p style="widows: 2; orphans: 2; margin-top: 0.07in; margin-bottom: 0.07in; line-height: 100%; background: #ffffff">

	employment status, farming or mechanical skills; and previous
	military service.

	“<i>I
	especially enjoyed the memories of early automobiles, and the
	mention of gravity-fed gas tanks reminded me that early cars low on
	fuel sometimes had to go uphill in reverse to keep the fuel flowing.
	One item not mentioned was the tire repair kit, with the perforated
	lid used to rough up the inner tube area to be patched, and the tube
	of patching glue with its very powerful odor that I can still
	remember.&nbsp; Wonder we weren't addled by that stuff,&nbsp;since
	tires had to be repaired frequently.”</i></p>

	Recently
	I read a small book (120 pp)  on the arrival of the United Empire
	Loyalists in New Brunswick (Hope Restored by Robert Dallison).  It
	was of interest because many Black River residents have Loyalist
	roots.</p>

	In

	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">The
	Wartime Price and Trade Board introduced food rationing in Canada in
	1942 and issued ration books; I have Ration Book 2 and 3 that I
	picked up at a yard sale.  While many things were in short supply,
	the purchase of tea, coffee, sugar, butter and gasoline required
	coupons.  My books have coupons for meat and butter, and additional
	pages that are coded but not named.  Molasses was covered by the
	sugar coupon.</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">People
	staying in hotels, camps, hospitals, etc. for a week or longer had
	to turn over their ration books during their stay so that the
	appropriate stamps could be removed.  Although I believe truckers
	required stamps for gasoline, the same did not apply to farmers.</p>

	We
	also saved newspapers, lead from packages of loose tea, scrap metal,
	rags and clothing.  Paper and cardboard could be used for cartons,
	shell wads and shell cases; metal was reused in the production of
	war materials and bones were used to make glue for airplanes.</p>
	<p style="margin-top: 0.07in; margin-bottom: 0.07in; orphans: 2; widows: 2; line-height: 100%; background: #ffffff">
	I

	pots and pans and other scrap awaiting pickup.</p>
