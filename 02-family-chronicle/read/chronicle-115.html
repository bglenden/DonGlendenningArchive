	“<i>Our
	telephone hung in a box on the wall, and by cranking a handle on one
	side of the box you made a continuous ring in every house in Black
	River. To differentiate homes, our phone was 22--two long and two
	short cranks of the handle. Little Annie MacNaughton was the local
	telephone operator, and of course she got to hear everything, as
	could anyone else who picked up the phone whenever it rang anyone's
	number.  There was a benefit to this, because a continuous cranking
	caused a continuous ringing in all the homes in the area, alerting
	families to a disaster such as a barn on fire, a forest fire, a
	sudden death.</i></p>

	<i>Today
	the phones there are modern and private.  The old MacNaughton house
	now has a street and a number (1008 North Black River Road) and a
	ZIP code (E1N 5T3) and a FAX number, and it has an Internet address
	with photographs.  The telephone number is no longer 22; now it is
	01 46 06 14 74.  Try hand cranking that!”</i></p>

	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Braking
	systems have certainly changed for the better over the years. 
	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
	Our
	Model A had mechanical brakes which means that a metal rod linked
	the brake pedal with the brake shoes on each wheel.  Brake shoes
	moved out against the inside of the brake drum when the brakes were
	applied.  Adjustments were possible through a turnbuckle, however,
	it was difficult to have or keep the setting just right with the
	result that it was not unusual for one wheel to have more pressure
	than another.  As a result, cars often swerved if brake pedals were
	jammed hard.  Replacement brake shoes were usually replaced at home.
	
	</p>
	<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
	<br />

	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Our
	1939 Ford truck had hydraulic brakes which allowed the pressure to
	be applied evenly to all four brake shoes making smoother stops and
	fewer skids.  It seemed that they were in constant need of repair. 
	Again, often done at home.  Most often the problem was with leaking
	wheel and master cylinders.  Many a time, I recall my older brothers
	remove the brake drums to clean or replace rubbers in the cylinders.
	 Sometimes it was a grain of sand while other times it was worn
	parts.  I assume that the quality of the rubber during the war years
	was also a problem.  And each time the brakes were worked on, the
	brake lines had to be bled to remove the air from the lines.  Air in
	the lines meant a soft brake pedal and less pressure when braking. 
	While much of the repair was done at home, I also recall frequent
	visits to Nevin’s Garage which was just up and on the opposite
	side of the street from Calvin Presbyterian church.  Driving with
	little or no brake pressure could be a bit tricky.</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Since
	then, cars come equipped with disk brakes which, among other things,
	are self adjusting for normal wear and current vehicles have an ABS
	(Automatic Braking System) which means that brake pressure is
	adjusted on each wheel electronically to ensure smooth braking.</p>
