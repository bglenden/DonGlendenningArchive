	<p>No. 31 Elementary Flying
	Training School (EFTS) at Chatham used the Fleet Finch for training 
	purposes during World War Two.  The above photo of a Fleet Finch was
	taken recently at the air museum in Ottawa.  As I understand it,
	after some basic flight training given elsewhere, pilots then came
	to the Chatham air base because it was designated a low flying area.
	 In fact, a number of planes were forced to land or crashed while on
	training missions.   As I recall, there was only one life lost in a
	plane crash in the Black River area and that was in the crash at Alf
	MacLean’s shore..</p>

	<b>A counting rhyme:</b></p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>Jennie Foley (we are both descended from John
	Peters and Jane (Sealey) Peters) reminded me of the following rhyme
	usually triggered when spotting one or more crows:&nbsp;</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p><i><b>One
	crow sorrow, 	Two crows joy</b></i></p>
	<p><i><b>Three
	crows a wedding,    Four crows a boy</b></i></p>
	<p><i><b>Five
	crows silver, 	Six crows gold</b></i></p>
	<p><i><b>Seven
	crows a secret, Never to be told.</b></i></p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>It is
	amazing how quickly nursery rhymes drop from view.  I was at a
	family gathering recently and none of the younger generation had
	ever heard this rhyme.</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p><b>Lodges</b></p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>While
	looking through papers recently, I came across a certificate from
	Hadattah Lodge No. 117, Independent Order of Odd Fellows which reads
	s follows:</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p><i><b>Portland,
	Me. , Oct 21</b></i><sup><i><b>st</b></i></sup><i><b>,
	1901</b></i></p>
	<p><i><b>This
	Certifies that Bro. Elmer A. Glendenning</b></i></p>
	<p><i><b>Was
	this evening admitted to membership in this lodge.</b></i></p>
	<p><i><b>John
	Steward  N.G</b></i></p>
	<p><i><b>Henry
	G. Milliken Sec’y</b></i></p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>In a
	Masonic Text Book, in Dad’s handwriting, is the following
	inscription:</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p><i><b>I
	was made a Master Mason the last Saturday night in 1911 at Ocoee
	Lodge No. 212, Benton, Tennessee, E.A.Glendenning</b></i></p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>And in
	another Masonic Book in Dad’s handwriting:</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p><i><b>Presented
	to E. A. Glendenning</b></i></p>
	<p><i><b>By
	James Cortey of</b></i></p>
	<p><i><b>Knoxville,
	Tennessee</b></i></p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>Dad and
	Mum set up housekeeping in Parksville, Tennessee on April 11, 1911
	and their first child, Grace was born there. Dad worked on the
	construction of Ocoee No. 1, a dam at Parksville.  Later they moved
	a few miles up river where a second dam, Ocoee #2,  was built.  Mum
	returned to NB for Walter’s birth in 1913.  Dad may or may not
	have accompanied her but they were both in NB in 1914.</p>

	Stephen’s Church, Black River</b></p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>The
	Commercial of February 26 , 1924 carried the following:</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p><i><b>That
	little white church on the Island, </b></i>
	</p>
	<p><i><b>Surrounded
	by beauties supreme, </b></i>
	</p>
	<p><i><b>Over
	and over provides inspiration;</b></i></p>
	<p><i><b>So
	one need not go begging a theme.</b></i></p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p><i><b>When
	the dew it lies damp on the clover,</b></i></p>
	<p><i><b>And
	the birds in the branches sing high,</b></i></p>
	<p><i><b>And
	the sheen on the flowing Black River,</b></i></p>
	<p><i><b>Reflects
	the rare gliut (glint?) of the sky.</b></i></p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p><i><b>In
	the quiet still hours of the morning,</b></i></p>
	<p><i><b>As
	nature, her gay garb doth assume,</b></i></p>
	<p><i><b>And
	our thoughts dwell on the Creator;</b></i></p>
	<p><i><b>And
	our hearts are with Him in tune.</b></i></p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p><i><b>Our
	lives have been filled with his mercies,</b></i></p>
	<p><i><b>Our
	spirits partake of His grace,</b></i></p>
	<p><i><b>Just
	here we pause, and adore him</b></i></p>
	<p><i><b>For
	providing so hallowed a place.</b></i></p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p><i><b>A
	place that is crammed with rich memories</b></i></p>
	<p><i><b>That
	in our hearts must forever burn bright,</b></i></p>
	<p><i><b>As
	we wander through the “God’s Acre”,</b></i></p>
	<p><i><b>And
	think of those now, gone from sight</b></i></p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p><i><b>They
	have passed through the grave’s dark portal</b></i></p>
	<p><i><b>To a
	land supernal and blest,</b></i></p>
	<p><i><b>And
	we know with a perfect assurance</b></i></p>
	<p><i><b>Again
	we’ll meet; when we enter our rest.</b></i></p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p><i><b>We
	love thee, white church on the Island,</b></i></p>
	<p><i><b>With
	your tower pointing clear to the sky;</b></i></p>
	<p><i><b>In
	language, though low, still convincing,</b></i></p>
	<p><i><b>That
	our home is not here, but on high.</b></i></p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p><i><b>We
	wish thee  well, little white church on the Island</b></i></p>
	<p><i><b>Our

	<p><i><b>And

	milking and the separator.&nbsp; I never did get the hang of
	milking, but I enjoyed Eliot Cail's accuracy when he shot a stream
	straight into the mouth of one of the barn cats.&nbsp; ]There's a
	whole other article--the house tabby versus the semi-wild barn
	ratters/mousers.]&nbsp; I especially liked your very clear
	description of the seperator, since I never understood how the thing
	worked.&nbsp; I do remember that cleaning the parts was so critical
	that the task was never&nbsp;assigned &nbsp;to males of any age. I
	look foward (I hope) to an article on the butter churn.&nbsp; Ours
	was a barrel-type operated by both hand and foot, and in my mind I
	still feel the thump-da-thump that let us know the cream was now
	butter.</p>
