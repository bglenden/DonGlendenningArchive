</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">In
	1956 I visited James Glendenning in Annan, Scotland, the place from
	which our Great Grandfather sailed.  In fact, I stayed a couple of
	nights with two of his maiden aunts.  James operated a men’s
	clothing store; he has since died and the store is operated by his
	son, Walter.</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

	</p>
	<h1>Australia</h1>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Recently
	I read a book, <u>The
	Fatal Shore</u>, by
	Robert Hughes, about the history of Australia. In it, he quotes
	Thomas Watling, from Dumfries, Scotland, who was transported to
	Scotland for forging notes on the Bank of Scotland; Watling was a
	landscape painter who arrived in Australia in 1792.   Watling is
	quoted a number of times on the barrenness of the country and the
	conditions in which people lived.  An internet source speaks of  the
	“Watling Collection” of several hundred oil paintings in the
	British Museum in London.  James Watling was born in Dumfries,
	Scotland in 1762, the son of Ham Watlin.</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

	</p>
	<h2>Name</h2>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">In
	a legal document dated November 13, 1901, Uncle Jim’s full name
	was given as James Alexander William Watling.</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

	</p>
	<h2>Meadows to Little Branch</h2>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Our
	Grandfather, Jubal Watling, lived at the Meadows; he married Grace
	MacDonald who lived at Little Branch – where Neil Watling now
	lives.  Grandmother’s father, John, died in 1900, I think, and her
	mother, Elspeth, was not well.  In addition, James, Grandmother’s
	brother had inherited the farm when his father died, was not
	married, was living at home but was not able to operate the farm. 
	As best I can interpret, the land did not include the Jessie
	McDonald property where Norman Glendenning now lives.</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">On
	November 13, 1901, James entered into an agreement with his sister,
	Grace and her husband, Jubal.  As parties to the agreement also were
	Jubal and Grace’s four sons, George, John, James and Ernest.  A
	copy of this agreement can be found in the Northumberland County
	Registrar’s office.  
	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">All
	the land and buildings are to be turned over to the Watlings.  In
	return, the Watlings will “keep support, maintain and provide the
	said James J. McDonald and his mother, Mrs. John D. McDonald, each
	of them and the survivor of them during the respective terms of
	their natural lives with good and sufficient house, room, meat,
	drink, washing, clothing, bedding, fire, light, medicine, medical
	attendance, personal expenses and all such necessaries as persons of
	their ages and conditions in life usually require and are accustomed
	to.”  The Watlings were also to provide a “decent Christian
	burial” paying all funeral expenses.</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Elspeth
	(Jardine) MacDonald died September 12, 1907 and James died April 1,
	1923.</p>
	<h2></h2>
	<h2>Anti-I-Over?</h2>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Donald
	Edge was trying to recall the name of a game played by youngsters in
	Black River.  It was, I believe, Anti-I-Over although I am not sure
	of the correct spelling.</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">It
	was played between two teams separated by a building – usually the
	house, the barn or a large shed.  One team would throw the ball over
	the building – anywhere along the roof.  The other team would wait
	for the ball to appear and would try to catch it.  If not
	successful, they threw the ball back over.  If successful in
	catching the ball, team members would run around the building and
	attempt to catch (hit the other team with the ball.  If they did,
	they won.</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">This
	is my recollection of the rules of the game but I would welcome
	comments.</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><b>Bob
	MacLean Property</b></p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">It
	appears that the Bob MacLean property was part of an original grant,
	Lot #6, to John MacLeod.  On August 30, 1931, Bob mortgaged the
	property to Peter and Bessie Moody.  A sister? Aunt?  On August 27,
	1931 he paid off the mortgage.</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">On
	the same day, Bob transferred the property to Elmer Glendenning. 
	Part of the deal was that Bob could continue to live on the
	property, to harvest the crop of oats then ripening and to remove a
	barbed wire fence around the oat field.  Provision is also made for
	a right of way to the Dan MacLean property, where Walter lived prior
	to moving to Moncton.</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">The
	Bob MacLean property passed, on Dad’s death, to Mum and from Mum
	to John on September 22, 1947</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

	</p>
	<h2>The Meadows</h2>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">There
	is some confusion in my mind about the Watling grants at the
	Meadows.  On April 9, 1851, Jubal Watling petitioned for a lot on
	the south side of Black River.  A note on the side of the petition
	appears to show that it was approved on May 21, 1851.  A later not
	shows “Auction” dated August, 1851</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Other
	information suggests that Jubal Watling was granted 100 acres, Lot
	#30 in 1881.  This matter requires some more investigation.</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><b>Queen
	Mother</b></p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">The
	death of the Queen Mother brought to mind the visit of the King and
	Queen to Newcastle in 1938. The King and Queen came by train to
	Newcastle then went by car to Fredericton.</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">A
	number of us from the Little Branch, maybe 15 or so?, went to
	Newcastle in the back of a big (3 ton) open truck.  It seems to me
	that the truck belonged Harry or “Hassie” Smith.  We were picked
	up very early in the morning and returned home fairly late in the
	evening although not after dark.  I think that we stood all the way;
	there were no benches to sit on.  It was a beautiful sunny day; I am
	not sure what we would have done had it rained.</p>
