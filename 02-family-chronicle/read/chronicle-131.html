  Issue 131 &middot; Feb 10, 2006
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Three thematic sections. First: Argyle Shore (PEI) annual farm tractor show featuring 100+ working machines (no pre-WWII vintage). Second: lyrical personal essay on transparent apples—semi-ripe pale green fruit from lone orchard tree (MacNaughton property), crispness and tartness superior to fully ripe white specimens, bounty exceeded Don&#x27;s consumption, fallen fruit worthless. Plea to readers to locate similar trees (will travel by July for taste). Third: historical note on &quot;turnpiking&quot; (grandfather Glendenning turnpiked Canobie-Springfield road); internet sources conflate toll-collecting with road-making. Wages and costs in 1915 (Fighting 26th Battalion, CEF): Warrant Officer $2.50/day, Sergeant $1.50, Corporal $1.20, Private $1.10; soldiers could assign 80% pay to relatives; bread 5¢/lb, beef 13¢/lb, mutton 15¢/lb; no income tax. Funeral customs history: home wakes, two-day visitations (now reduced), neighbor assistance, purple banner at door, winter transport by sled, brief eulogies (sermons dominant), hand-dug graves, sandy Black River Cemetery soil facilitated winter burial. Rich social history and personal memoir.</div>

	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Folks
	along the Argyle shore in PEI  put on an annual farm tractor show; I
	went this year for the first time.  There were over 100 working farm
	tractors on display. The above shows a row of Cockshutt tractors but
	there were many other makes as well.  None of the tractors were
	pre-WW2 vintage.</p>

	</p>
	<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
	An almost ripe transparent
	apple is the best thing I have ever eaten.  Almost ripe transparents
	were a pale green; fully ripe in August they were almost white, but
	by then they had lost some of the tart crispness I so much enjoyed.
	I did my best to keep any transparent apple from ripening, but the
	bounty of that lone tree in the small MacNaughton orchard beside the
	house was truly amazing, and there were always a great many green
	apples that escaped me and grew to maturity. Once they had fallen
	from the tree they were of no interest to me--they were too white,
	too mushy.</p>
	<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
	<br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
	There were other apple trees,
	but only the one transparent. It was an old tree when I first knew
	it, and over the years I saw it produce less and less, and then it
	was gone.  I have never seen another one, although I have looked. If
	any reader knows of one, I beg you to contact me immediately,
	preferably by July.  I will go wherever I must go to eat of the
	fruit of that tree.  One bite and I will be in Eden, in the paradise
	as I remember it, of summer boyhood down home.</p>

	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">The
	term “turnpike” is used to denote the making of a new road.  In 
	fact, I read that my Grandfather Glendenning had “turnpiked” the
	road from Canobie to a new settlement about a mile in behind Canobie
	called Springfield.

	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">My
	search on the internet, however, speaks of “turnpiking” as
	collecting a toll.  There were a number of references about a person
	being given permission by the local or state authorities to collect
	tolls.   Certainly the Maine Turnpike was a toll road.</p>

	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Funeral
	customs have changed and are changing.  When I was young, people
	were waked and buried from their home; sometimes a service was held
	in the church just prior to the burial.  Cremation was unheard of in
	the community</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"> 
	There
	were always two days for visitation whereas now one day is becoming
	the norm.  .</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">In
	times of bereavement, neighbours brought food, cooked and did the
	dishes.  Visits were more than a brief handshake in a receiving
	line.  After the mourners left the house for the cemetery, a
	neighbour usually stayed behind to rearrange the room before the
	family returned.  A deep purple ribbon or banner was place by the
	front door of the deceased’s home.  
	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">In
	the winter, bodies would be transported from the house to the 
	cemetery by a sled and a wagon during the summer</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Eulogies,
	if any, were brief; the funeral was an occasion for the minister to
	deliver a sermon.  I remember my Aunt saying that a funeral provided
	an opportunity to reach many people who were not church-goers.</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">The
	actual burial took place whatever the time of the year.  The dry,
	sandy soil of the Black  River Cemetery meant that the ground was
	relatively easy to dig even in the midst of winter.  Graves were dug
	by hand and usually by relatives and neighbours.</p>
