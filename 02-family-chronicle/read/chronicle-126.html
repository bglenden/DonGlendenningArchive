<div class="reader-summary">Historical photograph of 1909 St. Stephen&#x27;s Presbyterian Choir (25 individuals identified, including Watling and MacNaughton family members; photographer Ernest MacLean). Extensive personal essay by Donald Edge (&quot;Faith of our Fathers&quot;) describing childhood religious experience: mandatory Sunday attendance (aisle 14), hymn singing (&quot;Onward Christian Soldiers,&quot; &quot;Old Rugged Cross&quot;), summer Sunday school, Bible verse memorization, hand pump organ music. Details cultural significance of shoes (worn only weekends/church), cemetery visits overlooking Black River with familiar gravesites and erosion concerns. Addresses church schism (&quot;governance problem&quot;) and Protestant denominational diversity. Concludes with poignant retrospective: &quot;postcard winters and endless golden summers&quot; and &quot;people I loved then as I love them now.&quot; Deep community and family religious history; demonstrates Don&#x27;s editorial role curating contributor memories.</div>

	<i>MacNaughtons were United
	Churchers, and we were expected to go every Sunday and sit in aisle
	14 or nearby.  We sang a lot of hymns, and I still like belting out
	&quot;Onward, Christian Soldiers,&quot; &quot;The Old Rugged Cross&quot;
	and &quot;Come to the Church in the Wildwood.&quot;  In summers I
	went to Sunday school where I learned to plait bracelets and
	memorized Bible verses.  Cousin Sidney and I wore white shirts and
	neckties and stood in front of everyone one Sunday and answered
	Bible questions and recited verses.  We were pretty good at verses,
	although our behavior was not always good.  Especially Sidney.  </i>

	<i>Going to church in summer
	meant wearing shoes.  This wasn't as simple as it sounds, especially
	when you have gone barefoot all week, and then wore shoes Saturday
	night to walk up one side of Main Street in Chatham, in and out of
	Loggie's and then down the other side of the street to start over
	again.  We were pretty sick of those shoes when we got home late
	Saturday night, and there we were on the following morning, in shoes
	once more. Apart from my favorite hymns and the communion grape
	juice, I wasn't all that keen on church, and while I liked watching
	whatshisname pump the handle that provided air for the organ, I
	never really understood what the minister was talking about.</i></p>

	<i>I also liked visiting the
	graves after church.  The St. Stephen's cemetery is on a promontory
	overlooking Black River as it widens on its path to the Miramichi,
	and my father is buried close to the overlook, and now my mother is
	beside him.  The cemetery was interesting because so many names were
	familiar, and because of the variety of gravesites--flat stones,
	headstones, head-and-foot stones, monuments, tables to shelter those
	interred, and intricate metal fences. For some time the promontory
	was threatened by erosion, and there was talk of graves opening and
	caskets revealed--great stuff for boys.</i></p>

	<i>One of my best friends was
	Marvin MacLean, and he and lots of otherwise really good people went
	to the other church, quite close to St. Stephen's.  As I understand
	matters, in the not too distant past there had been some problem
	with governance, meaning who is in charge, and so the church split
	in two so that whoever wanted to be in charge got to do so.  This
	seems to be standard Protestant fare and explains the many versions
	of Protestantism.  In any event, I felt comfortable going to&nbsp;what
	I thought was the real church.</i></p>

	<i>How I came to be in

	were human and so less than ideal, and the events were real and so
	less than perfect.  But when I daydream now of my boyhood in&nbsp;the
	Upper Black River settlement, I see postcard winters and endless
	golden summers and a world filled with people I loved then as I love
