<p>	<b>The Family</b> <b>Chronicle</b><b></b></p>
<p>No.14									September 17, 2000</p>
<p><span><span class="Apple-converted-space">                                                                                                                                  </span>____________</span></p>
<p><span></span><b>Home-made Saw</b><b></b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Winter was the time to cut wood, not only for our own use but to sell; we usually sold 24' furnacewood.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The yard above the house would have a huge pile left in long lengths.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In the spring, the wood cutter would be set up to cut the wood into stove (16 in.) or furnace (24 in.) lengths<b>.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span></b>Logs too large to be wrestled to the table of the wood-cutter, were cut with a cross-cut saw.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I do not know where all the wood was sold but for about 20 years several cord of wood was sold to Vince Flaherity in Loggieville.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Dad also sold wood to the Branch school.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The story is told that Dad had sold a set number of cords of wood to the Branch school for a number of years and at the end of each school year there was a bit more left over than was the case the previous year.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Then the contract was changed to another supplier for the same number of cords.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Gradually the surplus was used up and the number of cords per year had to be increased.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>In early years the wood was hauled by sled or wagon; later a truck was hired to take the wood to Loggieville.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I recall one fall day when the truck was being loaded, the driver saying<span>@</span>you<span>=</span>re being too honest<span>@</span> with your measure.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Walter and John would go to the woods and cut, split and load a half cord on each of two sleds; the next day, they would deliver the wood to Chatham or Loggieville<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>- two men, two horses, two days plus the value of the wood for $5.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Walter also told me about he and Dad coming out from the woods in late afternoon with a load of wood when the wagon broke (I cannot recall what part broke). <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They unhitched the team and came on home for supper; later that night, they returned to the woods and Walter held the lantern while Dad cut a tree and fixed the wagon.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Anyway, what I really intended to tell was about one winter when the yard seemed fuller than usual of huge maple and beech trees cut on the <span>A</span>ridge<span>@</span>.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Dad, presumably with Walter and John helping, rigged up a powers saw to cut the logs into two-foot furnace wood.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The saw was set up in the back yard.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>My recollection is that there was a bed, perhaps 15 feet long, made of 2 x 8 or 10 inch plank 12 to 15 feet long and 2-3 feet wide; in it there were rollers to make it easy to roll the log along.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Toward the left end and cutting across the log was a <span>A</span>cross-cut<span>@</span> saw to which had been attached a handle.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The other end of the saw had a wooden shaft, not unlike that for a mowing machine.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The end of the shaft was attached to a mowing machine wheel with the lugs removed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When the wheel turned, the saw moved back and forth, again like a mowing machine knife.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There was a second mowing machine wheel, which acted as an idler wheel,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>mounted on the same shaft.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A belt was run from the engine to the idler wheel.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The belt was pushed from the idler wheel to the wheel with the saw in order to make the saw move back and forth.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Walter or John guided the end of the saw with the handle.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>It was crude but , as I recall, it worked; on the other hand, I cannot recall it being used a second winter</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Drownings</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>I was trying to recall the year that the two men were drowned at Victoria Bridge.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Seems to me they had been cutting or peeling pulp at Hexham or Bayside; I am not sure who they were working for.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Seems to me that one was named Larry Brideau and the other was ? Paul.<b><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span></b>After work on Saturday, they went for a swim and both drowned.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I know that a diver was brought in to search for the bodies.</p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Hexham</b><b></b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Speaking of Hexham, wasn<span>=</span>t there a MacLenaghan girl killed in an accident at the Hexham corner?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Seems to me that a stick came off as a pulp truck turned the Hexham corner and the stick went through a car window killing the girl.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Would that have been a sister of Marjorie (MacLenaghan) Gibson?</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>That is the corner where Uncle Bob and Aunt Bioney lived but I<span>=</span>ll save stories about them for a later Chronicle.</p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Cutting Hay at the Brook</b><b></b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Brydone told me that when Dad was sick, and he wasn<span>=</span>t well for a number of years, that he had Walter take him on the wheel barrow down to the brook where the men were scything hay.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>While Dad was not well enough to scythe, he would sit in the wheel barrow with his whetstone and sharpen extra blades so that the men had a sharp blade waiting each time they came by..<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Uncle Jim</b><span><b>=</b></span><b>s Machine Shed</b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>While visiting a pioneer village in Russia recently, I saw where they used to store machinery on the second floor of a barn or shed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You do not see that very often.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In fact, the only one I can remember was at Uncle Jim<span>=</span>s.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The end of the shed away from the road had a ramp and machinery was stored on the second floor.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Were there other machinery storage sheds like that?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Are any still standing?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Strange how one thinks of things.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Extinct Equipment</b><b></b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>When I travel, I like to visit museums especially agricultural museums.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In all of my visits, I have never encountered an actual or even a working model of a mud digger.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I guess, because they were large and awkward, and made of wood, they did not survive. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The other piece of equipment I have only encountered once is a horse-operated hay press - a forerunner of the hay baler.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I have not found one in a Canadian museum although a friend said that he saw one in a museum in Ontario.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I found two, in fact, at a museum in Las Cruces, New Mexico the year we visited Janet.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>These were heavy pieces of equipment and would likely go for scrap.</p>
<p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The hay press would be set up at a barn and was powered by a horse walking in a circle.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My job was to keep the horse moving and not to let it nibble at the bale as it emerged from the press.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Bales usually weighed from 90 to 110 pounds.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>John travelled from place to place in the fall with a team of horses and the hay press.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Later, when Norman purchased the tractor, the were able to travel even further from one end of the Miramichi to the other.</p>
