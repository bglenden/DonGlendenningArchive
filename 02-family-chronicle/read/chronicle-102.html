	the Glendenning family reunion in 2000, a red oak from Prince Edward
	Island, ,was planted at the old homestead, now the home of Norman
	Glendenning and family.  The photo above shows the tree five years
	later.  Standing by the tree is Jarret Glendenning, the youngest
	male Glendenning descended from Elmer and Jane (Watling Glendenning.
	 Jarret is the son of Eric and Jean Glendenning and grandson of
	Norman and Jean Glendenning.   Photo by Janet, 2005.</p>

	<h1 align="justify">Old Home Week</h1>
	<p align="justify" style="font-weight: normal"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify" style="font-weight: normal">We
	went to the Exhibition yesterday and, among other things, watched a
	4-H cattle judging event.  A couple of things came to mind as I
	watched.</p>
	<p align="justify" style="font-weight: normal"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify" style="font-weight: normal">One
	of the young heifers was reluctant to participate.  Each time the
	cows were to line up, this little black heifer balked.  Tugging on
	the lead rope did not help.  Finally, and frequently, one of the
	officials went over to the animal in question each time it balked,
	grabbed 
	</p>
	<p align="justify" style="font-weight: normal"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify" style="font-weight: normal">hold
	of the tail at the middle and gave a twist.  The animal moved along
	while the tail was being twisted.  I remember doing that when I was
	training my calf.</p>
	<p align="justify" style="font-weight: normal"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify" style="font-weight: normal">I
	belonged to a 4-H club in Black River.  Uncle Jim Watling, I
	believe, was instrumental in getting it started. I went to meetings
	and had a calf to care for.  One year, and I may have been a member
	for only one year, there was a 4-H show held at St. Stephen’s
	Church.  Uncle Jim offered to take my calf.  By then, my calf wasn’t
	small anymore.</p>
	<p align="justify" style="font-weight: normal"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify" style="font-weight: normal">My
	calf was loaded on a truck wagon, taken to the church grounds and
	unloaded.  I cannot remember how many animals, or people, were
	there.   We paraded our calves under the watchful eye of the judge
	while making sure the calf’s head was held high, and that it 
	stood to advantage.   I got a fourth Prize – there were four
	entries in the class.  We loaded our calves and returned home.  I’m
	glad that it wasn’t a larger class or my standing would have been
	even worse.</p>

	<h1 align="justify">Tornado at Black River</h1>
	<p align="justify" style="font-weight: normal"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify" style="font-weight: normal">Apparently
	the tornado went through Black River on Tuesday, May 17, 1932.  It
	took the roof of James “Major” MacDonald’s barn.  That is
	where Dad and I were at the time of the storm.  Mr. Macdonald had
	invited Dad to put his team in the barn until the storm passes but
	Dad said no, he would head for home.  The Gazette of May 18, 1932
	reports:</p>
	<p align="justify" style="font-weight: normal"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify" style="font-weight: normal">“On
	the North side of the river another barn, that o James (Major)
	MacDonald had the roof taken off and was so damaged that it will
	have to be rebuilt”.</p>
	<p align="justify" style="font-weight: normal"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify" style="font-weight: normal">In
	the same area, a barn belonging to Uncle Uncle Jack Godfrey was
	moved on its foundation and a henhouse belonging to William Murdoch
	was blown away and his hens disappeared.</p>
	<p align="justify" style="font-weight: normal"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify" style="font-weight: normal">The
	same tornado destroyed a barn, only five years old, belonging to
	James Godfrey, father of George and MacK Godfrey.  The barn was on
	the south side of the road; they later rebuilt but on the north side
	of the road but that barn has now been torn down.  Trees were blown
	down in the area and the Manse and homes belonging to James and
	Richard Godfrey were badly damaged.  Jack Gibson, who was a
	neighbour of James Godfrey, was battered by the gale and laid up as
	a result.</p>

	November 17 1952.  A headline in the 1941 issue &quot;Roosevelt

	is from a large farming family and he enjoys them, also. Dad keeps
	them in a binder so that he can reread them.&nbsp; So many of your
	memories are almost the same as the ones he heard from his Dad about

	there to refer to some part of Black River or Little Branch? Or
