<div class="reader-summary">Detailed genealogical chart tracing Jubal Watling (married Susan Leach, Nov 1814 in Metfield, Suffolk, England) through multiple generations with children&#x27;s names and dates. Notes contradictions between two possible Jubals (one from Suffolk, one from Norfolk/PEI) and explores whether they might be the same person. Includes 1841 PEI census data. Also documents Bill Glendinning of Moncton (descended from Dumfriesshire settlers in Galloway, NB) and the 25-year Glendenning family reunion tradition at Ken and Verne&#x27;s cottage in Point Aux Carr (last Saturday in July, averaging 40-50 attendees). Published August 19, 2003.</div>

<p>	i.	GEORGE<sup>2</sup> WATLING, d. USA (?).</p>
<p><br></p>

<p><br></p>

<p><br></p>
<p>Notes for EMMA WATLING:</p>
<p>Or is it Emily? No children; adopted a boy; lived in Bathurst, NB.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Notes for WILLIAM EDDY:</p>
<p>The Nipisiquit library carries the history of the Eedy family.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>	iv.	WILLIAM WATLING<i><sup>1</sup></i>, b. Abt. 1822; m. MARY MACNAUGHTON<i><sup>1</sup></i>, July 27, 1847; b. Abt. 1822.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Notes for WILLIAM WATLING:</p>
<p>Census of 1851 shows a "step-brother" (presumably a step-son) named Henry aged 14, living in the household.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>	v.	JUBAL WATLING<i><sup>1</sup></i>, b. May 6, 1823, Syleham, Suffolk, England<i><sup>1</sup></i>; d. 1900, Black River, NB<i><sup>1</sup></i>; m. CHRISTINA MACNAUGHTON<i><sup>1</sup></i>, Abt. 1845; b. 1823<i><sup>1</sup></i>; d. 1901<i><sup>1</sup></i>.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Notes for JUBAL WATLING:</p>
<p>Census of 1851 shows Jubal as age 28; Note in Kenneth Watling's database says "Migrated to USA <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Marriage date found in Anne Dunne’s database.</p>
<p>On April 9, 1851, Jubal Watling petitioned for 50 acres of land south of William MacBeath's Meadow lot and adjacent to a lot owned by John Edge.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span></span><b>New Watling Information</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Janet Watling shows Jubal and Susan with two additional children – John and Susannah.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><span>Any further information? Dates?</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Prince Edward Island Archives show a Jubal Watling living in Lot No. 52 at the time of the 1841 census.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Lot 52 is at the Eastern end of PEI near but not including Montague and Cardigan.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>According to the 1841 census, Jubal Watling was between 45 and 60 years of age, head of the family, his trade or occupation was that of a mason, he had 100 acres of land but one cannot tell if he rented or owned the land.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The household consisted of Jubal as head, one female between the ages of 45 and 60 presumably his wife, and 4 males under the age of 16.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Four members of the household were born in England and two were natives of the Island.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Other information in the PEI archives shows Jubal Watling married Louisa on 14 July 1831 and that they came from Norfolk County, England.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>An examination of the two sets of data shows that:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>One Jubal came from Norfolk and the other came from Suffolk.</p>
<p>The PEI Jubal has a different spouse; Susan Leach may have died and Jubal remarried.</p>
<p>The age brackets fit Jubal and Susan.</p>
<p>While my notes show only Jubal and Emily actually born in England, it is likely that the older children would have been born there also.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></p>
<p>Why would the girls not have been enumerated?</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Bill Glendinning</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>Loisanne (Glendenning) Gregan often talks with Bill Glendinning of Moncton whose ancestors come from Dumfries shire in Scotland.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I’ve since been in touch with him and look forward to meeting him. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>His father was Kenneth Glendinning, Grandfather was William, Great Grandfather was Walter and Great Great Grandfather was John.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Bill’s ancestors settled in Galloway, NB and are buried in the Galloway cemetery; his Grandfather moved to Charlo/New Mills, NB and his father moved to Moncton where Bill now lives.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I’ve compared names he provided with information I have about my family and, although we share many common family names, have not found any direct relationship.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Reunion</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>For 25 years, the Glendennings have gathered at Ken and Verne Glendenning’s cottage in Point Aux Carr for a potluck family reunion on the last Saturday in July.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The weather cooperated and most of the mosquitoes stayed away.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Over the years we averaged 40 to 50 people; this year, however, there were about 30.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Those traveling the longest distance included Vernon and Donna (Russell) Goodfellow from China, Anne Goodfellow from Australia and Doreen (Glendenning) Nicol from Ottawa.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Thanks to Ken and Verne for hosting this annual event.</p>
