	check your website regularly, and am always excited to see a new
	Chronicle. I was interested in your note on the Baptist Church. I,
	too, have heard of such a place of worship, and understood it to be
	on the Big Bob MacLean property (your late brother John's), on the
	south side of the road. Did I perhaps hear once that Big Bob lived
	in the old church after it was dissolved? I could be mistaken. <br />
&nbsp;<br />
I
	was with Janet Watling on one of her investigations to find those
	forgotten headstones; obviously to no avail. We have talked since of
	another such trip - on that particular journey we discovered only a
	half-buried box of car parts and a couple of license plates. I did
	once hear a story, perhaps from Uncle Harry Watling, about Big Bob
	and the circumstances surrounding the rate of mortality among his
	children. When someone was visiting, they asked Bob if he had ever
	had any children. He assured them that he had once had several, but
	not any more. When the visitor inquired as to what was their fate,
	Big Bob nodded towards his wife in the kitchen and said, &quot;She
	ate 'em.&quot; A bit of a sardonic response, but a good example of
	the kind of quick wit which so many Black Riverites possessed.</p>
