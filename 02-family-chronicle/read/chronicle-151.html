	My Great Grandmother on my
	father’s side of the family was a Harley, daughter of William and
	Ann (Bidders) Harley. William was born in Worcester, England about
	1750 and died in Courtmacsherry, County Cork, Ireland about 1830. 
	He was a school teacher.  His wife, Ann Bidders, was born about 1755
	in Swansea, Wales; raised her family in Ireland; after her husband
	died in 1930, Ann moved to Newcastle, NB where she died 1845.  We
	have not been able to

		William (1796-1838) came to
		New Brunswick about 1820 and worked as a surveyor.  In 1823, he
		married Ann MacLean and they had five children Prudence, William,
		Archibald, Eliza Ann and Susan Jane.  The family moved to Ontario
		about 1832 or 1833.  In 1834 Ann died shortly after the birth of
		their sixth child, James. William remarried Susannah Stewart and
		they had one daughter, Prudence.  A letter from William to Ann,
		written on November 28, 1832 will appear in a later Newsletter.</p></li>

		Mary Ann (1799-1898) came to
		Newcastle in 1822, married John Henry in 1823; they had nine
		children including Elizabeth, George, Nicoliena and William.  The
		Henry’s lived for a number of years in the Stonehaven /Clifton
		area. John Henry died in 1870 and Mary Ann moved to Portland to be
		with her children. (Regular readers may recall the account of Mary
		Ann’s 99<sup>th</sup>
		birthday party reported in Chronicle 134)  Nicoliena Henry married
		William John Stevens and they lived for a while in Canobie, NB. 
		The Stevens moved from Canobie to Portland in 1881 and, I believe,
		sold their farm in Canobie to my Grandfather, Walter Glendenning.  
		A descendant of Mary Ann reports having held John Henry’s Bible
		which is owned by another descendant in Upper New York State.</p></li>

		John, (1800-1875) came to
		New Brunswick in 1823 and worked as a shipbuilder with William
		Abrams on Beaubear’s Island (once known as Harley’s Island); he
		moved to the shipyard of Joseph Russell where he became foreman. 
		Later he and George Burchill bought Beaubear’s Island and the
		ship building business.  Harley and Burchill dissolved partnership
		and John Harley took over the business.  Following an economic
		downturn, John lost the business to the bank but remained active in
		the business community.   Russell Later he formed a partnership
		with George Burchill in shipbuilding.  John married Ann Coughlin
		and they had five children, Susan, Frances, William, Charles and
		John.  When John’s father died (1830) John’s mother, Ann, came
		to live with him in Newcastle.</p></li>
