	<p align="justify" style="orphans: 2; widows: 2">I
	had to replace my hard drive and lost some genealogical information
	as well as information for inclusion in the newsletter.  I also lost
	some email addresses.  If you sent email recently and have not had a

	<h5 align="justify" style="orphans: 2; widows: 2">The
	Sinclair Property</h5>
	<p align="justify" style="widows: 2; orphans: 2"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify" style="orphans: 2; widows: 2">You
	may recall that the grant where Norman Glendenning and Neil Watling
	now live, Lot #2, originally belonged to my  GGGrandfather,
	Alexander MacDonald.  The lot next to it, Lot #3, where Ian
	MacNaughton lived in my time, was originally granted to a Sinclair. 
	(I write this while traveling and do not have access to my notes to
	provide the first name.)</p>
	<p align="justify" style="orphans: 2; widows: 2"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify" style="orphans: 2; widows: 2">Recently
	I learned from Dorothy (MacKay) Lind that the Sinclair property was
	purchased by John MacNaughton, I do not know the year, who was
	married to Katherine Cameron.    Katherine and John had a number of
	children including Mary, who married John A. Mills.  John and Mary

	<p align="justify" style="orphans: 2; widows: 2"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify" style="orphans: 2; widows: 2">Mills
	had a daughter, Katherine, who married James (Uncle Jim) Watling. 
	So, after her marriage, Aunt Kate moved to the property next to the
	one where her mother was born and where her Uncle Donald MacNaughton
	still lived.  Because Aunt Kate’s mother died quite young, Aunt
	Kate spent considerable time at her grandfather’s home.</p>

	<p align="justify" style="widows: 2; orphans: 2"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify" style="orphans: 2; widows: 2">The
	item on watering the cows at the brook in winter reminded Donald
	Edge “of Fraser MacKay wading through deep snow to break a path
	for the cows to get down to the spring located in alders behind my
	grandfather's woodshed.&nbsp; Wading through snow and chopping holes
	in the ice, as hard work as it was, was easier than lugging pails of
	water from the house to the barn.&nbsp; The irony was that there was
	a pump in the barn, but we never seemed to be able to keep it from
	freezing.”</p>
	<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
	<h5 align="justify">The
	Dripping Cow Tail</h5>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">“Dripping
	cow tail” was used in a note from Donald Edge and seems
	appropriate when describing the process of milking cows by hand.  I
	am sure that many of the older readers will identify with the
	following experiences.</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">As
	I recall, we milked from 8-12 cows, the number varied.  There would
	be an equal and likely larger number of young cattle and dry cows. 
	Cattle stayed in the barn all winter, except for going to the brook
	for water, and in the fields all summer even being put out in the
	field at night after milking.  Summer cows were generally clean
	whereas winter cows were dirty and smelly – but all had to be
	milked.</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">We
	always milked cows in the barn although people with only a cow or
	two might take their pail to the field, next to the barn, and milk
	there.</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">The
	milking process is simple.  One takes a stool, three-legged was more
	stable than four, sits down beside the cow, and reaches under 
	</p>
	<p align="justify">brushing
	a hand over the udder to remove any dust, grass or dirt.  Then,
	taking a teat in each hand one gently but firmly closed the thumb
	and forefinger, and then the other fingers, forcing the milk down
	and out into the pail below.  One soon developed a rhythm of both a
	vertical hand movement and the squeezing with the fingers.</p>
	<p align="justify">We
	always held the pail between our legs although some, I believe, set
	the pail on the floor.  Having the pail between your knees, helped
	to keep the pail from being upset if the cow should kick.  While
	this did not happen very often, it did happen.  Tying a rope around
	the cow just ahead of the udder prevented her from kicking.  There
	was no defense, however, from the swishing tail.</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">While
	milking, it was not unusual for a cow to lazily swish her tail to
	scare away blackflies gathering on her flanks or back. 
	Occasionally, the gently swishing tale would catch one on the face
	or side of the head – not normally a problem, especially with a
	clean cow in summer.</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">In
	winter, however, cows were stabled and, especially a large cow, did
	not or could not, always keep her tail out of the trench behind her.
	 A tail could be loaded.  Even if the cow was standing for a while,
	the end of the tail remained wet.  A wet smack on the side of the
	head, although not pleasant, was not unusual.  It sure brought your
	mind back to the business at hand if you were thinking about the
	good time you had at the dance the night before.</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">Usually
	at least two of us milked at the same time and it was surprising how
	quickly one got the rhythm and could fill a pail of milk.  When I
	was very young, I used to take my tin mug and go to the barn while
	the older boys were milking.  They would fill my mug directly from
	the cow and I would drink it warm.  I couldn’t do that now.  
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">After
	the cow was milked, the pails of milk, each one holding about 10
	quarts, were carried to the house where the cream separator was
	located.</p>
	<p align="justify" style="page-break-after: avoid"><b>The
	Cream Separator</b></p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">A
	cream separator is an ingenious device.  At its heart is an cone,
	like a space capsule about 4 inches in diameter at the large end,
	filled with 8-10 or 12 thin metal discs like coffee filters.  The
	cone-shaped part is made to spin by turning the separator handle. 
	As the milk flowed down through, centrifugal force causes the liquid
	to move away from the center with the cream, being lighter, rising
	and the skimmed milk, being heavier, staying lower.  As it emerges
	from the cone the cream flows out of the upper spout and the skimmed
	milk flows from the lower.  The skim milk was fed to the pigs and
	the cream sold to the dairy or used at home to make butter.</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">Ours
	was a DeLaval separator with stainless steel parts where the milk
	was in contact. (It seems to me that Renfrew was also a popular
	brand.) It was my job, usually to run the separator.  One poured the
	fresh milk into the hopper, bowl at the top, then turned the crank
	to bring the separator up to speed.  Normally, one learned to judge
	the speed and to keep it constant.  Later models had a small bell
	that stopped ringing when the correct speed was reached or started
	ringing if one slowed the cranking process.  Once up to speed, the
	spigot was opened and the mild began to flow.</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">After
	each use, the separator had to be disassembled, including all the
	disks removed, washed in soapy water and rinsed thoroughly.  Unless
	one kept the separator clean, the cream would become contaminated
	and could bring a lower price or even be rejected at the creamery. 
	Once the cream cooled, it was transferred to a 3-5 gallon cream can
	and stored in the basement or, for a while, in a spring down at the
	brook – we did not have an icebox or refrigerator.</p>
