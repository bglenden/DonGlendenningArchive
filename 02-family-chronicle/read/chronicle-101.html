<div class="reader-summary">Family Chronicle (No. 101) dated August 22, 2005 covering two topics. First: establishment of Glendenning Fund through 2000 family reunion for charitable purposes with Black River theme; grants awarded for student essays and library books (photo shows Glendenning family members and school participants). Second: nostalgic recollection of fall food preservation at home—pickling, jelly-making, fruit drying, and wartime canning techniques. Detailed technical descriptions of pressure canning, boiling, cooling, and storage of canned vegetables and fruit for winter use. Mentions inclusion of home-canned items in overseas military parcels. Reflects Don&#x27;s pride in family charitable legacy and his documentation of rural domestic practices.</div>

	Readers may remember that the Glendenning Family established a Fund,
	as part of their family reunion activities in 2000.  Grants from the
	Fund may be made for any charitable purpose reflecting a Black River
	theme.  The first grant was made to Barry MacKenzie for an essay on
	“The MacKenzie Settlement and Klondike Will’.  A prize also went
	to Justin Morris for an essay on St. Stephen’s United Church.

	<p align="justify" style="font-weight: normal"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify" style="font-weight: normal">The
	second grant from The Glendenning Fund was made recently to the
	Miramichi Rural School for the purchase of library books.  The
	project was designed to maximize participation of students in the
	process including deciding on books to be purchased and, thanks to
	efforts of Loisanne (Glendenning) Gregan, actually visiting a
	bookstore to make the purchases.  The above photo shows members of
	the Glendenning Family and participants in the project along with
	books purchased.  Starting on the left are Caleb MacDonald,
	Christopher Sippley, Norman Glendenning, Kenneth Glendenning, Bryce
	MacDonald, Andrew Clarke (Principal) and Lucas Smith. (Photo

	As I was picking beans today,
	I thought about the preserving of fruit and vegetables at home.
	Cucumber pickles, chow and peaches went into bottles.  Apple and
	crab apple jelly was also preserved in bottles.  I really do not
	know the recipes or the process but I recall in the making of
	crab-apple jelly, the pulp from the apples and crabs being placed in
	a cotton cloth, (the corner of a flour bag perhaps?) and the juice
	dripping into the bottles.</p>

	<p align="justify" style="orphans: 0; widows: 0; font-weight: normal">
	On a few occasions I recall
	apples being dried in the big bedroom next to the driveway.  The
	apples were peeled and cored then cut into one-quarter inches thick
	(like a flat donut.  The “donuts” were strung on string, which
	was hung across the room to dry.</p>

	</p>
	<p align="justify" style="orphans: 0; widows: 0; font-weight: normal">
	Later, during the war, I
	think, we got a canning machine, which allowed vegetables, peas,
	beans, blueberries to be canned in a safe way.  Peas were taken from
	the pods, beans were “snapped” ends removed and broken into
	pieces about an inch long, the washed.  Beans were blanched but I am
	not sure about peas.  Blanching was accomplished by cooking them for
	a couple of minutes in boiling water; then they were rinsed in cold
	water.  
	</p>
	<p align="justify" style="orphans: 0; widows: 0; font-weight: normal">
	<br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify" style="orphans: 0; widows: 0; font-weight: normal">
	Cans were bought by the box
	(48?) and could be lined (a gold colour inside) or unlined.  I think
	that we always used lined cans; they were supposed to be safer. Some
	food items could not be preserved in unlined cans.  Covers were
	purchased separately.  The canner rotated the can and put increasing
	pressure on the lid so that the can and the lid were sealed
	together.</p>
	<p align="justify" style="orphans: 0; widows: 0; font-weight: normal">
	In preparation for cooking, a
	large pot, perhaps the bottom half of a barrel, was filled with
	water and a fire was build under it in the yard.  When the water was
	boiling, the cans were placed gently into the boiling water and
	boiled for a couple of hours.  After boiling, the cans were lifted
	out and cooled quickly in cold water in another tub, a wash tub as I
	recall..  When they were cooking, both ends bulged; after cooking
	and cooling, the ends snapped back.  When cooled, cans were
	inspected.  If any still bulged, they were opened and eaten for
	supper.</p>
	<p align="justify" style="orphans: 0; widows: 0; font-weight: normal">
	<br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify" style="orphans: 0; widows: 0; font-weight: normal">
	Cans were stored on a shelf
	in the basement and used throughout the winter.  If a can was found
	to have bulging ends, it was thrown away because of likely spoilage.</p>

	<p align="justify" style="orphans: 0; widows: 0; font-weight: normal">
	Home canned fruit and
	vegetables were sometimes included in packages sent to soldiers
	overseas.</p>

	 I do not remember the
	Italian Air fleet visiting Shediac (reported in the Chatham Gazette
	on Friday, July 14, 1933)  but I remember seeing photos in Life
	Magazine (Who remembers Life Magazine?) of several Italian
	commercial flying boats in the harbour at Shediac, N.B.  Apparently
	Shediac was a refueling stop on the flight from the USA to Italy.</p>

	On October 22, 1933, Rev. J.
	I Morrison, Minister of St. Stephens United Church, had an accident
	while driving to Hardwicke for a church service.   While driving his
	car across the Little Branch Bridge, something happened to the
	steering gear causing his car to clip four posts and end up with the
	front immersed in the Little Branch River.  Fortunately, Rev.
