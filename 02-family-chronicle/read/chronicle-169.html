<div class="reader-summary">Don&#x27;s speculative genealogical research on Jubal Watling (born 1790, married Susan Leach in 1814), who Don believed moved to Prince Edward Island after Susan&#x27;s death in England in 1829. Using PEI records of a second marriage to Louisa in 1831, census data, and photographs from researcher Caryl Savard, Don constructs a theory that Charles Watling (born 1846-47) could be Jubal&#x27;s son with Louisa, making Edythe and Ambrose Watling his grandchildren. Don acknowledges the circumstantial but plausible nature of this connection, noting Jubal&#x27;s age and the tight timeline present challenges to verification.</div>

	An email from Caryl Savard
	caused me to revisit my notes about my GGGrandfather, Jubal Watling
	who, according to family lore, lived on Prince Edward Island. 
	(Readers who are really interested should review Family Chronicles
	155-157)  First some facts.</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; widows: 2; orphans: 2; line-height: 100%">
	<br />

	</p>
	<p style="orphans: 2; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%; widows: 2">
	Jubal Watling was born in
	1790 and, on November 10, 1814, married Susan Leach who was born
	1792; names and dates of their offspring are given in Family
	Chronicle No. 157.  Susan died in England in 1929 and is buried in
	Syleham, Suffolk, England.  
	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; widows: 2; orphans: 2; line-height: 100%">
	<br />

	</p>
	<p style="orphans: 2; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%; widows: 2">
	I now believe that Jubal and
	his family came to PEI shortly after Susan died perhaps in 1830 but
	I do not have an exact date.  PEI records show a Jubal Watling
	married Louisa (maiden name not given) on July 14, 1831.</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; widows: 2; orphans: 2; line-height: 100%">

	<p style="orphans: 2; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%; widows: 2">
	The census of 1881 and 1891
	show a Charles Watling living in Charlottetown; according to the
	census, he would have been born in 1846 or 1847 and could,
	therefore, have been a child of Jubal and Louisa.  I have clippings
	that show Charles to have a son, Ambrose.  Charles has other
	children but Ambrose provides the link in this scenario.</p>

	PEI Marriages, 1844-1852,
	p349 reports that Louisa Watling, a widow, married Willie Smith, a
	widower in October but the year was not given.  The marriage was
	registered in 1848 so presumably the marriage was in October, 1847. 
	If it is the same Louisa, Jubal must have died before that –
	between 1841 and 1847.</p>

	<p style="orphans: 2; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%; widows: 2">
	Enter Caryl Savard, a direct
	descendant of William and Louisa Smith; Caryl believes that Louisa
	and William were both originally from England.  Caryl’s research
	finds that William and Louisa had at least two children: Margaret
	born on April 24, 1848 and Mary Ann born on August 15, 1851; they
	were both&nbsp;baptised on May 10, 1853. 
	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Caryl
	has an album of early family photos and, in an Email to me on
	December 30 2008, she wrote:</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">“<i><b>I
	found two pictures, one of Edythe and one of Ambrose. The name is
	Watlin on the back of each photo. On Edythe's it was written, To
	Aunt Maggie From Edythe Watlin, 1/2 2nd cousin. On the back of
	Ambrose's, it reads Ambrose Watlin, 1/2 2nd cousin.”</b></i></p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">In
	my books that makes Edythe and Ambrose both children of Charles and,
	assuming that Charles is a child of Jubal and Louisa, and Margaret
	and Mary Anne are children of William and Louisa Smith (and that
	Louisa is the same person in both cases) Charles would be a
	half-brother of the two Smith girls.  
	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">If
	the above scenario is accurate, Margaret (Maggie) Smith would be an
	Aunt to Ambrose and Edythe hence the note on the back of the photo.
	(Although I do not understand the reference to ½ second cousin.) I
	realize that the connection is circumstantial but believe that it is
	more than coincidental.</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Watling
	is relatively rare name and Jubal even rarer, the actual names on
	the photos and the reference to Aunt Maggie – all strong but not
	conclusive. A negative is Jubal’s age – he would have been 41
	when he married and in his late 50’s and early 60’s when the
	children were born.  The birth of Charles in 1847, marriage of
	Louisa and William in 1847 and birth of Margaret in 1848 presents a
	tight but not impossible schedule.  Readers probably know the
	expression that “the first child can be born any time but after
	that it usually takes nine months”. 
	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">If
	this thinking is correct, Grandfather Jubal, married to Christina
	MacNaughton would be a half-brother to Charles and any descendants
	of Charles would be my/our cousins.  Needless to say, I find this an
	interesting turn of events and will keep you posted of anything new
	that comes to hand.</p>
