<p><b>Did you know that the present Black River Community Hall is the third building on the same site?</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Like most communities of the day, schools in Black River served as centers for community gatherings.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My sister, Lillian, recalled many dances in the Little Branch School at which my father volunteered to sell candy and pop, take tickets, and help with setting up and cleaning up afterwards.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Many others in the community, I know, could say the same about their parents and neighbours at their local school. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>This changed in 1931 with the opening of the Black River Community Hall on the same site as the current building.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Most of the information that follows was gleaned and interpreted from The Book of Accounts for the Black River Community hall for the period 1930 to 1973.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Discussion about a community hall, I am sure, consumed considerable time in the community.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In any case, on October 20, 1930, the first loads of gravel and sand were taken to the site by George Cameron, A. W. MacDougall, Harold Godfrey and Robert Harper.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Wallace MacDonald worked that day but did not haul gravel. Forms were built on October 21 and 22 and on October 23 and 24 concrete was poured.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A dream began to take shape.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>A week later a crew of carpenters gathered and began to frame the new building.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Three weeks later, the structure was closed in including, I believe, shingles on the roof <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Neighbours engaged in carpentry included George Godfrey, Alfred MacLean, James Mortimer, Elmer Glendenning, Harold Godfrey, Ian MacNaughton, Ian Mortimer, Bert Gibson and Sinclair Williston. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Not all mentioned above worked every day; others not named also worked but apparently not at carpentry.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>On November 13, 1930, the building was closed in including shingles on the roof; work ceased for the winter.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Financial records show initial donations of $100 from Robertson Orange Lodge #49 and $300 from the Little Branch Dorcas Club; The Dorcas Club also contributed another a bit over the next few months.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>These funds, together with donated materials and time, enabled the Hall Committee to close in the building.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>From then on, the Committee was able to pay bills as they were incurred.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>On May 25, 1931 the first dance was held in the new hall; this added $72.50 to the coffers; on June 26 another dance added an additional $40.50.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I cannot tell who played for the first dance but the musicians were paid $9.00.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Mont MacDonald often played, sometimes accompanied by Harry MacDonald or Arthur Taylor.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Most of the building materials came from W &amp; R Walch (or Welch?), A &amp; R Loggie Company, J W MacNaughton and Herb Fowlie.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>John MacDonald and Duncan MacDonald appear to have been regular paid carpenters</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The next flurry of construction began on October 17, 1931 and concluded on November 11.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It appears that the roof was shingled in 1931 and the walls were completed in 1932.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The two-story structure, valued at $1500, was reported to be 50 feet long and 34 feet wide and, I believe, was balloon style framing. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The Chatham Gazette of Friday, August 26, 1932 carried the following item on page 1. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p>A cheque for $1000 was deposited in the Hall Account, outstanding bills were paid, books were closed with the last entry being November 20 1932 and Alfred H. MacLean performed an audit. The result of the two years of hard work was a cash balance of $587.06 in a bank account belonging to the Black River Community Hall. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p>A fire of unknown origin Wednesday night consumed the new hall recently erected by the people of Black River Bridge as a community center, and utterly destroyed it, not one stick remaining to mark the spot.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Even the concrete foundation was rendered worthless by the intense heat of the blaze.”</p>
