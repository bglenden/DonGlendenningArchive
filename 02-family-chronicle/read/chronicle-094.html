<p><b>Some North Shore Notes </b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I wrote to you some while back about my Mother, Eva Peters, who had done a history correspondence course when she was in her late 60's back in 1984.  She had never gone beyond Grade 8 in her small school in Clifton (high school required room and board in Bathurst, which her family could not afford).  However, in her later years she restarted her education, beginning with Grade 9 History, at which she excelled.  I used to tease her that she was not learning so much as remembering!  She relied a lot on her early memories of growing up on the North Shore, and her essays were filled with references to those times.  Her teacher enjoyed reading her work too, and even had one essay published in "The Correspondent", which was produced by the Ministry of Education here in Ontario.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In case you are a bit shy of material for "The Family Chronicle", I hereby have retyped passages from my mother's essays:</p>
<p> </p>
<p><i>"The smart settler always left a good stand of trees to the northwest of his house - a fuel saver as most of our cold winds come from the northwest.  We had our house built on the highest ground and the well set well back from the barn and other buildings".</i><i></i></p>
<p> </p>
<p><i>"We had all our out buildings - sheep shed, hen house and granary - built of logs.  My brother and I delighted in getting in the woods and he could really build a hut for us to have as our own.  First and very important - you level off your foundation, then notch each end of the log to fit as close to its mate as you can.  You add the walls to shoulder height and then you raise your main pole in the centre of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></i></p>
<p><i>the roof, again notching smaller logs to make your slanting roof.  Don't forget your hole for the stove pipe to come through.  Then there's the job<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></i></p>
<p><i></i><br></p>
<p><i>of hauling water from the nearby brook and gathering moss and, best of all, red clay and cork in between the chinks.  Many's the drop of rain we had to dodge as our roof never seemed to really work."</i><i></i></p>
<p> </p>
<p><i>"Schools then had one room and one teacher for all classes.  I think the younger children not only learned their own ABC's but they listened and learned things in the higher grades and it made learning very easy for them.  They walked miles to school, rosy-cheeked and healthy.  Today it's a bus, computers and while we know we have advanced, I really think I would choose maybe not the real old times but somewhere in between where I could walk from home and know each child."</i><i></i></p>
<p> </p>
<p><i>"The church was very important to the pioneers for moral support.  No matter what their old religion was they were all welcome in the church in their community.  It also kept the people united.  If the church needed repairs it meant a gathering of all the people - men to do the outside and women the inside.  There is a church still standing today in Clifton N.B. for which the women made all the shingles by hand.  The pulpit which is still there is carved out of wood and was all done by hand."</i><i></i></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Needless to say, my mother got a mark of 100% on this particular lesson!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The following is longer and from another essay:</p>
<p> </p>
<p><i>"Because my ancestors were from Ireland and Scotland it has always been kept very alive in our family the conditions why they left.  The peat fires and smoke returning down the chimney - cold and drafts - mud stuffed between the cracks - porridge - sugar unheard of - milk scarce and not a crumb wasted, children crying not understanding why.  My grandfather used to keep us fascinated with stories of his father spearing fish in forbidden streams and even the bones made into broth.  Sickness and death and the closeness of family and friends.  Even today old habits die hard and in communities of Irish descent what one has is willingly divided.  I remember my father dividing his seed oats with a neighbour who had his barn destroyed by fire.  Some one came around and collected and each gave. He even ended up with 12 hens and enough seed to start over.  Sickness and death neighbours sit around the clock, and people come for miles to help out. </i></p>
<p><i></i><br></p>
<p><i><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>When we visit N.B. on vacation my family can never get enough searching around the old farm and meadow and finding pieces of old harness hand made preserved these many years.  Cemeteries with carved stone taken from the cliffs and beaches.  The old names as clear as the day inscribed.  The old names live on, maybe the young generation do not really appreciated the old way of life.  Many have been lured to other provinces with quick money but many are returning to the land.  I find so many going back to retire.  Knitting, quilting and crafts are making a great come-back.  I just wish I had really listened to my grandfather as we used to sit and half listen to wisdom he had so gladly passed on.  I was very young when he passed away - 103 years old, his corner in the huge old kitchen by the window - he could look out on the Chaleur Bay.  Home made rocker and my last memories of him sitting in his long red home knit underwear and a quilt over his knees.  Things we hear today criminals sent to Australia and Canada and I think the older ones loved to weave a story to make us afraid of who we were and years later when we had the reports from visitors I think we all were relieved our forefathers had paid their way and were honest, proud but poor immigrants.  Some were preachers and a couple were scholars and soon a meeting place and a school sprung up.  All were joined together - very strong ties.  They settled and the Government gave them land and they had to clear and prove up on it.  Then they had to walk 70 miles one way to Fredericton to register and get the deed.  Came back rejoicing they were land owners.  Long tales of their encounters with animals and full of black fly bites.  So the community grew.  World War I, the old men, women and children kept the farms going.  Many men never returned, but with help the families continued on.  World War II was a repeat and the Depression in full swing. </i></p>
<p><i></i><br></p>
<p><i><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Even then very few newspapers but the Family Herald was passed on from family to family.  News of soup kitchens and hard times reached their ears, but they on the farm had more than enough - eggs, butter, meat and flour and the Bay full of lobster, salmon, cod and many kinds of fish.  We had our own maple bush and had maple syrup year round.  We all had moccasins and snow shoes and our bought shoes were saved for occasions.  Toys were home made and Christmas meant the pick of the turkey crop.  Christmas tree decorated with coloured yarn and paper.  We had a surplus of goose and chicken feathers for ticks and pillows.  My prized possessions are feather pillows and my grandmother's rocker.  Now this may not explain why they left the old country, but I often think of the pride they took in their land, home and animals and I know now it was because they had nothing and worked so hard and so valued their new country - yet the old land was not forgotten.  A get-together was never complete until someone started the Irish songs.  Danny Boy was the first song learned around the kitchen table and St. Patrick Day was celebrated."</i><i></i></p>
