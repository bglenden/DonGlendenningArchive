	Hardwicke, NB.   Art is holding the family Bible belonging to his
	Great Grandfather, Alexander Mills;  displayed on the table is the

	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">While
	in the Miramichi recently, I learned:</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

	</p>
	<ul>
		<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
		Old timers will remember a
		brook on the McKnight Road near Carmel United Church where we used
		to drive through and allow the horses to drink, and also soak the
		wagon wheels to keep the joints tight,  Everard MacLean tells me
		that it was called Sammy John’s Brook – as I recall, it passed
		through property owned by Sammy John McKnight.</p></li>
		<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
		Chatham Grammar School was
		originally the Chatham Presbyterian College.</p></li>
		<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
		Gordon Dick purchased the
		original school bus from the Godfrey Bros. and transported students
		from Point Aux Carr and Napan to Chatham.</p></li>
		<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
		There was a root cellar on
		the original Alexander MacDonald property, back of where Neil
		Watling now lives and we wondered why it would have been so far
		from the family home.</p></li>
		<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
		In 1939, as best I can find
		out, there was only one place in Black River to buy gasoline and
		that was from George Adams.  He had a hand operated pump and one
		bought gasoline by the gallon.  One pulled close to the tank, told
		the number of gallons wanted, the gasoline was pumped into a glass
		chamber at the top of the tank with the number of gallons was
		measured by eye, then the hose was put into the car tank and
		gravity did the rest.  The next nearest gas tanks were at
		Robertson’s store at the Bay du Vin bridge or at Doug Campbell’s
		store at the Richibucto and south Napan road</p></li>
		<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
		I only remember the
		blacksmith shop at Sinclair Williston’s, however, my brothers
		remember that John Dick also had a blacksmith shop in Upper Black
		River as well.</p></li>
		<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
		Our nearest grocery store
		was run by George Adams across the river from our place.  Down
		river the next one was at Dilworth MacDonald’s just below the
		Hexham corner; while John MacLean had a grocery store, Everard
		thinks it closed in the early 1930’s; Rueben MacLenaghan ran a
		store at Middle Black River but probably not in 1939; in 1940 Sandy
		MacNaughton in Upper Black River ran a small store in his house.</p></li>
		<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
		I welcome corrections and
		additional information on any and all of the above.</p></li>
	</ul>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Remember
	when:</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

	</p>
	<ul>
		<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
		Mother used a large vanilla
		bottle, punched holes in the cap, filled it with water and used it
		to sprinkle clothes when ironing.</p></li>
		<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
		Headlight dimmer switches
		were on the floor boards.</p></li>
		<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
		Cars did not have fuel
		pumps; fuel tanks were mounted in front of the windshield and
		gravity caused the fuel to flow to the engine.</p></li>
		<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
		Movie theatres showed
		newsreels prior to the main show.</p></li>
		<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
		We made pea shooters out of
		clothespins</p></li>
		<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
		Laundry was washed by hand
		in a tub placed on a washstand.  Another tub was placed on the
		other end of the stand and standing between was a wringer to wring
		water from clothes before either rinsing or hanging them out to
		dry.</p></li>
		<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
		Drivers signaled their
		intentions by extending their arm out the window; Arm pointing up
		meant a right hand turn, straight out meant a left turn and pointed
		toward the ground indicated slowing down or stopping; making a
		circular motion told the driver that he could/should pass.  Turn
		signals appeared only after the War.</p></li>
		<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
		Cars had a rack at the rear
		for carrying suitcases and heavy boxes.</p></li>
		<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
		Spare tires, and some cars
		carried two, were mounted outside the car either at the rear or set
		into the back of the front fenders.</p></li>
		<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
		When visitors came,
		especially in winter, the first task was to stable the horse to
		provide shelter, hay and water.  
		</p></li>
		<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
		Car radiators had to be
		drained in winter; the first antifreeze was alcohol but it often
		boiled away and lost its protective use.</p></li>
		<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
		One earned spending money by
		picking up liquor and beer bottles from the ditches.</p></li>
		<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
		When crossing the river by
		horse and sled on a stormy night, one dragged a chain behind to
		ensure that one was not moving in a circle</p></li>
