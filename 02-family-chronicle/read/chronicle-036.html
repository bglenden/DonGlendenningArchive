	<h5>Follow-up</h5>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>In the
	last issue, I mentioned our Aladdin lamp.  I was reminded by Donald
	Edge just how different a light it provided.  It was both much
	brighter and much whiter, presumably because of the use of a mantle.
	 It was obvious when passing a house at night which ones had an
	Aladdin lamp.  Tina Newton tells me that she and her sister used to
	play Flinch with her Grandfather, my Uncle George Watling.</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<h5>Family
	Profiles</h5>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>As part of
	my family tree activity, I am preparing profiles of each of my
	siblings.  These profiles when completed will appear in future
	issues.</p>

	<h5>The
	Family Chronicle</h5>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>Off and on
	for 50 years, I have been gathering 
	</p>
	<p>information
	about my ancestors.  There is not much point in having information
	unless you share it.  The 
	</p>
	<p>Family
	Chronicle is the result.  The early issues were very family
	oriented.  More recently, I have begun to reminisce about Black
	River as I recall it.  Obviously, the notes reflect my family and my
	era.  I make no apology for the focus but, in view of the wider
	distribution, thought it deserved a comment.  Articles are not
	researched but simply presented as I recall them.  I sit at my
	computer and you get what ever occurs to me at that moment. 
	Remember, all memory is selective; some items may even be repeated.
	Others may contain errors.</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>The Family
	Chronicle is available in Email only and readership has now reached
	34.</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>By the
	way, I am very interested in receiving information, including
	photos, about Black River, its people and events.  The more
	information I gather the more I realize that most any resident of
	Black River is likely to be a relative.  Some day I will write a
	note about family relationships.  
	</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<h5>Truck</h5>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>In
	reminiscing about family vehicles, I forgot to mention the 1944(?)
	Dodge or Fargo 21/2-ton truck, which John bought from Hubert
	Matchett (I think).  It 
	</p>
	<p>was khaki
	colour and used for hauling wood, Christmas trees, gravel, etc.  I
	never drove it.  One day, however, Ken asked me to take the truck to
	pick up Jack Gibson to butcher a cow or pig.  I was prepared to go
	but, on learning that I had not driven the truck before, Ken decided
	to go himself.  He was stopped by the RCMP near Alex MacDonald’s. 
	Fortunately, Ken had a driver’s license; I did not.  I am not sure
	what the fine was for driving without a license.</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<h5>Driving
	License</h5>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>Like most
	young fellows, I drove for a number of years without a driver’s
	license.  In 1949 I went with 
	</p>
	<p>Norm when
	he went to pick up his new truck.  While waiting for the truck to be
	serviced, Norm asked me if I had a license.  I didn’t.  He
	suggested I get one.  I asked what one did to get a license.  The
	license bureau was on Water Street near Hachey’s corner.  I went
	down and picked up an application.  It required someone to certify
	that I could drive.  Norm suggested that I ask Glenn McTavish to
	sign.  I asked, “Who is Glenn MacTavish”  Norman took me to the
	door of Lounsbury’s garage and pointed him out.  He was the
	service foreman.  I went over to Glenn, identified myself and told
	him what I wanted.  He asked if I could drive.  I said yes.  He
	signed my application and I got my first drivers license.  As I
	recall, it cost me $2.00.</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<h5>Blacksmith Shop</h5>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>Sinclair
	Williston was a blacksmith.  He lived in a long lane just above the
	Hexham corner.  The blacksmith shop was between his house and the
	road.  We went there to have horses shod or shoes sharpened (usually
	for winter work).  I can only remember going there in the summer
	and, it seems to me, that the horses were shod outside although I am
	sure that they could have stepped into the shop in bad weather. 
	Sinclair could not only shoe horses, he could make or repair wagon
	rims, sled shoes, chains, etc.  He could make rings and hooks for
	sleds or wagons, and many other things.  He also had a contraption
	(a sling) to use when shoeing horses that would not stand still when
	being shod.</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>Sinclair
	would lift the horses hoof and hold it between his knees when
	cleaning and shaping a hoof and again when nailing on a shoe.  Each
	shoe required 8 nails – a square, tapered nail also used for
	making darts.  Then he would put the horse’s hoof on a tripod
	while shaping the hoof around the new shoe.  One had to be careful
	when cleaning a horse’s hoof in order not to cut the “quick”
	and lame the horse.</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>A
	blacksmith shop was a special place with its distinctive smell, the
	sound of hammer striking the metal on the anvil, the forge and
	bellows, the sparks, etc.</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>Sinclair
	was a warm and friendly man.  I remember once when I was walking
	somewhere he stopped and gave me a drive.  In fact, he let me sit on
	his knee and steer the car.  I am not sure what kind of car he had
	but I think it was a Chevrolet.  I know that it was not a Ford. 
	Sinclair died quite young.  I remember also going to Sinclair’s
	when his house burned; it was engulfed in flames by the time we
	arrived.</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<h5>Earning
	Money</h5>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>I do not
	remember having an allowance when I was very young but do remember
	money to buy candy or ice cream.  When I was a teenager, I remember
	Norm, Ken or John giving me money if I was going in town, going to a
	dance or going to a movie on Saturday night.  One could get along
	without much cash.  One time I went to Chatham with Uncle Jim by
	horse and wagon via Richibucto Road before it was paved.  We usually
	traveled via Loggieville and stopped at Aunt Tines.  Before we left
	town, Uncle Jim treated me to ice cream at Gray’s Ice Cream
	Parlour which was, as I recall, across the street but not far from
	Ben’s Canteen.  
	</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>To earn
	money, sometimes we bought packages of flower and vegetable seeds
	from Steele Briggs Company (?) and peddled them to neighbours.  Also
	we bought and sold cards – Valentines and Easter cards, I think,
	but probably Christmas cards as well.</p>
	<p><br />
