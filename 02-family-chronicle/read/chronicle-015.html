<p><b>Alexander MacDonald</b><b></b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The GLEANER and Northumberland, Kent, Gloucester and Restigouche Commercial and Agricultural Journal (p30) reports the following death in 1843:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span>A</span>On the 31st of October, of dropsy, after an illness of eight months, which he here with truly Christian resignation to the divine will, Mr. Alexander MacDonald, of Little Branch, Black River, in the 68<sup>th</sup> year of his age, thus leaving a disconsolate wife, in the evening of her days, two sons and six daughters, to mourn the loss of an affectionate husband and tender father.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He calmly resigned his spirit into the hands of his Maker, in the firm hope of blessed immortality.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><span>A</span>Blessed are they who die in the Lord.<span>=</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Mr. MacDonald was a native of the Parish of Assynt, Rosshire, Scotland and emigrated to this country in the year 1803.<span>@</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Recently I checked the internet and found Assynt to be a Parish in Rosshire, Scotland.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is located in the northern part of Scotland along the west coast and includes many islands.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Grace MacAskill, his wife, came from Sutherland County which adjoins Rosshire.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Both counties are extremely hilly and rocky with many inlets and streams, and with little in the way of agricultural land.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Grace (MacAskill) MacDonald</b><b></b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The Union Advocate, Newcastle, Miramichi, NB, A Weekly Journal Dedicated to Literature, Education, Politics, Agriculture, General<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Intelligence and Useful Information, reported the following death ion Wednesday, March 4, 1874:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span>A</span>At Little Branch, Black River, on the 23<sup>rd</sup> of February, Grace, relict of Alexander Macdonald, aged 93 years.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Deceased was a native of Co. Sutherland, Scotland and came to this country in the year 1803.<span>@</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Elspeth (Jardine) MacDonald</b><b></b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Following my recent visit to the Miramichi, I received a phone call from Velna Dickson saying that a search of St. Stephen<span>=</span>s church records shows that Elspeth (Jardine) MacDonald, my Great Grandmother, died of <span>A</span>debility<span>@</span> on<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>September 12, 1907 and is buried in St. Stephen<span>=</span>s Cemetery.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Presumably, John MacDonald, her husband is buried there also but I have not been able to confirm this.</p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Jubal and Grace (MacDonald)Watling</b><b></b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The Gazette of February 19 1915 reported the death of Jubal Watling, my Grandfather and The Chatham Gazette of September 28, 1934, reported the death of his wife, Grace (MacDonald) Watling.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Grace (MacDonald) Watling</b><b></b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I have an undated clipping in my possession which reads as follows:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span>A</span>MRS. JUBAL WATLING</p>
<p><br></p>
<p></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The funeral of the late Mrs. Jubal Watling took place from her late residence Saturday afternoon and was largely attended.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The service was conducted by Rev. A. R. Gibson of Chatham assisted by Rev. J. I. Morrison, of Black River, and the Rev. J. E. Forbes of Loggieville.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Mrs. F. A. Fowlie rendered a solo <span>&gt;</span>Go Bury Thy sorrow.<span>=</span><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The eighth chapter of Romans was read as Mrs. Watling had requested.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><span>&gt;</span>The Lord<span>=</span>s My Shepherd<span>=</span> and <span>&gt;</span>Safe in the Arms of Jesus,<span>=</span> favourite hymns of the deceased were sung.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The floral offerings were many and beautiful.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The pallbearers were Norman MacKenzie, Walter Glendenning, Gordon MacNaughton, Alex Newton (grandson), Jubal Dickson<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>and James Jardine.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Interment was made in St. Stephen<span>=</span>s cemetery.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Mrs. Watling was a lifelong Presbyterian, a sincere Christian, woman whose kingdom was her home and her children rise up to call her blessed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Her gentle kindly ways endeared her to all who knew her and she will be greatly missed in the community.<span>@</span></p>

<p>At the Family Reunion in July, Cameron MacDonald provided me with a photocopy of some pages from the School Register kept by Jessie Macdonald, a Third Class Teacher, for District 11, Parish of Chatham. County of Northumberland for the period commencing April 2, 1860 and ending June 30, 1860: the photocopy is quite dim.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Names recorded include McKnight, Gilliys(?), Jardine, Lockerbie, Murdoch, Dickson, Murphy, Carruthers, Joudry and Brymer.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>There were 38 pupils registered in the month of June, 1860 with the youngest being John Jardine age 4 and the oldest being Robert Gilliys(?) Aged 17. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Cameron also provided a copy of the contract between Jessie Macdonald and the Trustees.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Again, some I cannot read and the remainder is difficult to read.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span>A</span>We, the undersigned, do agree to pay to Jessie McDonald ... the several sums annexed to our names for the purpose of teaching a school in district No. 11, Parish of Chatham, County of Northumberland, for 6 months commencing ... , 1858 and the said Jessie McDonald agrees to teach a regular school for 6 months in said place according to rules given by Inspector for this County.</p>
