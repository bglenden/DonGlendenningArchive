	<h1>The Second
	Black River Community Hall</h1>
	<p align="justify" style="font-weight: normal"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="font-weight: normal">The
	ashes were hardly cold on the First Community Hall (Burned to the
	ground about midnight, August 24, 1932) when planning began for the
	second.  A note in my father’s hand dated November 1, 1932
	provides a quick list of the lumber required. It reads:</p>
	<p align="justify" style="font-weight: normal"><br />

	<p align="justify" style="font-weight: normal"><i>Lumber
	needed to build hall - dated November 1, 1932</i></p>

	<p align="justify" style="font-weight: normal"><br />

	</p>
	<h2>By April 1, 1933, lumber was being purchased
	from John W. MacNaughton and Eldon Fowlie; in June cement and nails
	were purchased from A &amp; R Loggie Co., insurance was purchased
	from Dora Johnson in July, and door bolts and bricks were purchased
	in August.  The W &amp; R Welch Company was also a supplier of
	building materials.</h2>
	<p align="justify" style="font-weight: normal"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify" style="font-weight: normal">The
	new hall was put to use in July 1934; that was a busy month with
	three events producing income, the first for the new building.  The
	first was a field day on July 12 at which ice cream brought revenue
	of $9.45; a dance on July 13, 1934 with proceeds before expenses of
	$26.65. and  a “Program at Hall” on July 26 put an additional
	$15.00 in the coffers.  1934 ended with a positive balance of $7.12.
	
	</p>
	<p align="justify" style="font-weight: normal"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify" style="font-weight: normal">Little
	is known about construction activities during 1935 except for the
	purchase of shingles and nails and some people were paid for
	shingling.  While the hall continued to be used from then on, it
	appears there was little in the way of construction.</p>
	<p align="justify" style="font-weight: normal"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify" style="font-weight: normal">In
	June of 1939 or 1940. Jane Glendenning made a loan of $300; it was
	repaid over the next 3-4 years.</p>
	<p align="justify" style="font-weight: normal"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify" style="font-weight: normal">It
	appears that a well was drilled on the site in the spring of 1947
	with the purchase of 60 feet of one and one-quarter inch pipe from
	the Lounsbury Co. and casing from Everard MacLean.  A payment was
	made to Everard for drilling the well and Wallace and Downey
	provided some pipe fitting service.  The hall was wired in the fall
	of 1948 and incurred an electric bill of less than $3.00 per month
	for each of the next few months.</p>
	<p align="justify" style="font-weight: normal"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify" style="font-weight: normal">Records
	show rent of $6.00 from the rifle club in December, 1952.  The
	upstairs area was opened up and developed for indoor shooting
	practice. The end of the building nearest the road was sandbagged
	and metal plates were inserted in the wall for safety.  I recall
	going to the hall for target practice.</p>
	<p align="justify" style="font-weight: normal"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify" style="font-weight: normal">In
	1967 Canada celebrated its centennial as a country.  To mark the
	event, communities were invited to undertake significant local
	events for which financial assistance was available.  Black River
	decided to undertake a major renovation including new stairs at
	front of hall, upgrading the second floor and new washrooms.</p>
	<p align="justify" style="font-weight: normal"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify" style="font-weight: normal">In
	February, 1973, disaster struck and the Black River Centennial Hall
	was again consumed by fire</p>
	<p align="justify" style="font-weight: normal"><br />

	</p>
	<h3 align="justify">Alberta Jack</h3>
	<p align="justify" style="font-weight: normal"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="font-weight: normal">On
	June 12, 1937 Alberta Jack blew into Black River.  He rented the
	Community Hall for a fee of $5.00.  Dressed in flashy western
	clothes, he provided a couple of hours of western music and corny
	jokes.  It was a beautiful summer evening; the hall was packed.  I
	was there but cannot remember the cost of tickets.</p>

	<p align="justify" style="font-weight: normal"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify" style="font-weight: normal">I
	had an email recently from a woman in Minnesota wondering if I had a
	photo of a set of bobsleds.  I don’t – but I would love to
	obtain one and would publish it in this newsletter.  If you have one
	and are willing to share it, please send it along either
	electronically or by snail mail.</p>
