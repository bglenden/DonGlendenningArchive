	</p>
	<p align="justify">Nearly
	60 members of the extended Glendenning family gathered in Point Aux
	Carr on July 31 for our annual family get-together – every year
	since 1977.  It was great to see so many young people.  While family
	gatherings are always informal, we did help Ken and Verne celebrate
	their 80<sup>th</sup>
	birthdays and also presented a plaque to thank them for hosting the
	family gatherings for almost 30 years.  Our thanks also to Loisanne
	(Glendenning) Gregan and her helpers for organizing our food and
	drinks, and for the delicious birthday cake.    Next year’s
	reunion will be on the last Saturday of July as usual.   Plan now
	for 2005.</p>
	<p style="page-break-after: avoid"><b>Little
	Branch Bridge</b></p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>Covered
	bridges were common.  In my time there were three at Black River –
	Little Branch, Victoria near the mouth of the river at Hexham and
	the Cameron Bridge at Middle Black River.  The Victoria Bridge was
	the longest.  All have now disappeared; the Branch and Cameron
	Bridge having been replaced with concrete bridges; the Victoria
	Bridge was not replaced.  For readers not familiar with the area,
	the road leading up the Little Branch was just behind the
	photographer and the Little Branch School, still standing, was built
	at the junction of the two roads.</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>The sign
	on the Little Branch Bridge reads, 
	</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p align="center" style="page-break-after: avoid"><b>TWENTY
	DOLLARS FINE</b></p>
	<p align="center"><b>FOR
	DRIVING OVER THIS BRIDGE FASTER THAN A WALK</b></p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>The reason
	for the restriction was to reduce the chances of damage to the
	structure.  A team of horses trotting across the bridge could
	harmonize with the flexing of the span causing tremendous pressure
	and weaken if not crack the spans.</p>

	<h6 style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">Another Marriage</h6>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>I am grateful to Jennie Foley (we are both
	descended from John Peters and Jane (Sealey) Peters) for some
	additional family information.</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>My Great Grandfather, John Peters, married Jane
	Sealey.  They had a family of thirteen including my Grandmother
	Elizabeth and Jennie’s Grandfather, Robert Henry Peters.</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>When Jane died in 1892, John married Ann Sarah
	Smith (nee McKnolance) who had three children by her previous
	marriage.  It is likely that John and Ann Sara had two children of
	their own, Isabel and Bedford (not the Bedford who was in the RCMP)</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>The story is told that, when John and his new
	bride, and probably some of his stepchildren, arrived back at the
	Peters’ home after the wedding, they found the children of his
	first marriage packed and standing in the yard.  Apparently they
	moved out and did not return.  Ann Sarah (whose nickname was “Old
	Fuzzy”) was shunned by the community but continued to live there
	after Grandfather’s death.

	<h6 style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">Mildred (Beattie)
	Glendenning</h6>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>Mildred, a
	daughter of Uncle Chip Glendenning, wrote the following:</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>“<i>The
	highlight of our summer as children was a visit to Black River and a
	return surprise visit from our cousins, and as time passes, boy and
	girl friends.  During the early years, this was a weekend visit –
	a picnic lunch along the Miramichi Road between Bathurst and
	Chatham, crossing the Miramichi river by ferry, and Saturday night
	at their home.  If we were too many visitors for one house, the
	excess just went across the road to the home of Aunt Jean’s
	brother, Jim, for the night.</i></p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p><i>The
	entire home atmosphere was extremely casual – no apparent cares or
	worries, no complaints, always much laughter, happy family jokes and
	banter.  We often noticed a quantity of nicely finished lumber piled
	along the wall of the upstairs hallway and wondered why it was
	there.  Only years later was the mystery solved.  When their
	daughter, Venetia, was born, they decided that a safety rail should
	be put along the stairs and the upper hall, but it was not until the
	house was being “perked up” for her wedding reception that the
	railings were finally put in place.</i></p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p><i>Generally one family member remained behind,
	while one of our cousins came back with us to stay at least a week,
	but often longer, depending on when their family decided to pay us a
	visit.  One year, the oldest daughter, Grace, was the one to come
	back with us.  She and Clint (Mildred’s brother, Clinton – Ed.)
	enjoyed teasing and playing tricks on each other.  During her stay,
	we all enjoyed attending the annual school picnic.  This pleased her
	immensely, although the following day she didn’t feel so much like
	acting, but wouldn’t admit it was because of all the goodies
	provided – especially the ice cream cones.</i></p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p><i>On our
	way home on Sunday afternoon there was a steep hill to contend with
	as we crossed the Tabusintac River, many miles up river from where I
	eventually settled after my first marriage.  The Model T Ford was
	not equipped for climbing hills.  For one thing, the gas was
	somewhat gravity fed, but more importantly, I recently learned that
	the gears were not the same as on the cars which I have since
	learned to drive.  It seems that the gears were either forward or
	reverse, the latter providing the greater power.  Therefore, Dad
	would turn the car around, no small feat on a narrow dirt road with
	a deep ditch on either side, and ascend the hill in reverse.  What a
	thrill for children!”</i></p>
