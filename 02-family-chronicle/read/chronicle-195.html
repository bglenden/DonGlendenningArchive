<p>No. 195									October 18, 2010</p>
<p><span>____________________________________________________________________</span></p>
<p><span></span><b>New Bandon, NB</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The following notes about New Bandon were taken from an undated article by Kevin Mann, Jr.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Although the source is unknown, the font size and style reminds me of the Moncton Times Transcript and is thought to have been written about 1982.</p>
<p>Seventy families came from Bandon, Ireland to New Bandon, NB in 1816</p>
<p>Ships sailing to St. Peters, now Bathurst brought settlers and returned to Ireland with timber, especially white pine.</p>
<p>Voyages took from 4-7 weeks</p>
<p>According to the 1861 census, about 60 percent of the residents were members of the Church of England; others were primarily Presbyterian and Methodists.</p>
<p>In 1861 there were five Jago households in the New Bandon area; Jago comes from McEgo and MacKigo.</p>
<p>The Dempseys consistently distinguished themselves in battle</p>
<p>The Daley family is one of the great names in Irish literature</p>
<p>Ellis is an English Christian name but is spelled Eyls in Ulster.</p>
<p>Good and Hornibrook names existed since the sixteenth century in county Cork</p>
<p>Buttimer is also a County Cork name and comes from Boytmer in England.</p>
<p>There was one Wiseman family, Joseph, together with his wife and 6 children in the New Bandon area in the 1861 census.</p>
<p>Sealy comes from the county Cork and includes the name Shally</p>
<p>Sergeant is originally and English name.</p>
<p>Payne at one time was spelled Pine</p>
<p>The Eddys came in 1826; it was also spelled Eadie and Aidy but has also been use synonymously with Adams.</p>

<p>Many thanks to Jean (Wilson) Smith for her recent note and kind words. For the record, Jean grew up in Black River but has roots in Dumfriesshire, Scotland; we are related through the Jardines.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Jean wrote:</p>

<p><i>“Another question is the 'lancer'.   We spent many winter noon hours dancing that at MRHS, as well as at school dances,</i></p>
<p><i>probably at community dances (which I never attended), and at the "Jamboree" at the Exhibition bldg in Chatham”</i></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The lancer certainly was popular in the Miramichi; I recall going to a dances in Kouchibouguac where they danced the quadrille</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Lancers are danced by sets of four couples; each dance is made up of five figures with music unique to each figure. The lancer is thought to have developed from a military quadrille.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The main source of settlers to Black River, it seems to me, were either disbanded English or United Empire Loyalist soldiers or Scots fleeing the land clearances.  Given its origin, it could well have been of English origin – but I am not sure.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I was talking to brother, Ken, just a few days ago about itinerants in Black River.  One, Abe Napke, sold small items from a box on his wagon.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Then there were people walking from Chatham or Newcastle to their homes Bay du Vin, Hardwicke or points beyond.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Sometimes they stayed overnight on a couch in the dining room; after a hearty breakfast, they would be on their way. I've heard of people sleeping in barns but cannot recall any specific examples.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I am not aware of railroad hoboes in Chatham.  Newcastle is a more likely place since it was a junction and on the main line between Halifax and Montreal.</p>

<p><b>A Jack Knife and an Apple</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Yesterday, October 1, I sat on a bridge listening to the ripple of a brook below while enjoying the day and a picnic lunch.<b>  </b>My dessert was an apple.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>As I peeled my apple, tossing the bits of peeling into the brook below, I recalled the many times as a youngster I had tried to peel an apple in a single apple peel; not always easy but it could be done.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Of course, that also brought back memories of the jack knife, especially one with a Boy Scout logo.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Is peeling an apple in one piece is on any child’s agenda today?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If so, is doing it in one piece worthy of mention?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Then I wondered if youngsters today even aspire to owning a jack knife.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Telephone Lines</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Recently I had a note from David and Ada Dorn who are related to the Cameron and Williston families in the Miramichi.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>David mentioned a visit to Minnie (Williston) Fowlie, an Aunt, in 1974.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In giving directions to her house, Minnie said “just follow the telephone lines.” <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The NB Telephone Co. served Glenelg Parish including Black River; homes in Hardwicke Parish were served by “the Government System.” <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>George Adams, directly across the Little Branch River from my home was served by the Government system. I am not sure just how the Government lines reached Hardwicke parish – perhaps from up Bay du Vin River but, more likely, I think, from Pointe Sapin. In any case, Minnie was correct, if one followed the telephone lines through Black River they would end at the Fowlie home: telephone lines through Black R would not take one to Hardwicke.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p><b>Bottle Brushes</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Do names still have bottle brushes? Our house doesn’t.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They’ve been replaced with throw-away containers.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>No one cleans bottles anymore.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Obviously milk bottles would have been a major use for bottle brushes.</p>

Enid’s old farm had a gravel pit and she believed her Dad may have satisfied some of his Statute Labour by supplying gravel, I remember Dad found this a lovely social occasion to join other men to work on the roads. Enid also remembers porcupine quills and dogs with horror.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p><b>Donald Edge</b> remembered that his Grandfather, John W MacNaughton, kept a pitchfork with the middle tine removed--the device was used to pin down by the throat a dog that had a "quilled" nose.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
