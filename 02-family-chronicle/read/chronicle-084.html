	</p>
	<p align="justify">In
	1939, Black River was served a community Hall, four one-room schools
	(Little Branch, Middle Black River (Cameron), Upper Black River and
	Victoria), the Miramichi Rural High School at Bayside (Miramichi)
	and two churches (St. Stephen’s United and St. Paul’s
	Presbyterian).  The Community also had a community Hall and an
	active Agricultural Society, #103.</p>

	</p>
	<p align="justify">neighbour, Pete Paton, It turns
	out we have a Peters connection but we have not been able to
	establish a linkage between our families.  His Grandmother, or was
	it Great Grandmother was a Peters who married one of the Cunards
	from the Miramichi.  It is likely that, if we could go back another
	generation or two, we would find a family linkage.

	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">I am told that the Peters of New
	Brunswick came from Ireland but that the name Peters in PEI comes
	from the French “Pitre”.  I am not sure if the change was by
	accident or design.</p>
