<p><b><i>“St. John’s, New Brunswick - Tuesday, November 28, 1832<br>
<br>
My dearest, dearest wife:<br>
<br>
I write you to let you know that I take my departure from this town tomorrow morning for Eastport in the steam packet.  I arrived here last Thursday morning from Fredericton and at first engaged in a passage direct to New York in a brig.  She sailed yesterday, my friends having advised me to the contrary.  I did not go in her, and it is well, as last night there arose a most tremendous storm which still continued and she is now rocking about the Bay of Fundy, the Lord only knows where.<br>
<br>
I called on the Nashwaak as I came over but found only the old lady and John at home.  Archy was in the woods and the rest were visiting.  I wrote you from Bois’s by Willard who promised to take the key of the office which I took away by mistake and left at Nat Moer’s.  I also sent you two five pound notes by Blake who promised to deliver them through Nathaniel Sprague to you, which also remained with me thro’; mistake in my pocket book.  My dearest girl, I have ever since felt so homesick, especially among strangers, that I scarcely think of what I am doing.  Let me request of you for heaven’s sake to let yourself or our dear little ones want for nothing whatever.  I have spoken to Taylor who promised at the shortest notice to supply you with any money you may have occasion for and also, my dear, console yourself and let not my absence give you any trouble as you may depend upon my return as quick as possible.  I am very much envied, I assure you by several in the Surveyor General’s office here, especially Smith who came with me to St. John and returns back today.<br>
<br>
My dear, any wood or anything else you want to have done, Philip Ryan may haul.  Philip’s horse I sent down by Carviles with Jenkin’s furniture.  I hope therefore he has received him safe and sound as I got home.  I think if you employe his son to chop wood and see the necessary things performed about the house til I come back, you would act wisely as you certainly cannot act without some person in that capacity.  John will also, I hope, occasionally visit you as well as John (Henry).  On the whole, my dear, let me again and again conjure you for your own sake and mine to want for nothing that may contribute in any way to your comfort.  Tomorrow, with God’s help, I shall be in the United States and then, and only then, on a fair way on my journey.  I shall again write you from New York, or perhaps Boston, as I am as yet ignorant as to the route I am to take.  Archibald will want some new clothes as well as the other children, which I daresay you can get anywhere on my account.  I must say that I have received every civility here as well as in Fredericton, and my hardest thoughts are of leaving this province.  You are, however, convinced of the necessity of it and therefore will be content.<br>
<br>
You, my dearest wife, kiss our poor dear little ones for me, particularly dear little Billy.  Oh, how I long to see you all again.  I know that I am not writing like a fool, but my affections overcome me so that I cannot help it.  Poor  Eliza Ann cried most heartily at the thoughts of my going.  Tell Archibald and Prudie that if they behave well, I shall bring them something handsome from their cousins in Canada.  Give my best respects to dear Prue and tell her she must certainly write to me.  <br>
<br>
I must now conclude as I have somethings to arrange this evening.  With wish you every happiness and prosperity til it may be my good fortune once more to see your dear face and those of our dear children.  My dear, write me as early as possible.<br>
<br>
I remain my dearest girl your affectionate and never til now<br>

<br>
p.s.  I must also present the compliments of my old friend, Duke to you, who is really a most respectable and worthy person as well as his wife, who is the daughter of a Field officer in India, married and who was born in India and was well acquainted with your cousin there.  I certainly cannot forget their extreme civility.<br>
