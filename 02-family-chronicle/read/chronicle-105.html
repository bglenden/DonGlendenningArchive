	<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 0.5in">“<i>I
	have enjoyed reading through the entire series of the chronicle. I
	do remember some of the names / places mentioned – especially in
	my grandmother’s family (Maude Glendenning). My grandmother died
	in 1956 when I was only 12 years old but I do remember her. I had
	visited the family farm many years ago and remember Grandfather Jim
	Cormier sitting in his chair in the front veranda – smoking his
	pipe full of Prince Albert. Uncle Sanford and Aunt Sadie (Jagoe)
	lived on the farm at the time.</i></p>
	<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
	<p>	I can even remember people in Hamilton buying
	the wooden barrels to make “swish”. In the one chronicle you
	speak of working on the farm and stooking the wheat – a scene I
	still see often as I live in an area where there are many Mennonite
	/ Amish farmers. They do many chores which are labour intensive –
	many are still old order and

	many live without the conveniences of modern day (like hydro)”.

	<h2>Kitchen pump</h2>
	<p align="left" style="font-style: normal">For
	some reason I recalled the pump in the kitchen at home.  It was a
	“force pump” while most people had a pitcher pump.</p>
	<p align="left" style="font-style: normal"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="left" style="font-style: normal">Sometime
	after Dad purchased the place at Little Branch from Jessie
	Macdonald, he built a major addition, the piece next to the lane,
	and all of the lumber, including the hardwood floors and the pine
	pantry cupboards, was cut on the property.  At the head of the back
	stairs was a closet which was intended for a bathroom.</p>
	<p align="left" style="font-style: normal">He
	drilled a new well for the new kitchen.  Then, with an upstairs
	bathroom in mind, he purchased a “force pump” so that the water
	could be forced upstairs – presumably to a holding tank.  The pump
	was designed so that valve could be turned to prevent the water from
	coming out into the sink on the ground floor and to force the water
	to the bathroom upstairs.  There was an enlarged “bulb” which, I
	believed held air and allowed for a less “Jerkey” flow of water.</p>
	<p align="left" style="font-style: normal"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="left" style="font-style: normal">Of
	course, we never did have a bathroom upstairs until after
	electricity arrived in Black River (1948).  
	</p>
	<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="font-style: normal">On
	our first electric pump, a belt ran from small pulley on the motor
	to a large pulley/wheel on the pump.  When the electric power was
	off during a snow storm, one could turn the pump by hand to maintain
	water in the tank.  We soon found a handle off something and
	attached it to the wheel of the pump with binder twine.  Then one
	could quickly pump up a tank of water.  One cannot do that today.</p>
