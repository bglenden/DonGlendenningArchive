<p>No. 196									 <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>October 24, 2010</p>
<p><span>____________________________________________________________________</span></p>

<p><b>Typical Community Events</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span>School closings</span> – the Little Branch School, like other one-room schools, held both a Christmas and June school closing; the public was invited to both.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The school was swept and tidied up, Christmas or floral designs were stenciled on the blackboards and student names and standing by grade were also listed on the blackboard.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Then there was singing (no piano) recitations and skits organized so that every student had a role.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I imagine that Santa Claus visited although I cannot really recall it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There was fudge and Christmas candy for all.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We must have exchanged gifts but again, I do not recall and there would be a gift for teacher.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span>MRHS</span> – By 1940, there was also a Christmas concert and June graduation at the Miramichi Rural High School.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The Christmas concert usually included items from each of the 8 feeder schools plus a pageant or play by high school students.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Unlike the feeder schools, the high school had electric lights (so the function could be held at night) and a real stage with curtains.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>For the graduation, the auditorium was decorated with blueflags.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>During the morning of the gradation, the school bus would take us to an area where we picked blueflags (below Jim Cameron’s, as I recall).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Seems to me that we also had some cedar boughs.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The graduation program included a valedictorian the reading of a class will and a speaker from the community. The graduation was followed by a dance. (Would any reader have a copy of a class will?)</p>
<p><span></span><br></p>
<p><span></span><br></p>
<p><span>Harvest Home</span> – On Labour Day, St. Stephens United Church organized a festival and fund-raiser called the Harvest Home; it was first held in 1890.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>People came from miles around to enjoy the event and to meet old friends.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There were games for both young and adults and, of course, a delicious dinner, usually salmon and turkey? – and all the food was home-cooked.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>One year, at least, the program included a calf judging event.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span>Church suppers</span> – St. Paul’s, and I am sure St. Stephen’s as well, held church suppers both as a social gathering and a fundraisers. The Presbyterian one was usually held at one of the homes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Oyster stew, although a lot of work, was popular; I also remember the lemon meringue pie.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span>Tap night</span> was a bit like Halloween except one did not play tricks.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Usually one went from door to door with friends and the homeowner gave food.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Then the gang would gather at one house and eat it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Interestingly, I searched the internet and found nothing about Tap night.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It seems to me that it as held on New Year’s Eve.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span>Halloween</span> – was a young person’s night.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We went to local doors and usually received candy or an apple.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Occasionally we had firecrackers, either the kind you lighted or sometimes ones that detonated when thrown against the hard ground or side of a building.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Pranks were quite mild although occasionally an outhouse would be upset.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span>Friday night dances</span> – I went to my first dance in the Black River Hall in 1946, about a week before I graduated from High school. It was probably a Friday night since dances on Saturday night would be expected to end by midnight.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Dances were held in a number of halls and schools in the area and also at Mel Adams’ Hall in Bayside after the war.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I limited myself mostly to Friday night dances, however, my brothers would go more often.</p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><span>Arbour Day</span> – fell on May 1 and was a day for cleaning both the school building and the school yard.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That day, we took rakes, pails, scrub brushes, and likely BonAmi, to clean the windows.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We usually finished by 1:00 pm and were allowed to go home.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I recall Arbour day as quite special; on that day, Mother let me carry a lunch to school.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Although I do not literally remember, it was likely in a “five pound” Domestic Shortening can.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Lunch also included a bottle of milk (an empty vanilla bottle).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A piece of twine was tied tightly around the neck and the bottle was hung in the brook under the Miller’s Bridge.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Cold milk was quite a contrast with the milk kept cool on the basement floor (we did not have electricity at the time and, therefore, no fridge.</p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><span>Dominion Day, July 1</span> – Mother was quite patriotic.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Once a year, either Victoria Day or July 1, one or two small flags were put up at our home.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I remember the one at the corner of the verandah usually held in place by a couple of fence staples</p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Places</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><span>Bayshore</span> – most beach events were held at the Bay Shore where there was public access to the beach.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><span>Ben’s Canteen</span> – was a popular eating and meeting place in Chatham.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As I recall, people looking for a ride home would wait at Ben’s and drivers about to head home drove past Ben’s to see if anyone needed a ride.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span>Point aux Carr road</span> – was a shortcut between Black River and Point Aux Carr.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We were more frequent users, probably, because that is where Venetia and Cam lived.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span>The Forks</span> – somewhere well above Fowlie’s Mill, the Little Branch River divided; that junction was known as The Forks.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span>MacKenzie Road</span> – actually started at the Little Branch School, followed the south side of the Little Branch River and eventually joined the Richibucto Road.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>While I have not searched the matter, I understand that the MacKenzie road was the main artery between settlements on the south side of the Miramichi Bay and Richibucto, Rexton and points south.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Furthermore, at one time, there was an Inn (half way house) at the Forks, operated by a Gibson, for travellers at the Forks along the MacKenzie Road</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span>Suspension Bridge</span> – was a post war development providing a walking bridge to people on the both sides of the Eel River.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I imagine it was built initially for the benefit of school children.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span>Victory Café </span>– on Water Street near the train station in Chatham was a favourite restaurant and meeting place during WW2.</p>
