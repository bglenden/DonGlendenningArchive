	<p align="justify" style="orphans: 2; widows: 2">Readers
	will remember an earlier chronicle with a photo of Callister Hall in
	Scotland where my Great Grandfather, John Glendinning was born on
	April 2, 1807.  The latest descendant to visit Callister Hall is Joy
	Ayer, a GGGranddaughter of John Glendinning.  Joy visited on a day
	that new owners, by the name of Domoney, were moving in.  Joy has
	kept in touch and sent me a copy of a recent letter from the new
	residents.  It reads as follows:</p>
	<p align="justify" style="orphans: 2; widows: 2"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify" style="orphans: 2; widows: 2"><i><b>I
	felt, as it is now a year since we purchased Callisterhall and nine
	months sinced we moved in, that I would inform you of our progress.</b></i></p>

	</p>
	<p align="justify" style="orphans: 2; widows: 2"><i><b>We
	absolutely love it here and cannot believe how the community has
	embraced us.  Many people have said, on visiting, that it has a
	spiritual feel about the place.  </b></i>

	have spent last summer working outdoors and we are still half
	unpacked indoors, due to the lack of space, but we are now in the
	process of having a barn built  in the field next to the cottage so
	we can then &quot;expand&quot; into it.  The fields will then be
	sprayed then ploughed and re-seeded.  </b></i>

	<p align="justify" style="orphans: 2; widows: 2"><i><b>Then
	I can start with my animals.  We had 27 sheep from a local farmer
	just to graze the grass but we hope to have our own soon.</b></i></p>

	<p align="justify" style="orphans: 2; widows: 2"><i><b>We

	<p align="justify" style="orphans: 2; widows: 2"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify" style="orphans: 2; widows: 2">My
	Grandfather, Walter Glendenning, died while on a visit to Portland,
	Maine where many of his family were living.  I was not able to find
	an obituary but, thanks to the Portland Library, I found the
	following death notice which appeared  in the Portland Evening
	Express on Feb. 15, 1908:</p>
	<p align="justify" style="orphans: 2; widows: 2"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify" style="orphans: 2; widows: 2"><i><b>GLENDENNING--In
	Falmouth, Feb. 14, Walter Glendenning, aged 63  years.  Funeral
	Sunday afternoon at 2:30 o'clock, from the residence of his 
	daughter, Mrs. Doring,  Falmouth Foreside</b></i>.</p>
	<p align="justify" style="orphans: 2; widows: 2"> 
	</p>
	<p align="justify" style="orphans: 2; widows: 2">After
	my Grandfather died, Grandmother (Peters) Glendenning moved to
	Portland (Falmouth Foreside) to live with her daughter, Venetia. 
	The following death notice appeared in the Portland Evening Express
	of May 15, 1915:</p>
	<p align="justify" style="orphans: 2; widows: 2"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify" style="orphans: 2; widows: 2"><i><b>GLENDENNING--In
	Falmouth, May 14, Elizabeth P., widow of Walter Glendenning, aged 67
	years.  Funeral services Sunday afternoon at 4 o'clock, at the
	residence of her daughter Mrs. R. L. Doring, Falmouth Foreside. 
	Interment Tuesday in Canoble, N.B.</b></i></p>
	<p align="justify" style="orphans: 2; widows: 2"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify" style="orphans: 2; widows: 2">Presumably
	they are both buried in the New Bandon Cemetery - at least there is
	a stone there with both names on it.  My sister, Venetia, was born
	on the day that Grandmother Glendenning died.</p>
	<p align="justify" style="orphans: 2; widows: 2"><br />

	<p align="justify" style="orphans: 2; widows: 2"> <b>&quot;Sloven
	Case&quot;</b></p>
	<p align="justify" style="orphans: 2; widows: 2"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify" style="orphans: 2; widows: 2">Glenn
	Russell tells me that some slovens, maybe all, had rollers to ease
	loading of threshers.  He also said that sometimes a person was
	referred to as a &quot;sloven case&quot; meaning, we speculate, that
	he was not able

	<p align="justify" style="orphans: 2; widows: 2"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify" style="orphans: 2; widows: 2">to
	climb into a wagon because he had too much to drink.</p>
	<p align="justify" style="orphans: 2; widows: 2"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify" style="orphans: 2; widows: 2"><b>Transportation</b></p>
	<p align="justify" style="orphans: 2; widows: 2"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify" style="orphans: 2; widows: 2">My
	sister, Lillian, told me that Fred A.  Fowlie was the first person
	in Black River to have a car and Harrison Smith was the first in
	Bayside.  Malcolm MacNaughton may have been the third.  
	</p>
	<p align="justify" style="orphans: 2; widows: 2"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify" style="orphans: 2; widows: 2">Dr.
	MacKenzie was the first one around to have a snowmobile; he may have
	had a number over the years.  His machine, I believe, was built from
	car parts with a track on the rear and skiis on the front.  Because
	of the weight, they got stuck easily.  I recall Dr. MacKenzie's snow
	mobile stuck or broken down at the end of our lane (near where the
	concrete post is).  I've seen but do not have photos of Dr.
	MacKenzie's snowmobile at the end of our lane.</p>
	<p align="justify" style="orphans: 2; widows: 2"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify" style="orphans: 2; widows: 2">Speaking
	of Dr. MacKenzie, he would make housecalls by horse to Black River,
	and beyond.  If people needed a doctor and knew that he was down
	river, they would hang a lantern at the end of the lane so he would
	know to stop as he drove home.  Imagine the amount of time used to
	drive to Black River by horse to see a patient.</p>
