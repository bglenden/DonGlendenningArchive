	“<i>Attached are two
	letters I scanned this evening.&nbsp; The letters are from Peter
	Stewart.&nbsp; I also wanted to share with you that after my last
	email I had a reply from Helen Proudfoot to say that Peter Stewart
	was her great, great grand uncle (1812 - 1891).&nbsp; He was
	completely blind and would have dictated the letters.&nbsp; I have
	included an excerpt from Helen's email below:<br />
<br />
&quot;One
	of his eyes was destroyed by some kind of illness or infection and
	the other by an accident in childhood and there is a story of my
	great grandmother, still newly married, rushing to get him a lamp
	when she found him working in the shoemakers' workshop - and then
	being agonizingly embarrassed when her husband's uncle explained he
	could &quot;see as well in the dark as the light&quot;. <br />
<br />
&quot;He
	was a basket maker and was locally famous for his fishing flies, as
	well as composing Gaelic hymns.&quot;<br />
<br />
The post script of
	one of the letters scanned this evening states that he is not able
	to write the letters himself.<br />
</i><b><br />
I
	then sent an Email to Helen Proudfoot and below is her response:</b></p>

	<i>&quot;Ellen has sent me
	your email. In it I find you expressing an opinion which I have held
	about 90% for four or five years now. I think I might be up to 95%
	as a result of all the detail in these letters, though I still keep
	in mind that Highlanders are&nbsp;bad for talking about &quot;cousins&quot;
	when the relationship is more distant or complicated than full
	cousin. I myself sometimes&nbsp;address&nbsp;emails to Cousin Colin
	- but he is my fourth cousin.&nbsp;</i></p>

	<i>The Alexander and Peter
	who wrote these letters were&nbsp;respectively the oldest and
	&quot;youngest surviving&quot; sons of Allan Stewart who farmed at
	Stronuich and Invermearan, and who seems from the letters to have
	been tacksman of Kenknock as well. </i>

	<i>Allan of Stronuich was,
	according to my great grandfather, the son of Alexander Stewart who
	was a tenant in Milton Eonan, so this Alexander would have been
	Catherine Stewart or McNaughton's&nbsp;father if the writers and
	recipients of these letters were full cousins.&nbsp;Alexander of
	Milton&nbsp;was in turn&nbsp;one of the two known sons of Alex
	Stewart, who founded the line at Woodend, so this first Alex would
	have been Catherine's grandfather. Unfortunately&nbsp;I have no
	reliable information about&nbsp;the wives of these Alexanders, but I
	do have other information about the family if you are interested.</i></p>

	<i>My great grandfather
	Alexander Stewart was the youngest child of&nbsp;Alexander and Jean
	Stewart at Woodend, who were second cousins, descended from both
	sons of the first Alex at Woodend. Jean, my great great

	<i>The two deaths at Woodend
	described in the two most recent&nbsp;letters were of two of my
	great grandfather's older sisters, Ann and Catherine. Catherine died
	of influenza - I have the death certificate. There was an influenza
	pandemic in 1857, so the description of her death from this illness
	which Peter says &quot;commences like an ordinary cold&quot; has
	added horrible&nbsp;fascination just at the moment.</i></p>

	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">According
	to my records, Alexander MacDonald was granted Lot No. 2, 225 acres,
	on June 03, 1812 – that is the lot where Norman, Alton and Eric
	Glendenning as well as Neil Watling now live.  The property has been
	owned by Alexander’s descendants ever since.

	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Alexander
	was born in Assynt, Scotland, came to Cape Breton in 1802, spent
	some time in Point Aux Carr, and eventually settled in Little
	Branch.

	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Other
	grants awarded on the same date include Kenneth Sinclair, Angus
	Sinclair, MacLean siblings, Farquhar McRaw, Kenneth MacDonald,
	Duncan MacNaughton, Enoch Godfrey, John MacLean, Alexander Gunn,
	Robert MacBeath and John MacLeod.

	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Alexander’s
	descendants married into the Mackenzie, McKnight, MacKay, Robertson,
	Ward, Loggie, Allen, Cameron, Jardine, Watling, Fowlie, MacDiarmid,
	McGraw and Godfrey families.  Given the above, many Black River
	residents can claim him as an ancestor.</p>

	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Seems
	to me that 2012 marks an important anniversary, that of settling
