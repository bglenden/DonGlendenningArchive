  Issue 159 &middot; Jul 15, 2008
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">An exploration of the geography and history of Fox Island and other barrier islands at the mouth of the Miramichi River, including Portage, Egg, Huckleberry, Hay, and Neguac Beach islands. Don describes his father&#x27;s ownership of a marsh on Fox Island and recounts a personal anecdote about making hay there, transporting it by sled behind a Model A car to Little Branch Bridge, then by horse to the barn. The issue discusses the narrow, winding navigation channels and Don&#x27;s research into floating marshes and historical land-use practices.</div>

<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
	I
	lived for many years on the Miramichi and, while I knew that there
	were Islands at the mouth, I always thought that incoming ships and
	even fishing boats could travel most anywhere; that is not the case.
	 I am beholden to Lynn Gregan for the nautical geography lesson and
	now realize how narrow and winding the entrance channel really is.

	uninhabited </span><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barrier_island"><span lang="en"><span style="text-decoration: none">barrier
	islands</span></span></a><span lang="en">.
	The inner bay measures only 4 m deep on average, with the navigation
	channel measuring only 6-10 m. The Miramichi Bay is no longer
	dredged; therefore, the ports of Chatham and Newcastle (Miramichi)
	are only accessible to ships with a shallow draft.</span></p>
	<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
	<b>Fox
	Island,</b>
	5-6 miles in length, was probably named after the British statesman
	Charles James Fox (1749-1806). is the longest with the closest point
	being to the East of Baie Ste Anne and about a mile off shore. It
	has long been the site of commercial fishing operations.</p>

	<b>Hay

	<b>Neguac
	Beach</b>
	is a long grassy sandbar that shows up at low tide. It runs parallel
	to the north coast of the Miramichi Bay and surfaces at low tide,
	therefore adding to the barrier.</p>

	</p>
	<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
	<b>Navigation</b>
	through the Islands is limited and tricky to say the least. Large,
	commercial vessels enter through a narrow, twisting channel, perhaps
	a hundred yards wide, between Fox and Portage Islands; other
	vessels, including fishing boats, have greater, but certainly not
	unlimited, freedom to navigate.

	Donald
	Edge has pointed out that Fox Island was considered part of Glenelg
	Parish at the time of the 1851 census with at least one house/family
	at the time.</p>

	</p>
	<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
	I
	mentioned in an earlier Chronicle that my father owned a marsh on
	Fox Island; the land was used for the hay and was not cultivated.  I
	recall Walter and John, and perhaps others, going to Fox Island once
	to make hay. They brought two sled loads of hay back to Black River
	behind the old Model A car. 
	</p>
	<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
	<br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
	When
	they reached the Little Branch Bridge, they unhooked the sleds from
	the car leaving them on the flats across the river from the wharf. 
	Then they harnessed a horse, they were single sleds as I recall,
	hitched one to each sled, went up onto the road, crossed the bridge
	and landed the hay at the barn.  I remember looking across from the
	wharf to a sled on the ice near the far shore 
	</p>
	<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
	<br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
	 I
	believe that Fox Island had “floating marshes” meaning that
	although the land was privately held, the right to cut hay on a
	particular marsh rotated on a yearly basis.
