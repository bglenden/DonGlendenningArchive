<div class="reader-summary">Tenth Family Chronicle (December 1, 1999) uses Crown land grant records to document early settler families. Alexander McDonald Sr. granted Lot #2 (225 acres) June 3, 1812—property now owned by Norman Glendenning. Lists other original grantees (Sinclair, Fowlie families) with acreages and dates. References &quot;Pioneers of the Bay Chaleur&quot; showing John Glendinning purchased Lot #7 in Salmon Beach (granted to Fidele and Joseph Arceneau 1812), sold 1855 to Abram Buttimer, and received Canobie land grant 1868. Documents land grants to Glendenning males: John Glendinning Jr. (Canobie, Lot #31, August 17, 1868), Walter Glendenning (Canobie, Lot #30, February 17, 1873), Atton E. Glendenning (Canobie, Lot #28, July 6, 1901). Notes unusual practice: settlers often occupied land years before receiving title. Mentions FWH&#x27;s &quot;Boyhood Memories of New Brunswick&quot; (c. 1940) manuscript at Mount Allison University describing Canobie life. Queries about Miller&#x27;s Bridge origin and other local place names.</div>

<p>Cameron MacDonald pointed out that the headstone in the Black River Cemetery belonging to William and Margaret Godfrey includes the following <span>A</span>John William, infant son of Kenneth and Katherine MacDonald<span>@</span>.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That would result in the Ken MacDonald family being as follows:</p>

<p><b>FWH</b><b></b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>In the Bell Holdings at Mount Allison University, I found <span>Boyhood Memories of new Brunswick</span>, written by FWH about 1940.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is a typewritten manuscript rather than a book and is about his boyhood memories in Canobie.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Among other things, he mentions:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>an Uncle who was a Stevens and another who was a Knowles.</p>
<p>he was born in Clifton, near the stone quarry.</p>
<p>his grandparents lived in Newcastle during the Miramichi Fire (1825)</p>
<p>Tim Savage was a near neighbour. (Lot #27 in Canobie was owned by Tim Savage.)</p>
<p>his mother was a school teacher who received $200 from the government nd $200 from the district.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>He also tells a ghost story based at a camp in the woods just south of Bathurst on the <span>A</span>Red Pine Section of the Intercolonial Railroad<span>@</span>.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>From what he said, his mother was at that camp.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He ends his manuscript with his departure from Bathurst for Maine.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>It is likely that he was a Henry, grandson of Mary Anne Harley and John Henry.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I do not have the names of many of her family but understand that her husband, John, died in 1870 an she moved to Portland shortly thereafter.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My records also show that one of Mary Anne<span>=</span>s daughters married a Knowles and another married a Stevens.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Land Grants</b><b></b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The Department of Natural Resources, Fredericton has maps showing the first owners of land granted by the Crown.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They also have a book listing all the original owners.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Information in the book and maps should be the same, but isn<span>=</span>t always.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The following information was gleaned from these sources.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Alexander McDonald Sr. (not MacDonald) was granted Lot #2, 225 acres, on 1812-06-03. This is the property now owned by Norman Glendenning.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>On the same date and further up the Branch</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Kenneth Sinclair was granted Lot #3 with 220 acres.</p>
<p>Angus Sinclair was granted Lots 4 &amp; 5 with 410 acres.</p>
<p>Alexander McDonald (the book says Sr. but the map shows Jr.) was granted Lot #6 consisting of 140 acres.</p>
<p>The next land was granted to George Fowlie but numbers and boundaries are not clear to me.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The west side of the Alexander McDonald property forms the rear line of the following properties:</p>
<p>Lot A - Enoch Godfrey</p>
<p>Lots # 1, 2 &amp; 3 - John McLean</p>
<p>Lot #4 - Alexander Gunn</p>
<p>Lot #5 - Robert MacBeath</p>
<p>Lot #6 - John MacLeod</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>On 1936-09-16, Elmer Glendenning was granted 100 acres, Lot #7s.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This would be John<span>=</span>s woodlot.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The front half of this property was owned by Thomas Patterson.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Jubal Watling, Jr. was granted Lot #30, 100 acres, on the south side of Black River on 1881-04-20.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Next to Jubal, towards the highway, were Gardiner Archibald, Lot #29, granted in 1880-05-10 and Richard Hutchison, Lot #28, granted in 1849-0604.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Next to Jubal, up river, was Donald Cameron on Lot #31 granted in 1854-01-30.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Canobie</b><b></b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I cannot find any original grant to John Glendinning therefore, he must have purchased from someone else. <span>A</span>Pioneers of the Bay Chaleur<span>@</span> says he bought part of Lot #7 in Salmon beach; this land was granted originally to Fidele and Joseph Arceneau in 1812-06-01.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The<span>@</span>Pioneer Book<span>@</span> also says that John Glendinning sold his land in 1855 in Salmon Beach to Abram Buttimer and was granted land in Canobie in 1868</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Lot #31, 100 acres, in Canobie was granted to John Glendinning, Jr. in 1868-08-17 so it appears that the property was put in the son<span>=</span>s name.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>It was not unusual for early settlers to live on land for a number of years before receiving title;<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>they may have even been required to clear a number of acres and even build a house.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Lot #30, 100 acres, in Canobie was granted to Water Glendinning in 1873-02-17.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Lot #28, 100 acres, was granted to Atton E. Glendenning on 1901-07-06.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Would this be, Dad, Alton E. Glendenning?</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The lots in the area were as follows:</p>
<p>Lot #36 - Norman Peters</p>
<p>Lot #35 (E) - Norman Peters</p>
<p>Lot #35 (W) - F.W. Ellis</p>
<p>Lot #34<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>- John Jagoe</p>
<p>Lot #33 - J. McCarthy, Jr.</p>
<p>Lot #32 - J. McCarthy, Jr.</p>
<p>Lot #31 - John Glendinning, Jr.</p>
<p>Lot #30 - Walter Glendinning</p>
<p>Lot #29 - H. Knowles</p>
<p>Lot #28 - E. Glendenning</p>
<p>Lot #27 - Timothy Savage</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Other Questions</b><b></b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The bridge at the foot of the hill at Norman<span>=</span>s is known as the Millers Bridge.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>What is the origin of the name?</p>
