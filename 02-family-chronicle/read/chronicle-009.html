<p>Walter Glendenning was born Sept 29, 1913 not Sept. 23 as given in the last Family Chronicle.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My records were correct but I copied it incorrectly.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Sorry.</p>

<p><b>An Added Focus</b><b></b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>While I will continue to search for family connections and dates, I plan to devote more attention to family members, family activities<b> </b>and even favourite family stories.<b><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span></b>While I hope to be accurate, readers must remember two things.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>First, I was the youngest of the family and much of what I write would have come to me second hand; Second, we remember selectively. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>One<span>=</span>s memory of yesterday may not always be accurate; it is likely, therefore, some of the dates, names, persons or places will be incorrect.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I ask readers to let me have corrections or at least their versions of the event.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p><b>Jeanette Watling</b><b></b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I was browsing the LDS database on the internet recently and came across the name of Jeanette Nickolson Watling who was born on May 28, 1852 in Napan, NB.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She married in Dover, Mass. But we do not know her husbands name.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Her father was John Watling and mother was Jessie Carruthers.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Adams</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>I also found information about Uncle Tom Adams.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He was one of 10 children of James Adams and Ellen Farish; all were born in</p>
<p><br></p>

<p>Margate, PEI.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Sometime after 1880 Tom, his father and mother and his brothers George (who lived across the Little Branch River from Norman Glendenning)<b> </b>and Jonathon moved to Little Branch.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Tom and Aunt Tine were married on August 17, 1895; Tom died on Sept. 29, 1902; they had three children Gertrude, Willard and James. (Aunt Tine married John MacKenzie in August, 1907) I remember someone saying that George Adams travelled one time to PEI by horse and wagon to visit relatives.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Alexander MacDonald Property</b><b></b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The following was taken from the book by A. W. MacDougall.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span>A</span>Alexander MacDonald came from the Highlands with the 1803 immigration.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He settled on Lot #3 of the Third Division, on the west side of the southwest branch of Black River...</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>It has been told of the elder Mr MacDonald , that when the Government Surveyors were allotting the land to the prospective settlers, he was told to proceed along the shore till he had secured a sufficient frontage for his lot, the surveying party following him downstream in a canoe.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Land being plentiful, Mr. MacDonald decided to secure as large a grant as possible.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>After he had gone a considerable distance, his further progress was barred by a creek, but he plunged in and waded across, only to be brought to a halt on the other side by the government men, who considered that he had already acquired sufficient.<span>@</span><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>(Would this be Miller<span>=</span>s Brook?)</p>
<p>I have not searched the titles but believe that the Alexander MacDonald property would be the properties now owned by Norman Glendenning I have not searched the titles but believe that the Alexander Macdonald lproperty would be the properties now owned by Norman Glendenning and Neil Watling. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I do not know, but it is likely that the Alexander MacDonald home was located above the home now occupied by Norman Glendenning.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There was a depression, like that from an old basement, near the orchard.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Since the Little Branch River provided transportation, it would make sense to be close to the water.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Lillian recalls old lumber piled in the field roughly in that area.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is possible, however, that the house was actually in the next field above the orchard (Uncle Jim<span>=</span>s field).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>At one time there was a pump in this field.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>If I<span>=</span>m correct, half the property was given to or purchased by his son John and the other half passed to or was purchased by daughter, Jessie (1823-1912).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Dad bought Jessie<span>=</span>s property in 1912.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The John MacDonald property passed to Jubal and Grace (MacDonald) Watling.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They moved from Upper Black River (above MacBeath<span>=</span>s Bridge) to the Branch to look after John and/or Elspeth (Jardine) MacDonald and were given the property in return. (Believed to be before 19030.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As I further understand it, Jubal left the property to sons James and Ernest; later Ernest sold his share to James (Uncle Jim)</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>A Close Call</b><b></b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>It was Christmas of 1938, the year Dad died; Lillian came home from Boston where she was working.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Walter was driving the Model A taking us to shop in Chatham.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In those days, one always travelled via Loggieville on the way to Chatham.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Walter was driving, Mum was in the front passenger seat, I was in the middle.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In the back seat were Ken, Norm and Lillian.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>John and Elinor were home; Grace was married and living in Boston, Venetia was married and living in Point Aux Carr.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The front right window in the Model A was broken; it was a clear cold day and the window had been replaced with a piece of cardboard.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Between Loggieville and Chatham, we caught up to a brownish truck with a wooden box belonging to George Adams Sr. ( Or would it have been Jesse or Tommie Adams?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There were some people riding on the back of the truck but I cannot recall who.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Just as we reached the railway crossing, we heard a train whistle; a train was bearing down on us from the right on its way from Chatham to Loggieville.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Applying the brakes would likely mean sliding right on to the tracks in front of the train; Walter pushed the gas pedal to the floor and we just crossed the tracks when the train whistled across the road behind us.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was a close call. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Later in Chatham, someone from the back of the Adams<span>=</span> truck said that they were so certain that the train was going to hit us that they put their head down so as not to witness the crash.</p>
