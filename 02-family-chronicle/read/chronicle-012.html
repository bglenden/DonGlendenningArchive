<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>There were over 600,000 Canadians overseas during WW1.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Most served in the Canadian Expeditionary Force; many served in the British army.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The Canadian Archives has developed a database of most but not all of the names.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>For anyone wishing to search, the web site is </b><span><b>A</b></span><b>www.archives.ca</b><span><b>@</b></span><b><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A search revealed 10 Glendennings including (Uncle) Guy Wellington Glendenning (Regimental Number 445210) and (Aunt) Margaret Violet Glendenning (No Regimental Number - she was a nurse) There also were 16 Glendinnings. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>There were 21 Watlings including (Uncle) Donald Ernest Watling.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>(#70039) The other Watlings which could have been related include Archie (#46798), George Maxwell (#901129), William Jubal (#832788)</b></p>

<p><b>Home Children</b><b></b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>The Home Children listed on the Internet include 1 Glendenning and 5 Watlings.</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Another uncle?</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>My search of the NB Archives turned up a Walter Glendenning born April 19, 1881 to Walter Glendenning and Elizabeth Peters.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>At first I thought that Dad had another brother, however, the month and year, but not the date, matches that of Uncle Leonard.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My conclusion is that either someone copied the names and dates incorrectly, that they had trouble deciding on a name, or that they actually named him Walter and changed the name later.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b><b></b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Refrigeration</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Some time ago I told you my story about our new refrigerator; more recently, Loisanne mentioned getting a new fridge. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Refrigeration at home, as I remember it, was the basement floor.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Butter and milk were kept in the basement; the butter in a crock and the milk, probably in a shortening bucket with a lid and presumably cream for our strawberries..<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Inevitably, or so it seemed to me, I was the one who had to go down to the basement for the milk and butter.</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>It seems to me that one year , perhaps more, we had ice in what was or became the henhouse.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>One would scrape away a bit of the sawdust and put things on the ice.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I remember that George Adams, who ran the store across the river from Norman</b><span><b>=</b></span><b>s, seemed always to have ice and stored perishables there.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The only things I can ever remember buying at Adams</b><span><b>@</b></span><b> store was bologna and </b><span><b>A</b></span><b>Muskrat</b><span><b>@</b></span><b> juice.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The latter was really Monserrat (an Island in the Carribean) lime juice which we mixed with water and a bit of sugar.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We drank gallons of it at haying time.</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Later probably John or Walter sunk a barrel in the brook just above the Miller</b><span><b>=</b></span><b>s Bridge and we kept a five-gallon cream can there.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We placed stones on the cover of the barrel to keep the cream can down.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Each day after milking and separating, we took the fresh cream down and added it to the can.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When someone came to pick up the cream (was it a Dick ?)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The cream can, now nearly full, became very heavy to carry up to the road to load on the wagon.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Normally, we came home for lunch with the school being so close.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Arbour Day, however, was one day that Mum let me take a lunch.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I do not remember much about the lunch but I do remember that it included a bottle of milk; as I recall it was a large vanilla bottle.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We tied a string around the neck of the bottle and placed it in the brook under the Miller</b><span><b>=</b></span><b>s Bridge.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It sure tasted good.</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>By the way, I still wonder about the origin of the name </b><span><b>A</b></span><b>Miller</b><span><b>@</b></span><b>s</b><span><b>@</b></span><b> Bridge.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Is the brook known as Miller</b><span><b>=</b></span><b>s Brook?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Just wondering.</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Wartime radio messages</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><span><b>A</b></span><b>Attention all lighthouse keepers in the East Coast Area, instructions </b><span><b>&gt;</b></span><b>A</b><span><b>=</b></span><b>, </b><span><b>&gt;</b></span><b>A</b><span><b>=</b></span><b> is for apple, are to be carried out.</b><span><b>@</b></span><b><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Many a time this message was heard over our radios.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Obviously it was a code; what it meant, I was never sure but I believe that it had something to do with the movement of ships in or out of port; it could also have meant the movement of vessels along the coast. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b>I often wondered what action was required as a result of that message.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We know that enemy submarines sank ships in the St Lawrence River and operated generally in the Gulf.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Some may have even entered the Miramichi Bay but I have not read any reports to confirm this.</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>A spy in Black River?</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>The Ken MacDonald house stood where Cameron MacDonald now has his home.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was a large, weather beaten, one and one-half story house; it remained vacant, as I recall, except for each summer when the MacDonald sisters returned from Portland.</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Early during WW2, a stranger appeared in the community and took up residence in the Ken MacDonald house.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The name, as I recall, was Tom Coll; he was an Englishman.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I believe that he was married but they kept pretty much to themselves although I do recall him coming to our house.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>After the war, he disappeared; I have no idea where he came from or where he went.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He had a pair of wooded skis and travelled across the fields in winter.</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>We, children, thought this to be myster- ious and wondered if he was a spy.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I</b><span><b>=</b></span><b>d be interested in knowing the real story.</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>War Savings Stamps</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>People were encouraged to purchase War Savings Bonds to help with the war effort.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There were also war savings stamps valued at 25 cents each. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Because we were one of the few places to have a telephone, we frequently ended up delivering messages to neighbours including Alex MacDonald who, as I recall, operated a dredge for a company from Buctouche. (Was the owner a Michaud?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Was he a Senator? I don</b><span><b>=</b></span><b>t know.)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Mum negotiated an arrangement with Michaud to send me two stamps each time I delivered a message.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I remember the stamps arriving in the mail and putting them in my savings book.</b></p>
