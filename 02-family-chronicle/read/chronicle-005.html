<div class="reader-summary">Fifth Family Chronicle (October 31, 1998) analyzes Don&#x27;s mother&#x27;s autograph album, dating entries from 1910-1915. First entry: mother Jane Watling Glendenning, Portland Maine, December 1, 1910. Earliest entry by Don&#x27;s father E. A. Glendenning from Wausau, Wisconsin, September 18, 1910 (before their marriage). Describes their wedding in New Brunswick October 18, 1910, followed by December 1910 Christmas entries in Bonny Eagle, Maine, and February 11, 1911 in Parksville, Tennessee (dam construction). Documents entries from family and friends from various locations including Tennessee, Nova Scotia, and Maine. Notes interesting entries by Uncle Guy Glendenning (1915, between enlistment dates) and mentions mysterious references to Pine Point and other southern locations. Shows Don&#x27;s mother maintained a rich social circle during early married years.</div>

<p>	<b>The Family</b> <b>Chronicle</b><b></b></p>
<p>No.5									<span class="Apple-converted-space">          </span>1998 10 31</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span></span></p>
<p>Recently, I reviewed Mum<span>=</span>s Autograph Album. Many of the pages are loose and some may be missing, however, here are some observations based on the<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>entries we have:</p>
<p>The entry on the first page reads as follows:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Dear Friends:</p>
<p>My album<span><i>=</i></span>s open.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Come and see.</p>
<p>What! Won<span><i>=</i></span>t you waste a line on me?</p>
<p>Write but a line, a work or two</p>
<p>That memory may revert to you<b>.</b><b></b></p>
<p>J. Watling Glendenning</p>
<p>Portland, Maine</p>
<p>December 1<sup>st</sup>, 1910</p>
<p>Bonny eagle, Maine</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I am puzzled to find this entry later in the album:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I have looked these pages ore and ore</p>
<p>And seen what others wrote before</p>
<p>And in looking in one lovely spot</p>
<p>I see in scribble forget me not.</p>
<p>E. A. Glendenning</p>
<p>Wasau, Wisc.</p>
<p>Sept 18th/10</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>This is the earliest dated entry in the album, and was dated before Mum and Dad were married.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My guess is that Dad gave Mum the album when he returned to Portland from Wasau, Wisconsin.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Later in the album, I find this entry:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Around went the album</p>
<p>and hither it came</p>
<p>for me to write in So here is my name.</p>
<p>E.A. Glendenning</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Portland, Me.</p>
<p>Nov 6th/10</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>This would have been shortly after they returned from their wedding in New Brunswick.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There are no other entries on that date.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>There were a number of entries on December 28, 1910.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They may have had a few friends in during the holidays especially because they were leaving shortly for work in Tennessee.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The entries on this date are by Amy B. Usher, Alta M. Usher, LaMont C. Usher all of Bonny Eagle, Maine.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In a book where Mum recorded<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>the purchase of wood, the name<span>@</span>Preston Usher<span>@</span> appears but he was not at the party or, if he was, he did not sign the autograph album.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>There is an entry on that date also by Margaret Glendenning, Dad<span>=</span>s sister, who gave her address as Falmouth Foreside, Maine.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>At the bottom of the page she wrote <span>A</span>So. Portland High School<span>@</span> Aunt Margaret would have been 17 years old at the time.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I believe that Falmouth Foreside is where Aunt Venetia Doring lived.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is a bit north of Portland near Freeport (now famous for its outlet stores).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Bonny Eagle, on the other hand, was on the south west side of Portland and a few miles outside the city near, I believe, Sebago Lake where Uncle Frank had his cottage property.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Could Aunt Margaret have gone to Bonny Eagle to Spend a few days with Dad and Mum over the Christmas holiday?</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>On January 2, 1911, Gladyce Pearle Beane of Readfield, Maine signed the album; then there is an entry, undated, by Willis Sawer of West Buxton.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>On January 31, Leola S. Blake, Buxton Ctr.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>signed the album.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>It looks as thought the Album was then packed for the journey to Parksville, Tennessee where Dad worked on the first of three dams on the Ocoee River.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Mum noted in another book that she <span>@</span>Commenced housekeeping, Parksville, Tennessee, Feb. 11<sup>th,</sup> 1911".</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>On April 27, 1911 , there is an entry by Mrs Stanley Franke and Miss Mae Franke.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They give their addresses as Pleasant River, Queens Co. Nova Scotia. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>There are a number of entries from Parksville, Tennessee dated October 13, 1911.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>One is by Florence Davis.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The second entry is by <span>A</span>JDW<span>@</span>.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I wonder if it is a Watling but cannot think of who it would be.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Also on that date we find:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Parksville, Tenn</p>
<p>Oct 13/11</p>
<p>Dear sister Janie:</p>
<p>Be thine: the true flower of a blameless life.</p>
<p>Yours lovingly</p>
<p>Janet</p>
<p>Little Branch North<span><i>=</i></span>d Co</p>
<p>N.B., Canada</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>We know that Aunt Janet went to Parksville when Grace was born, September 23, 1911.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Then there is an undated entry from Goforth Creek, Camp #2 from Goldie Ratcliffe (later Goldie Kennedy), a life-long friend.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Two entries appear on November 13, 1912</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Goforth Creek,</p>
<p>Parksville, Tenn</p>
<p>Dear Sister</p>
<p>May your life be like the snowflake which leaves a mark but not a stain.</p>
<p>D. Ernest Watling</p>
<p>Little Branch, N.B.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>And</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Away back here and out of sight</p>
<p>I<span><i>=</i></span>ll write my name down</p>
<p>Just for spite.</p>
<p>Hughy</p>
<p>Kenny<span><i>=</i></span>s Hill<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Hugh MacDonald , Known as <span>A</span>Mac<span>@</span> was killed while working on the Newcastle (Morrissy) Bridge.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>On June 27/13, M.J. Miller of River Louison, Rest. Co. N.B. entered a verse.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The last entry follows:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Little Branch</p>
<p>July 9, 1915</p>
<p>This book went round and here it came.</p>
<p>In it for me to write my name.</p>
<p>I would write better if I could</p>
<p>But nature said I never should.</p>
<p>Guy W. Glendenning</p>
<p>Canobie, N.B.</p>
<p>Portland, Maine</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>This is interesting because of the three addresses and because it occurred between the date Uncle Guy enlisted (Bathurst, July 2, 1913) and the date he was inducted at Sussex, July 14, 1915.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Mum would have been home when Venetia was born, May 14, 1915.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Perhaps Dad was in N.B. at that time also.</p>
