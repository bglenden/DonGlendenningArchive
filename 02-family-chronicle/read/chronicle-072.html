	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>The forker
	arrangement was quite simple but effective.  Two hooks, like ice
	tongs, were used to fasten pulleys to rafters.  The forkful of hay
	rose almost straight up and locked into a carrier which carried the
	hay sideways over the mow before being dropped.  The hooks in the
	rafters could be changed with the aid of a long, slim pole, the
	forker pole, to allow the hay to go either right or left – to the
	mow or to the loft.  Another pulley was fastened near the ground
	where the horse was used to raise the load.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>Donald Edge remembers
	riding up to the rafters on a bare hay fork then dropping to the hay
	in the mow below.  He also noted that the Miramichi fire of 1825
	devastated Little Branch but that the remainder of Black River was
	quite unscathed.  Donald and Vera Watling, and Earl and Mary Edge,
	used to camp and picnic at the Meadows.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>Art Mills
	added the following information about the original Mills grant in
	Hardwicke:  
	</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>“<i>The
	land grant is in original form including part of the Kings seal
	(wax).  </i>
	</p>
	<p><i>Uncle
	Andrew Mills held this document until his death. The seal is
	currently 3&quot; by 1.5&quot;; it was round.  Uncle Andrew
	explained &quot;when the family had a very important letter to send,
	they would cut off some of this fine wax to seal &quot;thus the
	strange shape and smaller size”.    </i>
