<p><b>The Family</b> <b>Chronicle</b><b></b></p>
<p>No. 56										 <span class="Apple-converted-space">      </span>December 22, 2003</p>
<p><span><span class="Apple-converted-space">                                                                                                                                 </span>________________</span><span></span></p>
<p><b>Miramichi Visit</b><b></b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I made these notes while on my annual pre-winter visit to the Miramichi; it was a busy four days.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I arrived about noon on Thursday and went back to PEI on Sunday morning.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>While there I spoke to the Chatham Rotary Club about the establishment of a comm-unity foundation.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I stayed with Ken and Verne.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I am interested in all the early settlers of Black River even though they may not be ancestors.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I still have many gaps but Ernie MacLean provided me with background on the MacLean families.<span class="Apple-converted-space">     </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Ken and I made a trip to the Bathurst area to visit relatives including Guy Glendenning who I mentioned in an earlier newsletter.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Also stopped at the New Bandon Cemetery where my grandfather, Walter, and his wife, Elizabeth Peters, are buried.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Also buried in the New Bandon Cemetery are Grand-father’s brother, John and John’s wife Ellen Dickey.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I have not been able to find where my Great Grandfather and Grandmother, John and Margaret Glendinning, are buried.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Also had a brief visit with Marion Glendenning and Carson Daley.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>So it was a good day although a couple of others we normally visit were not at home when we stopped by.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Had a visit with Sandra (Taylor) Shea on the way home.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Of course, I had a visit with Norm and Jean and family a couple of times and everywhere I go I try to pursue my interests in genealogy.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Marjorie Young also filled in some gaps.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Neighbours</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>With Ken and Norm’s help, I am trying to recall the neighbours in Black River when I was young – say the early 1940’s but I will save the results of our discussion for a later Chronicle.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Slovens</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>A couple of times in the past month mention was made of a sloven.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>George Adams who lived across the river from us owned the only one that I can recall in Black River.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A sloven is a farm wagon with large wheels like any truck wagon but with axles slung low to the ground.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The platform was about 12-18 inches off the ground as I recall.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Slovens were used, I am told, to move large barrels and puncheons and were great for hauling heavy items, such as a thresher, because of the platform being low to the ground. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I asked my cousin, Guy Glendenning in Canobie and he recalled one in the community when he was young.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I found since that the Monaghan Company manufactured slovens on Prince Edward Island.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In fact an Island friend thought that slovens may have been “invented” in Prince Edward Island.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>George Adams who had owned the one in Black River had come to Black River from PEI so maybe his was manufactured there.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I’ll keep you posted if I learn anymore.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Horse Scoop</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>No, a horse scoop is not a pooper-scooper that people carried around to pick up after<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>horses.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Horses generally had the freedom to poop whenever and wherever they wanted.</p>
<p>I was reminded of this subject because Ken and I saw a scoop on the side of the lane leading to the New Bandon cemetery. <span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>A horse scoop was shaped a bit like a large snow shovel or sugar scoop.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was used when moving dirt around an excavation.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Walter used it, for example, when he excavated the basement for his home on the Dan MacLean property.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The scoop had two handles projecting from the rear so that a person could stand between them and lift the back of the scoop.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was pulled by a horse and when on the level could move dirt quite easily.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When you wanted to load it, you simply lifted the handles a bit so that the mouth of the scoop would dig into the ground.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When the shovel was full, the horse dragged it to another location and you lifted the handles again.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This time the mouth of the scoop dug in and upset the load leaving an empty scoop ready for another load.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>A Near-fire</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Ken and I were recalling a near fire at home, I am not sure of the year.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As I recall, Ken, Norm and I were hauling wood one spring day, although there was still lots of snow around.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We were hauling the wood on a large hand-sled, John’s sled we always called it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Ken smelled smoke and was met by smoke when he opened the cellar door.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>At our place, the furnace firebox was set inside a brick box about 5’x5’ x5’.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Another brick wall was built outside the first leaving an air space between the two walls of brick acted as an insulator.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The furnace itself would handle a stick of wood four feet long.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Forming a cap over the furnace was a sheet metal covering with a number of openings to which pipes could be attached to lead the warm air to various rooms above.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>On top of the sheet metal was a layer of sand to also act as insulation.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Seems that the cats were playing on the sand on top of the furnace and pushed off one of the covers.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>At the same time, the cast iron furnace had cracked allowing flames to enter the chamber.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Something caught fire. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>As I recall, Ken came to the rescue and quickly got pails of water to douse the fire.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>It was shortly thereafter, as I recall, they replaced the cast iron furnace.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was very heavy and they used a rope to hold it back when sliding it down the cellar stairs.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Norman MacKenzie, who was a big, husky man, helped Walter and John ease the furnace down to the basement and replace the old one.</p>

<p><b>Arbour Day<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Arbour Day was always special.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was a day to clean the school and yard and we always got “out” early.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was also one of the few occasions when I was able to take a lunch to school.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Normally, because we lived so close to the school, I went home for lunch.</p>
