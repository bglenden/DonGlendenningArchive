<div class="reader-summary">Fundraising letter from Don Glendenning soliciting donations for the Citizen&#x27;s Math project through Community Foundation of PEI. Explains that Education 20/20&#x27;s innovative approach starts with surveying math skills needed in daily life rather than traditional curriculum development. Notes the $15,000 project cost with half for facilitator fees, the rest for analysis and local support. References that most people capable of leading such analysis have retired or moved away, demonstrating Don&#x27;s resourcefulness in bringing in Meg Savory from British Columbia. Shows his vision of practical math education and commitment to educational innovation in PEI.</div>

<p>Dear</p>
<p><b>MATH FOR EVERY-DAY LIVING</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>Curriculum development normally starts with an analysis of the subject under study; Education 20/20 believes that, instead, it should start by making a survey of math skills needed in every-day life.<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>This model engages learners early in the application of math to solving life’s daily prob0erms. It asks the question “how much math do you need to be a good citizen?”.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Education 20/20 Inc. proposes to ask Islanders just that question.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Education 20/20 proposes to convene a local group of citizens from various walks of life to undertake such a survey.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The process is widely used and usually involves 10 or so people working over a two- day period with an experienced facilitator. Life tasks or competencies are identified and organize in the form of a chart or map.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Islanders associated with Holland College may be familiar with such documents.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>While we cannot guarantee that these maps<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>will be adopted by the education system, math maps will be useful to parents and students, teachers and employers in counselling, career planning, defining standards, determining qualifications and as a tool for life-long learning. Tracking student progress</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>It’s a $15,000 project, half of which will for an experienced facilitator. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>$8, 000 to consultants to lead the analysis process and the rest for local support including facilities, meeting costs, printing, graphics, and consultation. Whereas at one time there were a half-dozen people on PEI who could lead such an analysis, all seem to have retired or moved away.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I am still looking but, in the meantime, I found someone living in British Columbia, still practicing and willing to come to PEI to lead the analysis process. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><span><b>BUT WE NEED</b></span><span><b> </b></span><span><b>HELP TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN, FINANCIAL HELP. THAT IS.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></span> We have opened an account at the Community Foundation of Prince Edward Island and are seeking contributions; donations are eligible for a chartable receipt and cheques should be made payable to the Community Foundation of Prince Edward Island, Suite 102, 119 Queen Street, Charlottetown, PEI, C1A 4B3; you can also contribute through <span>Canada Helps. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p><span></span><br></p>
<p>While I cannot guarantee that the map will be used by the education system, but it will at least provide further information to the education debate. Based on my search, it will also be the only custom built analysis for the purpose.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I’ll be back in touch in a few days to explain the idea further and answer any questions.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Don Glendenning, President</p>
<p>Education 20/20 Inc,</p>
