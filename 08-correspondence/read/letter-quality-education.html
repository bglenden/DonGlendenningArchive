</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Philosophical letter defining quality education through UNICEF criteria (healthy learners, safe environments, relevant content, learner-centered processes, outcomes including attitudes/skills/knowledge). Don situates education as support for the &quot;road of life&quot; journey and argues these criteria reflect community concerns better than standardized test results alone. Advocates supplementing PISA/PCAP with broader quality measures.</div>

<p>Dear Editor:	</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>A Quality Education</b><b></b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The road of life is a way of describing our journey between birth and death, and education provides help as we travel.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Help comes in many forms and from many people and its focus is on increasing and improving the knowledge, skills and attitudes needed to meet challenges along the way.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As a result, our quality of life will depend, to a large degree, on the quality of education that we experience. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>In 2000, UNICEF identified the characteristics of a quality education as one with:</p>
<p>Learners who are healthy</p>
<p>Environments that are healthy and safe</p>
<p>Content that is relevant</p>
<p>Processes that are learner centered</p>
<p>Outcomes that include attitudes, skills and knowledge</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>It seems to me that these are a good reflection of community concerns, lend themselves to large scale assessment, would give us a broader view of quality in our schools and be a welcome supplement the results of PISA, PCAP and school tests.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
