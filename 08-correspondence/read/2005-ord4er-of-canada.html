<p>Dear Ms Barton:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I am delighted to add my support to the name of Wade MacLaughlin for membership in the Order of Canada.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I have known the MacLaughlin family for many years and they were and are well established and respected on Prince Edward Island.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I got to know Wade first as Dean of Law at the University of New Brunswick and later when he became President of the University of Prince Edward Island. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The appointment of Wade MacLaughlin as President of UPEI was well received in the Island community.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He exudes warmth, is both articulate and commanding, and has a significant media presence..</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Under his Presidency, the University has certainly strengthened its community liaison, has expanded its offerings and has greatly added to specialized facilities and research.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The Senior’s College, although not initiated by Wade, has expanded significantly and is certainly is a highly recognized and valued services to the community.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>His appointment to the Order of Canada would not be surprising and would be well received.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I certainly support it.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
<p><br></p>
