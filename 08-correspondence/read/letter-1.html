<div class="reader-summary">Letter from Don Glendenning to David Cadogan discussing governance and tax implications of the Cadogan Foundation&#x27;s relationship with CFPEI. Demonstrates Don&#x27;s expertise in charitable law, CRA interpretation, and his hands-on involvement in foundation governance decisions.</div>

<div class="reader-content">
<p>Mr. David Cadogan</p>
<p>PO Box 397</p>
<p>Miramichi, NB</p>
<p>E1N 3A8</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Dear David:</p>
<p><span>Cadogan Foundation</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>This is a follow-up to our recent telephone conversation about community foundations generally and the possibility of a “home” for the Cadogan Foundation within the Community Foundation of Prince Edward Island.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>First of all, I apologize for the long delay in responding to your questions.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The idea of direct delivery was not on our radar screen as such.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>On only one or two occasions that I recall, did we have to make arrangements with a “qualified donee” to supervise a grant to an organization that itself was not a qualified donee.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In addition, we have been asked a number of times recently about writing receipts for fund raisers in which the charitable component of a contribution may accrue to the benefit of an organization not considered a qualified donee by CCRA... <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>At our most recent board meeting, our Board decided that it will only issue receipts for the charitable portion of a fund raiser if the proceeds are to be credited to an endowment we now administer.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I have had a number of discussions with CRA about community foundations also being a direct deliverers of charitable services; this does not present a problem to CRA provided the letters patent allow for it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If there is a doubt about a foundation’s ability to direct deliver, a letter can be directed to CRA and they will give an interpretation.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Community foundations of Canada, however, are not keen on the idea although, I am told, that a few community foundations do exercise this prerogative.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In any case, our Board decided not to pursue the issue at this time. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>During my discussions with CRA, I raised the matter of an award to an individual that was not a scholarship.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Again, CRA has no objection in principle provided that our letters patent allow us to do it, the process is an open one and the population to which it applies is not too narrowly defined.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I would be quite prepared to seek a CRA interpretation if needed.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>At our most recent board meeting, I raised the issue of CFPEI administering the Cadogan Foundation; our Board would be most open to the idea.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There are a number of possible arrangements; each is explained briefly below:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>A <b>Managed Fund </b>under which a charitable organization places funds with us primarily for investment purposes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Managed funds are owned by the charitable organization and may be withdrawn in whole or in part at any time.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Under this scenario, the Cadogan Foundation would withdraw funds annually and make its own decisions as to grants including the issuance of cheques.</p>
<p>An <b>Agency Fund </b>owned by CFPEI with the earnings being paid annually to the agency in whose name the fund was established.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Earnings can be withdrawn from an agency fund but not the principal.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Again, under this scenario, the Cadogan Foundation makes decisions about grants.</p>
<p>An <b>Interest Fund</b> owned by CFPEI with decisions about grants being made by CFPEI for the purposes defined in the agreement.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In making grants, CFPEI would welcome recommendations from you and/or the Cadogan Foundation.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>We have developed a number of pro forma agreements.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I am enclosing one for each of the scenarios noted above.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They are proforma only and leave room to accommodate other possibilities of interest to the donor.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I hope, David, this is of some help in your deliberations.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Do not hesitate to write or call if you need further information.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As mentioned, I will be out of country until October 16.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Sometime after that, likely in late October, I plan a visit to the Miramichi and would be delighted to meet at a mutually convenient time to talk further about community foundations in general and the Cadogan Foundation in particular.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Regards</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Don</p>
