<p><b>Wool and Yarn</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>We always kept a few sheep, perhaps a dozen or so – nor am I sure of the breed although I know they were white.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The sheep had their own shed at the top of the hill where we coasted.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was easy to climb onto the roof of the sheep shed and jump off into the snow bank, which curled around it. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Each spring there were new lambs, usually twins but sometimes only one; they always seemed sickly and some had to be nursed with a bottle.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Sometimes they were brought into the house for a few days,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Some died.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But they were cute.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In early summer the sheep had to be sheared.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Sheep shears were hand operated, very sharp and were hinged at one end not hinged in the middle like a pair of scissors.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I never sheared<span class="Apple-converted-space">     </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>sheep but I helped Norman on at least one occasion. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>One put a few boards on top of sawhorses.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Sheep were caught and their front and hind legs were tied together.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Then they were put on the table and sheared.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Norm was pretty good at it although occasionally nicked the skin and drew blood.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Sometimes the sheep had ticks and had to be dusted or sprayed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They sure looked funny with all the wool removed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Shearing sheep was a dirty, smelly job partly because the wool was so oily.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I remember Norm bringing home half a dozen sheep in the old Model A.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He had removed the back seat and turned up the seat on the passenger side.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Also in the spring of the year, we docked the tails of the lambs.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Docking meant cutting off their tails to leave only a stub.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This was done with one chop with a sharp axe.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We had small cloth squares, perhaps a 4-inch square, and a bit of grease was put on the cloth and over the end of the stump.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This was used to keep the wound clean.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>After the ground warmed but before the grass grew, it was necessary to wash the wool.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was a major undertaking.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The bags of wool were opened and the real dirty parts were snipped off and discarded.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>In preparation for washing, rainwater was saved in large tubs and buckets.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Rainwater was used because it was softer than water from the well thereby using less soap but more important, resulting in cleaner wool.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The water was heated on the wood stove then the wool was washed and rinsed several times; the actual washing was done in the front yard.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Once Mum determined that the wool was clean, it was spread out in little, thin swatches on the grass to dry.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The clumps were small and kept thin so that they would dry quickly.<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>The wool would be left over night, or perhaps over a couple of nights, to dry then gathered up and bagged.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Later, the wool would be bundled into the old Model A Ford and taken to Brown’s Woolen Mills in Nelson.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I was only there once but I remember the big machines and the noise.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In my time, I think that it was the only operating woolen mill on the Miramichi.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The wool would be weighed and Mum would tell the manager what she wanted in the way of yarn – so many skeins of grey, white and sometimes other colours.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Then she would bargain as to what she thought she should get in return for the wool.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I think that you could get your own wool back as yarn or you could simply take an equivalent amount that was already in skeins.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The woolen mills got paid by taking wool rather than being paid in cash.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Mum sometimes had more wool than she needed so she would sell it to neighbours and, I think, she had some customers by mail.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Mum then knitted the wool into socks, mitts and sometimes sweaters for the family.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She could knit a pair of mitts or socks in a day or two and usually knitted while visiting or talking with family in the evening.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She often knitted socks or mitts for relatives or friends as Christmas gifts.</p>
