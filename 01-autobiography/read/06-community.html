<div class="reader-summary">This extensive document (spanning ~5800 words) provides comprehensive history of Black River as Don recalls it. Coverage includes the physical geography of the river, early settlement by United Empire Loyalists and Scottish settlers post-1776, the progression from forestry to farming, and economic activities including shipbuilding, lumber, and fishing. Don documents place names (Upper Black River, Middle Black River, Little Branch, Fowlie&#x27;s Mill, McKenzie Settlement), major institutions (four schools, two churches, community hall), the mill economy (Fowlie&#x27;s gristmill and sawmill, John W. MacNaughton&#x27;s operation), and the impact of WWII on community stability. He includes personal economic data from his brother Walter&#x27;s 1947-48 record book showing butter prices (45 cents/lb), egg prices (30 cents/dozen), and woodcutting/threshing crew practices. The document captures Don&#x27;s detailed knowledge of community infrastructure and traditional rural life before modernization.</div>

<p><b>THE COMMUNITY OF BLACK RIVER IN 1939</b><b></b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Although these notes focus on the community in 1939, a bit of background may be in order.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>The Black River</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The Black River is about 7 miles south of Chatham, New Brunswick and, like most rivers in Eastern New Brunswick, flows from west to east eventually emptying from the south into Bay du Vin which is part of the Miramichi River estuary.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Black River is thought to have received its name xxx.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The Eastern boundary of the Black River was the Victoria Bridge near its mouth although technically the river extends beyond the bridge before melding with the waters of the Bay du Vin.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The Black River has many tributaries the largest being the Little Black River, better known as Little Branch. Which joins the Black River near its mouth. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The Black River area was, and to a large extent still is, heavily forested with black, red and white spruce and balsam fir, some pine, white and yellow birch, maple, beech with a scattering of ash, xx.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>While the forests were and continue to be significant, Black River began to switch from forestry to farming earlier than some of its neighbouring communities.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>A Brief History</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Although land had been granted along the shores from Hexham east, settlement of the Black river only occurred after the turn of the century and by 1850 settlers could be found as far west as the Meadows near the headwaters of the river. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The first settlers were United Empire Loyalists who, after the American Revolution of 1776, sailed north along the New England coast and, for the most part, entered the Bay of Fundy landing at Saint John, New Brunswick.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Many moved up the Saint John River with some crossing to the east coast via the upper reaches of the Miramichi; others came directly to the Miramichi.<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Loyalists were soon followed by settlers from the old country - most were Scottish and Presbyterian.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>After six to eight weeks on the ocean, they set foot in the New World.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Some after an initial settlement elsewhere in the Maritimes, found their way to the Miramichi work in the shipbuilding.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Once on the Miramichi, exploration and settlement developed on its tributaries including the Black river.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>From the Miramichi, settlers soon pushed into the Black River and its tributaries; once there, they climbed its banks and, finding a level spot, unpacked their belongings and had a bite to eat.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Then they pitched their tents and began among the virgin timber.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The land was heavily forested and the first task would be to make a clearing and prepare lodging for the coming winter, Initial homes were made of logs cut on the property by hand; crevices between the logs were stuffed with moss to keep out the cold and snow.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Logs not needed were used for firewood; the remainder was burned.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>With the arrival of warm weather, the first seeds many brought with them – including wheat, oats, corn, beans, etc - potatoes and other garden vegetables were planted and harvested among the stumps – and all by hand.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>By winter, a root cellar had been built to keep vegetables from freezing during the long winters.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>A cow and a pig were purchased from neighbours in the nearest community and a shed provided for their shelter – a horse would be added later.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In time houses became homes, roads were constructed, then churches and schools, and the community of Black River became a reality.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Transportation between settlements was mainly by boat hence the fact that initial homes were located near the riverbank.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Settlers would make the occasional trip by boat to Loggieville for supplies.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Later, commercial boats carried passengers and supplies dropping them off at various locations along the coast often taking fish on the return trip.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The dates on which grants were made also reflect the fact that, in the case of Black River, settlement proceeded up the river from its mouth. Adjacent lands along at Hexham and in Miramichi (Bayside) were granted in the 1780's and 1790's; settlers began to spread up the Black River, at least along the south side, after the turn of the century. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Initially blazed paths, and eventually roads were made between communities. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Area Place Names</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>The following place or area names were commonly used in black River around 1939:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Black River, </b>originally called Glenelg, generally included all of the communities along the river. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><b>Upper Black River</b> was a name applied to the community on the North side of the Black River around the junction of the River and Route 11 (the Richibucto road)<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><b>Middle Black </b>River included the settlement around where the Cameron Bridge spanned the Black river</p>
<p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><b>Upper Settlement was a name given to that portion of Upper Black river on the north side of the river and to the west of route 11.</b><b></b></p>
<p><b>The Meadows was a community, vacant by 1939, on the south side of the Black river and west of Route 11.</b></p>
<p><b>Little Branch included all the settled area on both sides of the Little Black River.</b><b></b></p>
<p><b>Fowlie's Mill was a settlement of Fowlie's located on the little Black River which included a sawmill and at one time included a grist mill</b><b></b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>McKenzie Settlement, </b>on the MacKenzie road which at one time was a post road from Richibucto to Bay du Vin did not have any residents in 1939. <b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Miramichi </b>was<b> p</b>robably named by Cartier in 1535 from Montagnais <i>Maissimeu Assi</i><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>meaning Micmac Land.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Glenelg Parish</b> was established in 1814 and was named by Major McDonald who settled in the area around 1790.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In fact the community of Black river was previously known as Glenelg.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Hexham</b> was the name of the settlement, which developed at the eastern end of the road along the north side of Black rover.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Millers Bridge </b>is the local name for the bridge over the brook that empties into the Little Branch River just east of the bridge.</p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Sturgeon Brook </b>flows into the Black River from the north side about a mile east of the Cameron Bridge.</p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Wells Brook</b> flows into the south side of the black river about 2 miles east of Route 11.</p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Ken’s Hill or Kenny’s Hill </b>reflects the name of the owner of the adjacent land, Ken MacDonald's a hill<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Jessie’s Corner</b> marks the southwestern corner of the Jessie MacDonald property – a property that in turn was the rear line of a number of properties along the black river road.</p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>South Side refers to the road running from east to west along the south side of the river; the south side sometimes was limited to that portion of the road on the south side of the river between the Cameron Bridge and trout 11.</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>North Side refers to the road running parallel to and along the north side of the black River.</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Gunn’s Point originally part of a grant of land to <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Gunn later became a burial ground and with St. St. Stephens’ United Church occupying the remainder.</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Point Aux Carr Road/The Shortcut was a road connecting Black River and Point Aux Carr </b>is a community immediately north of the Black River nestling on the south shore of the Miramichi.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>The people</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>By 1939, there were 120 households along the Black River and its tributaries, two churches, four schools and a community hall.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was a stable, hard working and God-fearing community where people made their living from the land, sea and forests.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But it was a community about to change. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The old family names predominated although a few names disappeared; I can only think of one new family to the community. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Presbyterian and United – only one Roman Catholic family</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Whether it was the United Empire Loyalist or Scottish roots, or both, the community from the earliest of times valued education.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was not surprising, therefore, that Black River was among the leaders when school consolidation was first discussed in the late 1930’s.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In fact, the Miramichi rural High School, built in the neighbouring distinct of Bayside, was the first of a series of rural high schools constructed in New Brunswick.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That honour was soon shared by a similar rural High School on Deer Island; some 50 others had to wait until the close of WW2.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Conflict in Europe soon called its sons and daughters both to the armed forces but also to the plants producing goods and services for a country at war.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Although most returned from the war, many returning veterans as well as those engaged in the industries of war no longer made Black river their home.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Most returned, some did not.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Some returnees continued to make Black River there home but many became part of the great movement from country to city and from fields, farms and woods to factories in central Canada.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>The Economy</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>My reading suggests that early settlers spent much of their time eking out a living.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Lumber and fish appear to have been the first cash crops.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Shipbuilding and the supply of lumber for the British market was a major industry.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The advent of steel and steam brought an end to that industry.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A report of a visit to black river in 1833 notes that settlers in the area were heavily engaged in agriculture while another report about Bay du Vin in the following year notes their continuing heavy dependence on lumbering.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>It was primarily a farming community.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Farms were small and mixed; most folk grew their own food.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Barter was the order of the day.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Little cash traded hands.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A half-dozen milk cows and some young cattle, a couple of horses and the horse-drawn implements, 25 hens, maybe a few geese and ducks, meat and vegetables, and usually had a pig or cow for winter meat.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Eggs and butter were traded at the local store, and later in Loggieville or Chatham, for sugar, tea and other staples.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Employment was practically nil; a few people worked at the local sawmill.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Many went off to work in the woods during the winter and drifted for salmon in the summer.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Not much cash traded hands.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Most people farmed – or at least, they lived on a small farm</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Living Costs</b><b></b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>According to records kept by my brother, Walter Glendenning, in 1947 he received 45 cents per pound for butter, 30 cents a dozen for eggs, $5.00 for a young pig and 55 cents per hour for work with New Brunswick Hydro.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Walter’s record book</b></p>
<p> </p>
<p>On April 5, 1948, Walter cut his wood - 24 inches for the furnace and 16 inches for the stove.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The following comprised the crew:</p>
<p><i></i><br></p>
<p><i></i><br></p>
<p><i>James A Watling – 		1 day		</i></p>
<p><i>Murray MacNaughton –		I day	$4.00</i></p>
<p><i>Theodore Fowlie – 1 day		$4.50</i></p>
<p><i>Fraser MacRae – 		½ day	$2.00</i></p>
<p><i>Claude McDonald – 		1 day</i></p>
<p><i><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Jack McDonald</i> –		½ day	$2.00</p>
<p><i>Cecil McDonald –		21/2 hrs</i></p>
<p><i>Norman Glendenning – 		1 day</i></p>
<p><i>John Glendenning – 		1 day</i></p>
<p><i>Walter Glendenning – 		1 day</i></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Another entry shows shared costs for the woodcutter of:</p>
<p> </p>
<p><i>12 gal. Gas $3.00; <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>1 gal. Oil <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>$1.25</i><i></i></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Another entry shows 43/4 hr at John’s; 43/4 at company pile and 43/4 hrs at own pile.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I believe this refers to some wood that John and Walter cut in common, perhaps on Crown land, as well as their own supply.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>On October 18, 1948 Walter threshed his grain.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The following comprised the crew:</p>
<p> </p>
<p><i>James T. D Watling	3 hrs	$5.50</i></p>
<p><i>Fraser McRae		$2.00</i></p>
<p><i>J.D. McRae		Returned</i></p>
<p><i>Godfreys		Returned</i></p>
<p><i>John Glendenning	</i></p>
<p><i>Sterling Cameron	Returned</i></p>
<p><i>Murray McNaughton	pd</i></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b><i>Both the above cases illustrate the custom of woodcutting and threshing crews comprised of folk who exchange time as well as those who were paid.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Given the amount paid to James T. D. Watling, I wonder if he owned the thresher.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Although we shared ownership of a woodcutter with Uncle Jim, we did not have our own thresher. We also shared a stationary engine with Uncle Jim.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I think that we used a thresher owned by George Adams, Sr. who brought thresher and engine on a sloven.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Sometimes we used our own engine but I cannot recall who provided the thresher.</i></b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Mills</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The History of Bay du Vin records a sawmill in Bay du Vin operated by Ortho Robichaud in 1789.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The same history also reports that in 1833, Mr. George Fowlie erected a water-powered gristmill.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The mill, together with wheat, oats and oatmeal was totally destroyed by fire (actual date of fire not known) but believed to be shortly after the mill was constructed; arson was thought to be the cause.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>An undated newspaper clipping quotes Eldon Fowlie as saying the gristmill was very busy during WW! Supplying flour to many communities along the Miramichi.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In 1932, after being idle for many years, the gristmill was remodeled.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The gristmill was the site of a training program, offering carpentry and perhaps blacksmithing, for young unemployed med on the community just prior to WW2.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I do not believe the gristmill operated after that.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Fowlie’s also operated a sawmill at the same site but I do not know when it was established, however, the sawmill was operating in 1939 and, I believe, was the largest employer in the community. employing about a dozen men.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>John W. MacNaughton operated a sawmill across from his home in Upper Black river during the summer months.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I know that it was operating in the late 1940’s and believe that it was operating also in 1939.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was driven by a gasoline or diesel engine.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Road system</b><b></b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>According to the History of Bay du Vin, 25 pounds was appropriated in 1819 to develop a road from Black River to Bay du Vin and, in 1824, John Bailey Williston was given a sum of money to build the road from Bay du Vin to Black River to a width of 20 feet.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>By 1939, it was a ribbon development of unpaved roads following the course of the river on both the north and south sides; a side road led to the Wells brook settlement and another road looped around the Branch</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Roadways were often below the level of the surrounding fields.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In addition, the sides of the road were covered with blueberry bushes, shrubs and small trees.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Some roads also were bordered with wooden rail fences.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As a result, winter travel was often by ice on the river or temporary roads through farmer’s fields or adjoining woods. They were roads designed and to hold snow in winter when times were demanding year round transportation.</p>
<p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Road maintenance was minimal.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A horse drawn grader was available on schedule to scrape ditches and shape roads.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Each landowner was required to provide a certain number of hours of Statute Labour, better known as “stated labour”.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Work done with a team of horses counted for more than the efforts of a man with pick and shovel.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I cannot remember any powered road equipment in my time although I am sure it existed elsewhere</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The Bark Road was used in winter to haul bark from the Black River area to be used in both Chatham and Newcastle during the shipbuilding era.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is likely that started up the Mackenzie Settlement, crossed woodland properties in the Branch and Black River, crossed the Black River, travelled along the short cut towards Point Aux Carr then turned west, crossed the Napan road and eventually ended up at Chatham or Newcastle.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Even when I was a youngster, I remember someone pointing out the a bark road which by then was only an overgrown road where it crossed our property but could be more clearly seen and perhaps even used where it crossed the McKnight Road.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>While I am not sure of the year when the Richibucto road was paved, I do recall traveling once with Uncle Jim Watling to Chatham by horse and wagon – and we traveled the unpaved Richibucto road (Route 11) It was newly built and covered with fine grey gravel.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Bridges</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>There were three covered bridges in Black River.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The longest, the Victoria Bridge had a pier in the center of the span and was located near the mouth of the River.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The Cameron Bridge at Middle Black river was the shortest consisting of a single span without any central piers.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The Little Branch Bridge had near the mouth of the Little Branch River <span>was composed of two spans - one long and covered and the other short and open. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The spans met at a common pier which was a wooden crib filled with field stone and clad with plank. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>All three covered bridges were of the same design consisting of large trusses designed to take the weight of the bridge and the wagons crossing them.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Other than nails and spikes, were the huge steel vertical steel rods helping to support the weight.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The bridge had a shingled pitch roof and the sides were boarded vertically. The main floor was planked crosswise with a final flooring of 2-inch plank running lengthwise. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Smaller streams were crossed by open bridges with the bridge resting on a crib filled with stone at each end of the span.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Cribbing was usually made of cedar poles filled with granite and graveled to form part of the roadway.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Most of the open bridges had a railing for safety. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Each residence was reached from a small bridge or culvert spanning the ditch running along the side of the road.</p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Schools</b><b></b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>In his book, Black River and its First Settlers, A. W. MacDougall points out that most of the early settlers in Black River spoke Gaelic.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Scots gave high priority to education and it was not surprising that their attention turned to providing instruction first in a barn belonging to Archibald Cameron, Sr. and later teachers provided instruction in their own homes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In 1825, residents petitioned for the erection of a school which was built across the road from the Richard Godfrey residence.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This school, roughly half way between the Little Branch and Cameron Bridges, seems to have served all of Black River and as far east as Bay du Vin.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>About 1845, the district was divided with one school being build at Middle Black River and another at Bayside (now Miramichi).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A few years later a school was erected at Little Branch; the Little Branch School burned a few years later but was soon replaced. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The date of construction of the Victoria school is not known.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Schools were constructed of wood and covered with eastern cedar shingles, which soon turned gray from weathering.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Typically, schools had an entry where one shed ones heavy outer garments.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>On the other end was a woodshed capable of holding 8-10 cords of wood required to keep the school warm in winter.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Some had a pump to provide fresh water; some had a pump that did not work; at still other schools students trudged to a nearby farm house summer and winter carrying water back to the school in an 8 quart pail.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Schools were also served by an outdoor toilet, usually a single building with separate entrances for boys and girls.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Schools in the area offered instruction to the end of grade eight. After that students frequently stayed with relatives or friends in Loggieville or Chatham while they completed the Grade nine or higher.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Many young people, including my sister Venetia, wrote Normal School entrance Exams after Grade Nine and enrolled directly in the Provincial Normal School in Fredericton.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A year later she was a full-fledged teacher. <span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>About 1937, the Rev. Douglas Smith, Rector at St. John’s Anglican Church in Bay du Vin provided tutoring in the Rectory to high school students in the area.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The response was positive and the program expanded.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Soon additional teachers were required and classes were held in the church basement and the local hall. Students from Black River walked, bicycled or traveled by horse to attend school.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In 1939 the Miramichi Rural High School, the first of its kind in New Brunswick, was erected at Bayside (later renamed Miramichi) and classes were moved from the church in January 1940 with 67 students enrolled.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The New High School district included the three Black river Schools – Little Branch, Victoria and the Cameron School.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The district also included Bayside, Auburnville, Bay du Vin and Bay du Vin River.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>With the arrival of the Miramichi rural High School, one-room schools provided instruction only to Grade six; grades 7-11 were available at MRHS with bus transportation to the high school being provided by the Godfrey brothers.</p>

<p><b>Churches</b><b></b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>According to A. W. McDougall, most of the first settlers were Presbyterian and would have been served by an itinerant ministers and missionaries.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The first church, thought to be Presbyterian but used by all Protestants in the area, was built in Bay du Vin in 1812.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In 1818 the people of Bay du Vin, Burnt Church and Tabusintac petitioned for a minister to serve the three charges.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The people of Black River decided to build their own church and, on November 20, 1836, St. Stephens Presbyterian Church was officially opened.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The first building, I believe, was erected between the present church and the cemetery.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The church became dilapidated and, rather than undertake repairs, a new building, the present St. Stephens Church (at that time Presbyterian) was opened on December 30, 1906.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>As a result of the creation of the United Church of Canada in 1925, members who wished to continue in the Presbyterian faith found themselves without a building.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>For a few years they met in member’s homes or the school.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In 1930, St. Paul’s Presbyterian Church was officially opened and St. Stephens continues to serve the community as St. Stephens United Church. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Burial Ground</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>The Black River Cemetery is situated on a point of land known as Gunn’s Point, and later Church Point; it was part of Lot No. 4 originally granted to Enoch Gunn on June 3, 1812.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The property was purchased by Enoch Godfrey in 1820 and the first burial, I believe, was that of Enoch Godfrey’s father-in-law, Robert MacBeath in 1923.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A more detailed history of the church and the cemetery can be found in an article by Ernie MacLean in the <span><i>Spring 2001 Issue of Generations.</i> </span><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Although the nearest church was in Bay du Vin, other burials of Black River folk took place at Gunn’s Point even though the land was privately owned.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In 1836, a new church, St. Stephen’s Presbyterian, was opened in an area now part of the cemetery.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Following Church Union in 1925, St. Stephens United Church gave full burial rights to those former members who decided to continue in the Presbyterians tradition.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Today, this sacred plot is considered a community burial ground.</p>

<p><b>Post Office</b>s</p>

<p>The National Archives has a database, searchable through the Internet, on post offices and postmasters. In checking the Little Branch Post Office, I found the following:</p>

<p><br></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Watling Post Office</b><b></b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>There was Post Office named Watling which opened in 1911 and closed in 1928.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The Postmasters were Donald Watling, A. H. McKay and A. D. Watling</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>At one time there were post offices located at Little Branch, middle Black River and xx.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>By 1939, however, the community was served by a single Post office operated by James T. D. Watling</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>In 1939, Black River was served by a post office operated by James T. D. Watling in Middle Black River.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Mail was delivered to residents on both sides of the river by horse.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As I recall, Jack Gibson was the mail carrier in 1939.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Homes</b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Homes were modest; full two story homes were rare.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Cladding, including roofs, was eastern cedar, usually weather-beaten.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Wood provided energy for both cooking and heating.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Homes with furnaces were fortunate, indeed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Electricity did not arrive for nearly a decade.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Telephone service was available but not in every home.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Horses still were the most common form of transportation both summer and winter.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Recreation</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Recreation in the early days of the community revolved around the home, the school and the church.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>People, adults and children alike, visited homes of relatives, neighbours and friends. often staying overnight; Sunday visits were also frequent.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Even the briefest of visits involved lunch and more often a full meal.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was not unusual for kin, including children to visit for a week or so.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Summer brought church picnics at the Bayshore</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Churches were active social centers.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Families went to church for sure on Sunday morning, and often went as well for an evening service.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Mid week services were common as well as special services such as Christmas<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>and Easter.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Churches also organized church supers either at the church itself, at a local community hall or at a member’s home. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Schools organized both a Christmas and June funtion sometimes in the afternoon and sometimes at night.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Schools were often used for dances both to provide recreation for young people and to raise money for a worthy cause.</p>
<p>In the winter, this was augmented by winter sports especially skating and coasting. dances.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Summer was also a time for family picnics, swimming, berry picking or even picnicking with the men during planting or harvesting.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The Black river and its tributaries were known for its trout fishing.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As son as the ice was out of the river, men and boys dug a few worms, cut a straight alder for a pole, bought a fishing line and a few hooks and headed for their nearest fishing holes.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Winter sports were more limited and usually consisted to coasting or skating after which a group might gather at one or more homes for a lunch and a mini-party.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b><i>Darts</i></b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>We sometimes played darts.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Not having a proper cork dartboard, we played against a barn door or wood wall. Neither did we have darts so we made our own.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>To make a dart, one followed these easy steps:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Find a bottle cork – I cannot recall which household items came in bottles with cork but in our house, it was not wine.</p>
<p>Sharpen a horseshoe nail.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A horseshoe nail was square, slender and pointed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A bit of filing helped.</p>
<p>Push the nail through the cork from the larger diameter to the smaller diameter.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Be careful not to split the cork.</p>
<p>Find two matching wing feathers from hens - preferably feathers that the hen had discarded although I know of feathers having been forcibly removed from a reluctant hen.</p>
<p>Push the quill, end of a feather, into the large end of the cork on either side of the head of the horseshoe nail.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Again, this step often resulted in splitting the cork.</p>
<p>Try the dart turning the feathers as needed to ensure a smooth flight.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Exercise extreme caution that no one is nearby when throwing darts.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>What’s a “buckety wade?</p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>I am not sure of the word or it’s spelling but didn’t we call a teeter-totter a buckety wade?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Seems that we made ours with a 2x6 plank over a fence or gate, or perhaps a sawhorse. (A 2x4 was not strong enough.)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In order to balance the plank, the lighter person would move a bit closer to the end of the plank.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A great demonstration of one of the laws of physics</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Buckety wade</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Stores</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>At one time, the community had many small stores usually located in part of the home but sometimes, as with the one at John W. MacNaughton, in a separate small building beside the road. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>By 1939, as far as I can determine there were only two grocery stores.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Sandy MacNaughton ran a small store in his home in Upper Black river beside the school.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It appeared to offer minimum groceries, candy and pop.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The other one, operated by George Adams, was at the North end of the Little Branch Bridge.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>While part of an extended house, it had a separate entrance and shelves loaded with groceries in the manner of a real store.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Adams also sold gasoline for motorcars.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The gasoline was stored in an underground tank but was pumped by had to a glass chamber at the top of the pump.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Measurement was by the gallon and measurement was by the eye. From the top of the gas pump, gasoline flowed by gravity to the gas tank in the car, located in early models in front of the windshield.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>By 1939, however, automobiles were using fuel pumps.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Utilities</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Electric Power</p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>Electric power came, as I recall, to Black River in the fall of 1948.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The hydro poles had been put in and wires strung the year before.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Mum had the house wired, I think, by Harry Simmonds, months before power was turned on.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I was teaching at the Miramichi at the time and remember coming home from school, probably in September or October, and looking up the hill to see the house lighted for the first time.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Medical</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Dr. MacKenzie</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Dentist</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>At one time, Black River had a resident dentist in the person of Doug Dower.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>His office was set up David Murdoch’s house on the north side of the river just below Uncle Jack Godfrey’s.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I cannot recall whether this was a full-time or part time office.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I do remember, though, that Cameron Russell, my brother-in-law, went to him one Sunday afternoon to have a tooth extracted – extracted, as I recall, without the aid of laughing gas or freezing; Norman remembers going to Doug Dower also on Sunday.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I think that he soon closed his office and moved to Chatham.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Years later, he had a fishing/ hunting camp on the river just above the Horton’s Creek bridge.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Blacksmith shops</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Sinclair Williston lived near the Hexham corner and operated a blacksmith shop.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>His home was in a long lane and one came to the blacksmith shop on the left side of the lane before reaching the house.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was a relatively small shop with a brick forge, bellows, anvil, hammers and tongs, etc.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And of course, like all blacksmith shops, had a very definite smell of coal smoke.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Sinclair did all kinds of blacksmith work, made and sharpened horseshoes, made or tightened wagon rims, made fittings and shoes for sleds, and of course, shod d horses.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It seems to me that horses were shod outside in nice weather but could step inside when the weather was cold or it was storming.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It seems to me furthermore, that he had a special contraption to hold horses that were hard to shoe.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The other blacksmith shop was operated by Johnny Dick in Upper Black river.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The smithy was very close to the road.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Although I cannot ever remember visiting the shop, I am sure that he did all the usual blacksmithing.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>While farm horses used shoes both summer and winter, winter shoes were much sharper and had to be sharpened more often. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Agricultural Society</b><b></b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>With the recent passing of Harry Watling, I was reminded of the Agricultural Society #103.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I do not know the history of agricultural societies generally or of the one in Black River but hopefully someone will prepare their history some day.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I’ve often wondered what happened to all the old records.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I was told once that the books had been turned over to the Agricultural office in Chatham.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I think that there were other agricultural societies in Napan and beyond but none east of Black River.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>An Agricultural Society was like a Co-op.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Farmers banded together and bought seed, lime and fertilizer in bulk and sold it to themselves.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Seems to me that they also handled some agricultural pesticides or herbicides.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Farmers were canvassed each winter; their needs aggregated and then orders were placed. Lime and fertilizer was ordered by the ton (by the boxcar) either loose or bagged.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It came to the station in Loggieville.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When it arrived, John, Walter, Ken and Norm would go to Loggieville and shovel the lime or fertilizer from the boxcar to the wagons for farmers who had bought it.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>When I was young, my Dad kept the Agricultural shed; this meant that he kept the books.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The only auditor I recall was Johnnie McKnight.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And I remember him coming to the house and going over the books.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When he finished, he inscribed the following: “Audited and found correct, John C. McKnight”.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The shed was well-built with a pitch roof, probably 10 to 12 ft wide and 20 to 24 feet long but that is only a guess.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It sat by the west side of the lane across from our back door.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Dad was the Secretary Treasurer and operated the shed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I remember seeing the bags of timothy, alsike clover, red clover, alfalfa, etc.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Farmers would order the amount of each they wanted and then mix their own.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Walter became Secretary Treasurer after Dad died and moved the shed to his place.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I remember the men jacking up the shed and putting extra long bunks on the bobsled to carry the weight of the shed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Then one morning, after a light snowstorm, a team of horses was hitched to the bobsleds and the shed was taken to Walter’s.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When Walter left Black River, I believe that Harry Watling operated the “shed”.</p>

<p><br></p>
<p>And I would commend all who worked diligently since to maintain it.</p>
<p>First some comments about the year 1930:</p>
<p>Black River, like the rest of Canada, was in recession.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There was little or no cash; it was a barter economy. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Families spent much effort just putting food on the table, planting, cultivating, harvesting, preserving and storing for the winter.</p>
<p>Telephone service had not yet arrived</p>
<p>Most travel was by horse and wagon or horse and sled;</p>
<p>There were a few cars but many were stored in barns for lack of funds to buy gas</p>
<p>Social gatherings were held at either the church or the school</p>
<p>The community hall was still in the discussion stage</p>
<p>$2.00 was an average wage, Walter received $1.50 a day for shingling, neighbours traded days for cutting wood and threshing, some equipment was owned jointly.</p>
<p>Dad sold 2x4 to the new hall for 25 cents each, a load of gravel cost $1.50 delivered.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Hired men received $.50 to $1.00 per day plus board.</p>
<p>Roads were built and maintained by hand or with horses; landowners were required to perform so many days of roadwork each year.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This was known as statute or stated labour.</p>
<p>Sadler’s sold long pants for a dollar a pair, McKendys sold 6 water glasses for 29 cents and fancy water pitchers for 45 cents; Rubenstein’s sold fresh country butter for 22 cents a pound</p>
<p>A subscription to the Gazette cost $2.00 per year</p>
