</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Brief account of Don&#x27;s spring chores on the family farm: tapping maple trees on the ridge with his brother Ken, collecting sap in milk cans and barrels, and his mother&#x27;s labor-intensive process of boiling sap into syrup and sugar. Don recalls his responsibility for keeping the woodbox filled during the long boiling process.</div>

<p><b>Collecting Sap</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b></b>We always tapped a few maple trees on the ridge when the nights were cool and the days were warm.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The sap was good to drink but had little if any taste.</p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>I recall occasions of going to the Ridge with Ken early in the morning to empty the sap buckets.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Ken hitched the horse and we took milk cans, of the kind used to ship cream to the creamery and I recall once taking the barrel from the churn to bring the sap to the house.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>On occasion, and maybe frequently, Mum would boil the sap to make maple syrup.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It takes a barrel, 45 gallons, of sap to make a gallon of syrup<b> </b>and it seemed to take forever to reduce sap to syrup.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It took even more boiling to reduce sap to maple sugar. Maybe it seemed like a long time because<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>because it was usually my job to keep the woodbox filled.</p>
