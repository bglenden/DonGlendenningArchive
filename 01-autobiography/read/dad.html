  Dad  
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Don&#x27;s personal memoir of his father Elmer Glendenning, recounting scattered memories including conversations on a porch couch, waving to Richard Godfrey, a harrowing experience with horses during a storm inside Victoria bridge, his father&#x27;s death in 1938, and the large funeral that followed. These intimate recollections reveal Don&#x27;s close family connections and early life experiences in rural New Brunswick.</div>

<p><b>Dad</b></p>
<p><b>June 26 ?1875-May 18 or 19, 1938 – about midnight</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>I’ve told quite a bit about my father in my family documents and family chronicles so will not repeat it here.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Actually remember very little direct contact with my father</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Dad had made a wooden couch, it was in the front porch, porch was across the whole front of the house and closed in; Dad was stretched out on the couch and I was stretched out with him; it may have been the tome either Grace or Venetia was getting or had just been mentioned because I said something about getting married Dad said, No, I won’t be here/there but your mother likely will be</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>One summer day, we were driving from the Branch towards the church, in the buggy, may I was driving in one of the light was driving wagons/<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Richard Godfrey was in his back field, quite a ways from the road.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Dad raised his hand about shoulder height and waved.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I asked Dad why he waved and he said something about recognizing people.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>John and Dad and I</p>
<p>Team of horses</p>
<p>Alex Major's probably Alex's father heavy winds and threatening rain – near Uncle Jack Godfrey’s</p>
<p>Alex suggested that we step the team into the barn floor until the storm was over, Dad said no</p>
<p>We started home Were inside the Victoria bridge</p>
<p>Horses got scared</p>
<p>John got off and led the horses through the covered bridge. Bridge actually was blown a bit sideways</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Remember when he died; Uncle Chip had come down from Bathurst and stayed a few days.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He died about midnight; think I remember the commotion of in the house but did not get up <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Next morning I came down stairs don’t recall who told me Dad had died but I seemed to know.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>His body was back from embalming.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Mum took my hand and walked<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>me in to the parlour.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I remember someone asking Mum if she had been in yet; she said no and then held my hand and took me in to the parlour.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Later in the morning I remember Ken and Norman piling up some of the furnace wood, presumably tidying up for the funeral</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>As I recall, it was a large funeral, Bedford Peters, Dad’s cousin was in the RCMP, directed the traffic.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He opened the gat by the hen house, the orchard field, to provide more parking spaces.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I also remember to long string of cars and presumably wagons although I do not remember.</p>
