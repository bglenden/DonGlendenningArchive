<div class="reader-summary">Don recalls a dangerous near-fire in the family home when a cracked furnace allowed flames into the brick chamber while cats disturbed insulation material on top. His brother Kenneth extinguished the fire and the furnace was later replaced with help from Norman MacKenzie.</div>

<p><b>A Near-fire</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Ken and I were recalling a near fire at home, I am not sure of the year.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As I recall, Ken, Norm and I were hauling wood one spring day, although there was still lots of snow around.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We were hauling the wood on a large hand-sled, John’s sled we always called it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Ken smelled smoke and was met by smoke when he opened the cellar door.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>At our place, the furnace firebox was set inside a brick box about 5’x5’ x5’.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Another brick wall was built outside the first leaving an air space between the two walls of brick acted as an insulator.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The furnace itself would handle a stick of wood four feet long.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Forming a cap over the furnace was a sheet metal covering with a number of openings to which pipes could be attached to lead the warm air to various rooms above.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>On top of the sheet metal was a layer of sand to also act as insulation.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Seems that the cats were playing on the sand on top of the furnace and pushed off one of the covers.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>At the same time, the cast iron furnace had cracked allowing flames to enter the chamber.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Something caught fire. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>As I recall, Ken came to the rescue and quickly got pails of water to douse the fire.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>It was shortly thereafter, as I recall, they replaced the cast iron furnace.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was very heavy and they used a rope to hold it back when sliding it down the cellar stairs.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Norman MacKenzie, who was a big, husky man, helped Walter and John ease the furnace down to the basement and replace the old one.</p>
