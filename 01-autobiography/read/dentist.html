<div class="reader-summary">Brief account of Doug Dower, a resident dentist in Black River who operated from David Murdoch&#x27;s house (north side of river below Uncle Jack Godfrey&#x27;s property). Don recalls his brother-in-law Cameron Russell and brother Norman visiting Dower for tooth extractions on Sunday afternoons without anesthesia. Dower later closed his office, moved to Chatham, and eventually established a fishing/hunting camp near Horton&#x27;s Creek bridge.</div>
