  20 East or West
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">A detailed autobiographical narrative covering Don&#x27;s 1969 decision to move to Prince Edward Island. Describes his departure from Ottawa&#x27;s Training Branch (1962-1968) due to restructuring and loss of collegiality, his interview process for a Nanaimo community college presidency, and his deliberate choice to decline British Columbia in favor of PEI after an unsatisfactory conditional job offer. Demonstrates his character: intellectual rigor (organizational theory from Indiana), respect for organizational culture, and principled decision-making. Includes memorable anecdote about the Board&#x27;s assumption that &quot;given the opportunity, one would choose BC over any other offer.&quot;</div>

<p><b>East or West		</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>People leave current jobs or positions more often than they seek new ones.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That was certainly the case with my leaving Ottawa in 1969.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>By the end of spring semester, 1962, my course work at Indiana University in Bloomington, Indiana, was completed, a thesis topic approved but the actual writing had not started.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Carol had worked ever since we were married, but now we had an addition to our family, a six month old baby boy.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I sought full time work.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Canada had just launched a major program to provide both operational and capital support for technical and vocational training and the Federal Government was adding staff; on July 2, 1962, I joined the Training Branch, Department of Labour in Ottawa.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Most of the people in the Branch were specialists – vocational high school, apprenticeship, educational upgrading, technical training, occupational training and occupational analysis.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My assignment was in the area of vocational teacher training; it was a new initiative and an exciting place to work.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Six years later, however, matching grants had lost favour and a seat purchase arrangement was initiated.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The collegial atmosphere of the Training Branch and the partnership with the Provinces had evaporated.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In fact, the Training Branch was being downsized and perhaps even phased out while training decisions were being made at the Regional level.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Finally, all, or practically all, of the senior staff were replaced and people with a training background were not greatly valued.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In addition, I had lost confidence in the newly appointed Branch Director and began to think about moving.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But where?</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>In another recollection I told about meeting Dr. Ted Sheffield and learning about the proposed College in Prince Edward Island.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>About the same time I learned about and applied for the presidency of a new community college being established in Nanaimo, British Columbia. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It sounded challenging.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>An invitation came from British Columbia to participate in an interview, in fact, two interviews.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The first was an interview in a Vancouver Hotel by an “education panel” presumably to check my educational credentials.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In attendance, as I recall, were the Dean of the Faculty of Education at UBC, the Principal of the Vancouver Vocational Institute, a senior member from the Ministry of Education, and a few others.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I must have passed because I was invited to Nanaimo to meet with the Board the next day for further interviews – presumably to assess my personal suitability.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The second interview was with the College Board of Governors in Nanaimo.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was a Saturday; I could tell that the interview was going well.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I was questioned on many things but one I remember dealt with college organizational structure.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I was ready for this question because, as part of a course at Indiana University, I had thought about alternate ways of organizing and, in fact had presented a paper on the subject.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I proposed an organization with a number of divisions each with a director reporting directly to me – technology, business, applied arts and administration; I think that I separated the academic from the business side of the administrative organization, but I am not sure.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There were other candidates to be interviewed but at the end of my interview I was invited to come back on Sunday morning for further discussion. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Two things struck me about the interview process.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>One was the desire by the Board to find a position within senior management for a local candidate; the Board kept pushing for a vice president but I was not comfortable with that for a new and small institution.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In addition, there was the assumption, shared quite widely in BC as I found out later, that given the opportunity, one would choose BC over any other offer.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Never once during my interviews did the interview panel ask if I had any questions or would like to volunteer information that had not been asked for. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Later while chatting with a Board member who had driven me to the nearest bus stop, I expressed some reservations about the position.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The whole tenor of our conversation changed and I was given all the reason why BC should be my first choice.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Apparently it had never occurred to the Board that, given the opportunity, a candidate would opt for any place but British Columbia.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I returned to Ottawa.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>A couple of weeks later I received a phone call from the Board Secretary , in effect, offering me the position conditional on my accepting the local candidate as my Vice President. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I remember my response very clearly.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“But as you recall, I do not plan to have a vice President but when the time comes for one, I certainly am willing to consider the local candidate”.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A few days later I received a telegram offering the position without any conditions. (I still have the telegram in my possession.)</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Between my interview in BC and the offer, I had applied and been interviewed for a position on PEI but no decision had been taken.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Without knowing the PEI decision, I decided to turn down the BC offer.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That they would make such conditional offer did not sit well with me.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In addition, as I recall, many College Board members were “representative” appointments, that is they were appointed or elected by a constituency.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This, I felt, presented a potential for distraction from the task that I did not need.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>By rejecting the offer from the west, I was opting for the east – if an offer was made.</p>
<p><br></p>
