  Fowlies Mill
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Don documents Fowlie&#x27;s Mill on the Little Branch River, citing an 1833 Gleaner quote praising George Fowlie&#x27;s new gristmill producing &quot;superior quality&quot; flour. The sawmill was constructed adjacent to the gristmill; in 1939, the gristmill was defunct but the sawmill still operated, both water-powered. Don recalls the old gristmill served as a training center for carpentry and blacksmithing around 1939-40 as part of a national program for unemployed youth. He mentions boarding participants including Hes Ross and Hugh Gibson. Photographs from Everard and Bertie MacLean (dated 1940) show John Fowlie, his horse and cart with mill ends, and George R. Fowlie operating the sawmill. This demonstrates Don&#x27;s access to community archival materials and personal anecdotes about pre-war employment programs.</div>

	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Although
	there were a number of sawmills in the area, it appears as though
	the first gristmill, paddled powered, was located on the Little
	Branch River.  <u>LOOKING
	BACK: A History of Bay du Vin New Brunswick</u><i>
	</i>provides the
	following quotation from the Gleaner in 1833:</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><u>&quot;</u><i>“Mr.
	George Fowlie erected a grist mill on the Little Black River, which
	commenced grinding last week.  We have seen some bread made of the
	flour manufactured at this mill and it was of superior quality.  It
	has a never failing stream of water and will be a great
	accommodation to the inhabitants of Bay du Vin and adjoining
	settlements where such an establishment was much wanted.”  </i>
	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Later
	a sawmill was constructed adjacent to the gristmill. 
	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">According
	to my recollection, in 1939, the gristmill was but a shell but the
	sawmill still operated and both were water powered.  In fact, about
	this time, the old gristmill served as a training centre in
	carpentry and blacksmithing.  It was part of a national program to
	provide some basic skill training to the many unemployed youth in
	the area.  Participants boarded with local families including Has
	Ross and Hugh Gibson who boarded at my home.  Shortly after, many of
	these young men were off to war.</p>

	from the collection of Everard and Bertie MacLean – taken in 1940
	from top to bottom show John Fowlie, John Fowlie’s horse and cart
	with a load of mill ends and George R. Fowlie, sawyer,  showing
	piles of lumber in the background</p>
