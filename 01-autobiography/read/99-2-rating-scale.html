  99 -2 Rating Scale
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Don recounts observing a handyman&#x27;s consistent, self-directed, quality work and wonders why schools don&#x27;t develop similar practical rating scales for employment-bound students and vocational learners. He advocates for rating scales with five or six competency levels that focus on practical attributes (speed, accuracy, initiative, safety, quality) rather than abstract grades. This approach, he argues, enables self-assessment discussion and strengthens soft skills and personal attributes. He also notes Ontario&#x27;s 2020 math curriculum redesign incorporating financial literacy and coding, suggesting this reflects growing recognition that math education must connect to real-world application.</div>

<p><b>Students said “they wanted instruction that feels relevant, more career pathways, teachers that slow down and after school clubs for socializing, getting homework help, and learning to navigate their schools and communities” -	Washington Post</b></p>
<p>RATING STUDENT PROGRESS</p>
<p>Had someone doing some work around my cottage recently, just handyman stuff – fixing stairs, staining deck, repairing railing, replacing an outdoor light fixture, etc.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He does good work consistently, always know what has to be done next, takes care of his tools and practices safety. And doesn’t waste much time.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I’m wondering why we don’t have develop a similar rating scale for school studies – specially for students who are employment bound<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They’d work also for adults in<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“vocational” programs.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Most rating scales have five or six levels with a brief description of each; as an example:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span>“</span>Can perform some elements of this task but not at a sufficient level for the work force.”</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>This style of rating scale provokes and allows great discussions when used as a basis for self assessment and certainly is an ideal<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>way to strengthen soft skills and personal attributes.</p>

<p>CHANGES TO MATH PROGAM<span>	</span></p>
<p>“Ontario students returning to el-ementary school in September amid a mix of online and in-class learning will also be met with a new math curriculum that includes financial literacy, coding and "back to basics” fundamentals…..</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>“Starting in September, parents can look forward to a math curric-ulum that not only goes back to basics but equips our next genera-tion of leaders and community builders with the math skills they need to build a bright future for all of us," Ford said.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The curriculum presented on Tuesday was developed after two years of consultation with parents, math educators, academics and math experts….; interesting nit to include employers - homework help, and learning to navigate their schools and communities” - homework help, and learning to navigate their schools and communities” – CTV <span>News, Toronto</span></p>
