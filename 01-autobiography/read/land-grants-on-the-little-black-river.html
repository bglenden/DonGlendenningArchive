  Land Grants on the Little Black River
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Dated August 18, 2004, this detailed genealogical document lists original land grants along Black River and tributaries with grantee names, acreage, and dates. Don traces his maternal ancestry through Jubal Watling (his grandfather), noting grants of 100 acres at Lot 30 in the Meadows on April 20, 1881. He documents Jubal Watling&#x27;s children, neighbors&#x27; grants from 1812-1881, and traces the family&#x27;s property history. Don recalls his mother Jane (born 1890) walking to school from the Meadows property. The document notes that buildings have &quot;long since disappeared&quot; and &quot;the community has disappeared&quot; with forest reclaiming cleared fields. This demonstrates Don&#x27;s deep genealogical research and family connection to early settlement patterns.</div>
