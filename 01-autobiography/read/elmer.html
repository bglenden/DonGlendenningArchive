<div class="reader-summary">Biographical portrait of Elmer Alton Glendenning&#x27;s early life and career in the USA before 1910 return to Canada. Documents Glendenning family migration to Portland, Maine (siblings including Venetia, Margaret, Frank, Raymond, Guy) and family valuing of education (Uncle Chip&#x27;s business course, Uncle Guy&#x27;s dentistry study, Aunt Margaret&#x27;s nursing). Traces Elmer&#x27;s work progression: likely started in woods of Maine/New Hampshire (near Skowhegan, Millinocket, Berlin); worked lumbering in New Hampshire with horses, establishing record lumber cut on camp wall (recalled by multiple family members). Pre-1910, Elmer and brother Frank operated Glendenning Bros. &amp; Co. cartage business from 24 Hammond Street, Portland (ice delivery service, general team work). Sent money to parents until age 30. Briefly describes Wisconsin work period: January 25, 1910 letter from Wisconsin to sister Jeannie; September 18, 1910 autograph album entry as &quot;Wausau, Wisconsin&quot; address; July 18, 1910 postcard from dam work at Rothschild, Wisconsin. Notes dam construction work (logging improvement and power generation purposes). Recounts author&#x27;s 1993 Portland visit finding East Portland/Munjoy Hill completely rebuilt. Places Elmer within context of Maritimer migration wave to &quot;Boston States&quot; for economic opportunity.</div>

Glendennings seemed to have been well
established in Portland at the turn of the century with Venetia, the
oldest child likely having played the role of &quot;host&quot; as
each new family member moved south.  Venetia's address was Falmouth
Foreside which is just north of Portland and between Portland and
Freeport.  Falmouth Foreside still exists although it may be
considered part of the Portland metropolitan area.</p>

	We do not know the year that Dad went
	to the USA or where he went first or what he did.  Other brothers
	and sisters known to have lived in Portland, at least for a while,
	included Venetia (Mrs R. L. Doring), Margaret (Mrs Lucas Marsen),
	Frank, Raymond and Guy.   Aunt Maude and Uncle Jim Cormier also
	worked in the USA, I believe in Lincoln, New Hampshire.</p>

	<p lang="en-GB" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
	The family must have valued
	education; Uncle Chip took a business course, Uncle Guy studied but
	did not finish dentistry, Aunt Margaret was a nurse.  Dad may have
	taken some technical courses; I remember some technical books at
	home.</p>

	<p lang="en-GB" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
	My guess, and it is only a guess, is
	that Dad first worked in the woods in Maine and New Hampshire. 
	Walter thought that Dad worked in the woods near Skowhegan and
	Millinocket, Maine.  I believe that he also worked in or near
	Berlin, New Hampshire.</p>

	Dad, and presumably his brothers,
	also lumbered in New Hampshire prior to 1910.  Because they took
	their horses, they must have yarded and hauled logs. I believe that
	they also cut lumber.  John recalled Dad telling about a &quot;record&quot;
	of lumber cut (marked on a camp wall) that stood for many years. 
	Ken thinks that Uncle George Watling, Mum's 
	</p>
	<p lang="en-GB" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
	brother, also worked in the woods
	with Dad and recalls Uncle George telling about the &quot;record&quot;
	set by Dad and his crew. George (Elbridge) Watling told Ken that
	both his father,

	George, and James A. Watling worked
	in the woods with Dad.  Ramsay MacLean, of Upper Black River, worked
	with Dad in New Hampshire.  I recall John saying that he thought
	that Ramsay had been yarding with a horse or a team and, and did not
	install a bridle to slow down the sled on a steep hill, and the logs
	got away from him and dragged a horse down the hillside killing it.
	From my reading of lumbering on the hills in New Hampshire, this
	would not have been an unusual event.  According to Herbert Daley,
	Herb Daley, Dad’s first cousin, also worked with Dad in New
	Hampshire and, perhaps, in Portland.</p>

	<p lang="en-GB" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
	Prior to 1910, Elmer and his brother,
	Frank, operated a business in Portland under the name Glendenning
	Bros. &amp; Co. (All Kinds of Team Work). Robert Glendenning told me
	that Uncle Guy also worked in the cartage business; whether he was a
	partner is not known. They operated from 24 Hammond Street,
	Portland, Maine.  Walter, and others, remember Dad telling about
	delivering ice to homes on a regular basis.  Delivering meant that
	they opened the door and put the ice in the icebox inside the house.
	 Although I always thought it was only Dad and Uncle Frank in the
	trucking business, other brothers may have also been involved.</p>

	</span>In August 1993, while in
	Portland, I visited Hammond Street. The area was primarily
	commercial and fronts on Back Cove.  It is in East Portland which is
	known as Munjoy Hill.  This section of the city had completely been
	rebuilt and there was no trace of #24 Hammond Street.    Uncle Frank
	Glendenning lived nearby at 72 Wilmot Street.  We do not know where
	Dad lived.
