<p>~~~~~~</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>As I Recall:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Some memories of the Little Branch School</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>There were four one-room schools in Black River; I lived near, and attended, the Little Branch School as did my brothers and sisters before me.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Although I lived close to the school, many students lived a mile or more away.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>For most students, the Little Branch School provided their entire formal schooling; a fortunate few stayed with relatives and attended high school in Loggieville or Chatham.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The Little Branch School had a pump that didn’t work and a sink that did.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Listening to my older siblings, however, the sink seemed to be used mostly as a place to ‘strap” students who acted out – strapping meant using a 15 inch ruler across a hand held on top of the sink stand.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Drinking water, a pail in the morning and one in the afternoon, was carried from our house by a couple of boys designated for the task each day.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was more like a half a pail by the time it reached the school, especially if transported down the hill between two boys on a sled.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Obviously there was no water for washing your hands.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The school was down the hill and on the other side of the cove from our house and in winter, our hill became an extension of the playground.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was also a favourite place in the community for evening coasting parties.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The rising tide filled the cove twice a day and at least one school mate found himself up to his neck in salt water one noon hour.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Arbour day was special; we trudged to school with rakes, hoes, pails and scrub brushes to help with a spring clean up; we usually finished by one o’clock and were allowed to go home. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Arbour day was also special because it was the one day of the year I was allowed to carry lunch. My Mother packed a lunch in a 5-pound Dominion shortening pail – red with yellow lettering as I recall. (Some students carried blue-and-white Crisco cans but ours were always a Dominion.). I don’t remember the sandwiches but I do remember the milk. Mum filled an empty vanilla bottle – the large size and I tied a piece of string to the neck of the bottle and hung it in the brook until lunchtime. The milk was “oh so cold” and tasted so good.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The milk from the brook was in contrast to our usual milk kept on the basement floor because we had no electricity in those days.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The school was heated by a wood stove.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>One year, I was contracted to start the fire.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I went to the school about 7:30 am, started the fire and then went home.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>By the time others arrived for classes, the school was warm and comfortable. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>One needed water to clean one’s slate; I usually used a small vanilla bottle and a piece of cloth.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If you forgot to empty the bottle or take it home at night, the water would freeze by morning.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Occasionally a frozen bottle would be thrown into the fire and would make a big bang when it exploded.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>About 1938, Rev. Smith, the Minister at the Anglican Church in Bay du Vin, started high school classes in the Manse.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My two brothers and a sister attended classes there; in summer they walked five miles each way, or rode bicycles; in winter, one of my brothers took other students by horse and sled.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Later Goymer Williston transported students by truck.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>In January 1940, the Miramichi Rural High School opened, the first rural high school in the Province, and students from a number of one-room schools transferred there on completion of Grade six.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>MRHS had battery powered electric lights and inside toilets – what a change from the “four holer” at the Little Branch school.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>MRHS, with an emphasis on school garden, manual training and home economics reflected the influence of the Macdonald Schools scattered across Canada.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>With the new high school came a school bus operated by the Godfrey Brothers.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A chassis was purchased and the body was constructed by local craftsmen; it does not look much like today’s buses but it saved a long daily walk.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The bus was purchased later by Gordon Dick to carry students from Napan and Point Aux Carr to the high school in Chatham.</p>
