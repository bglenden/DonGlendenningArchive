  Boxing Match
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Don&#x27;s vivid childhood memory of June 22, 1938, when Joe Louis defeated Max Schmelling in a famous rematch. Don was eight years old, sitting with his mother across the road from Uncle Jim&#x27;s house where men gathered to listen to the radio broadcast. The incident captures the excitement of a historic boxing moment during a period of rising anti-German sentiment and Don&#x27;s childhood in rural New Brunswick.</div>

<p><br></p>
<p>Feelings ran high.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Schmelling had beaten Louis in an earlier match.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>With the saber rattling in Germany, there was much anti-German sentiment.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Round one began; 2.08 minutes later the fight was over.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Louis knocked out Schmelling.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The fight was over.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The men lingered for a few minutes and then went home.</p>
