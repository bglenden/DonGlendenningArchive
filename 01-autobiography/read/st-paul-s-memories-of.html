<p>St. Paul’s Presbyterian Church</p>
<p>Black River Bridge, NB</p>
<p>July 00, 2023</p>
<p>On this anniversary occasion, I am pleased to provide a few recollections about my life and times in St. Paul’s Presbyterian Church in Black River Bridge, New Brunswick. Although I actually participated in the official opening on July 20, 1930, my memories of the event are a bit hazy.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I understand, however, that older siblings were actually at a church event when I arrived at Little Branch on a Sunday evening a <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>year earlier.</p>
<p>St. Paul’s played a significant role in our family. My father was involved in its construction; my Mother was an active member, siblings played a variety of roles and nephews and nieces are keeping up the tradition. I might also add that many summer Ministers boarded at our home and shared meals and events with our family; their presence was one of my connections to the world beyond Black River.</p>
<p>Sunday services were held at 11.00 am one week and 7:00 pm the next; the change allowed the minister to travel to and from Kouchibouguac9 (awo-point charge) where the schedule was reversed. After a morning service, the Minister travelled to Kouchibouguac<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>where he preached the evening service and stayed the following week. In those days, Ministers, did not have their own vehicle; transportation to the other site was provided by members of St.Paul’s.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>One summer minister, as I recall, had a bicycle to travel back and forth.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>My church experiences were positive; St. Paul’s was a welcoming church. Sunday services were always warm and friendly (most members were related); there was a positive but muted conversation before the service got under way. men gathered outside for conversation (and perhaps another smoke) prior to the commencement of the service;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>I recall sunny Sundays travelling to and from church with Mother and my siblings in the large “express wagon”; wagon travel was leisurely and allowed for conversation about the just completed service as well family and community news of the day.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>With the arrival of a 1939 half ton Ford truck in 1942, my siblings provided transportation to other church members as well.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Services were simple, clear and timely. Music by choir and congregation were always highlights of any service and who could forget the “hissing gaslights” needed to break the gathering night. As the lights came on, shadows lengthened across the Gibson fields to the east.</p>
<p>We were amazingly well served through Bible school, vacation school, lantern slides by visiting missionaries, Mission Band, Young Peoples meetings and rallies, church camps, and the annual church picnic at Bay Side (Now Miramichi). Special mention must be made of Aunt Kate and Uncle Jim Watling, who were active in so many roles; they also hosted many a Sunday school or youth group under their trees in the side yard.</p>
<p>The Women’s Missionary Society met monthly, as the name suggests it focused on Christian outreach; the League, on the other hand played a social and fundraising role. Both met in members’ homes. Men came to provide transportation, stayed in the kitchen and swapped stories about events since they last met.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Some time ago, I had a conversation with a former “child of Black River” about our early experiences. Although, like any community, there were differing views about community issues. we agreed that Black River was a good community to grow up in – and I consider St. Paul’s to have been an important part of those years.</p>
