<div class="reader-summary">September 1, 2008 updated version of the Hall and Stavert tractor story. Provides refined narrative of how Don learned of the tractor&#x27;s existence through Jim Stavert (son of founder), researched the manufacturer, and ultimately connected with Dr. Arleon Kelley to help locate it in Illinois. Shows Don&#x27;s collaborative approach and dedication to reuniting Island artifacts with their heritage.</div>

<p><b>Sept 1, 2008</b></p>
<p><b>Agricultural Heritage Project</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Background notes on the Hallmore Tractor</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>Hall and Saver was a partnership of Harold Hall and Stafford Stanley established in Charlottetown the 1930s.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They operated a foundry and produced equipment primarily for the agricultural and fishing industry.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Around 1940, they produced a conversion tractor.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Most farm tractors were purpose built, however, during the period, a number of companies built conversion kits that allowed a farmer to convert his auto (whether a Model A, Chevrolet, Oakland or whatever) so that it could be used as a tractor.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The conversion kit usually consisted of a sturdy rear axle with rear wheels having strong cleats/lugs.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I became aware that such equipment was manufactured in PEI, probably in 2004 but most likely in 2005, through a conversation with Jim Stavert, son of one of the founders of the company.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Jim told me of a phone call from a Mr. Heim from Chicago enquiring about the Hallmore tractor. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I was curious about the pieces in Mr. Heim’s possession and encouraged Jim to follow up.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In fact, I searched the internet and found an address for Mr. Heim, 15065 Spruce Road, Lockport, Illinois, 60491 and drafted a letter for Jim’s consideration.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Jim revised and sent the letter but there was no response.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The scene shifts to a summer evening in 2006 at my cottage and a conversation with a neighbour, Dr. Arleon Kelley now living in Elgin, Iowa.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Knowing that Dr. Kelley traveled frequently on Interstate 80 between Iowa and Indiana, and that Mr. Heim lived close to that highway, I wondered if Arleon would visit Mr. Heim if the opportunity arose.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>On Arleon’s return to Iowa at the end of the summer, he and his wife took time to look up Mr. Heim.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Through a telephone call and later correspondence I learned more about the visit.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Arleon pulled into the Lockport home and fortunately Mrs. Heim was home early that day.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>An hour’s drive further away, He met Mr. Heim at the family business – a manufacturing plant now being closed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He had a large collection of tractors including a black and red Hallmore tractor conversion on an Oakland chassis and in nearly mint condition.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Tractors were being prepared for storage but eventually are going to a museum under construction in Michigan City, Indiana planned for a 2007 opening.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Unfortunately, Dr. Kelley had left his camera in PEI and, therefore, was not able to take a photo.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As Dr. Kelley was departing the younger Mr. Heim said in effect “now Dad, we know where that tractor will go” <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>On September 12, 2006 I sent an email to Mr. Heim but did not receive a reply; sometime later I attempted a call to Mr. Heim but he was not available and I did not leave a number.</p>
