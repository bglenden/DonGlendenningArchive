Documents rural childhood, school experiences, friendships, radio shows (Lone Ranger), reading (Nancy Drew), sports, family picnics, 1940s fashion, visit to Chicago at age 16, and entry into nursing training (1957) at Methodist Hospital Peoria.

<div class="reader-content">
<p>I was born in Henry,Illinois, a small town of under 1000 people, nestled on the banks of the Illinois river.My parents lived on a farm. Unfortunately my mother died a week</p>
<p>After I was born due to an infection.My sister, Marjorie, was 6.</p>
<p>My father had a housekeeper come in and my sister later went to live with an aunt and uncle in Milwaukee. I stayed on the farm until I was 4 or so and then went to live with</p>
<p>My father’s sister and her husband in Peoria,Ill a short distance away. I stayed there</p>
<p>Until I graduated from nurses training and it really became my “home” as my father<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Died when I was 6.I called my aunt mother and for some reason my uncle was always called uncle ed..perhaps because I knew my father. My aunt and uncle never had children of their own. We lived in a modest white bungalow. I went to grade school a block and</p>
<p>A half away. I remember being very shy and upset <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>when I first attended kindergarten</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I was friends with 2 girls near my age who lived with their widowed mother next door.</p>
<p>We would spend hours playing dressup or store with a play cash register.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I was also friends with a boy across the street and we used to exchange comic books.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I loved to read, especially Nancy Drew mysteries. Another favorite pastime was listening</p>
<p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>To the radio and favorite programs such as the lone Ranger and others which I don’t<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Remember right now.Out door favorites were hopscotch, jumping rope, rollerskating,</p>
<p>Later bicycle riding. I hated baseball as that seemed the main sport that was played<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>But later on I enjoyed girls basketball.In our gym periods we would be required to participate in a sport.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Any vacations we took, which were short would be to visit aunts or uncles in Wisconsin</p>
<p>Or Iowa, automobile trips that would take forever as there certainly were no 4 lane<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Thruways then.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>My sister and I never lived together but we would visit and when she was married, I would often go to see her and stay for a few days.she lived in Henry where one of my grandfathers lived and I would enjoy visits with him and his lovely cherry trees!</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I had many first cousins as my aunt came from a large family.We would meet at least once a year at a family picnic\potluck held in a local park.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>We had very hot summers and violent storms, always wary of tornado warnings.</p>
<p>We would sleep in the basement to get some relief from 100 degree days and high<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Humidity as there was no air conditioning in the homes then.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>My aunt liked to sew and I particularly remember an ugly dress I had to wear in 7<sup>th</sup><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Grade. When I went to high school, I wore sweaters and skirts, penny loafers.</p>
<p>I don’t remember girls wearing jeans then or slacks.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>A wonderful treat I had when I was 16 was a<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>trip on the bus to Chicago to visit my great aunt and uncle. I remember their large brick house and visiting the huge department<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Stores on state street located by Lake Michigan.</p>
<p>We ate all our meals at home and I remember my aunt doing lots of canning such as tomatoes, beans and peaches.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>A favorite pastime was going to the movies on Sunday, always a double header</p>
<p>And first watching the news reels of<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>WW2. Perhaps that is one reason why I find the history of that time period so interesting.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>In high school I remember going to a corner soda fountain after school with friends and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Enjoying cherry cokes. I always walked to school<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>or took a city bus. I don’t remember there being school buses at that time.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Unfortunately in my high school years my uncle became quite sick and died at the</p>
<p>Relatively young age of 59. My aunt (or mom as I called her) stayed on her house until</p>
<p>The age of 92 when she then went to a retirement home.</p>
<p>I went into nurses training in Peoria at the Methodist hospital.We also had a catholic hospital that trained nurses. After I graduated in 1957, I took off<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>to Connecticut with friends to work in nursing.a short time later I was married.</p>
