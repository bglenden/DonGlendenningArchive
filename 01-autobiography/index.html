He advocates for rating scales with five or six competency levels that focus on practical attributes (speed, accuracy, initiative, safety, quality) rather than abstract grades. This approach, he argues, enables self-assessment discussion and strengthens soft skills and personal attributes. He also notes Ontario&#x27;s 2020 math curriculum redesign incorporating financial literacy and coding, suggesting this reflects growing recognition that math education must connect to real-world application.<div class="expanded-tags"><span class="badge badge-low">EDUCATION</span> <span class="badge badge-low">PERSONAL_AFFAIRS</span></div><div class="expanded-file"><a href="read/99-2-rating-scale.html">Read</a> · <a href="files/99%20-2%20Rating%20Scale.docx">Download</a></div></div></td>

The sawmill was constructed adjacent to the gristmill; in 1939, the gristmill was defunct but the sawmill still operated, both water-powered. Don recalls the old gristmill served as a training center for carpentry and blacksmithing around 1939-40 as part of a national program for unemployed youth. He mentions boarding participants including Hes Ross and Hugh Gibson. Photographs from Everard and Bertie MacLean (dated 1940) show John Fowlie, his horse and cart with mill ends, and George R. Fowlie operating the sawmill. This demonstrates Don&#x27;s access to community archival materials and personal anecdotes about pre-war employment programs.<div class="expanded-tags"><span class="badge badge-low">ANECDOTE</span> <span class="badge badge-low">INSTITUTIONAL</span> <span class="badge badge-low">PERSONAL_AFFAIRS</span></div><div class="expanded-file"><a href="read/fowlies-mill.html">Read</a> · <a href="files/Fowlies%20Mill.doc">Download</a></div></div></td>

Reframes education&#x27;s purpose as helping Islanders develop abilities needed for thriving in daily life, not merely what happens in schools. Questions whether limiting education to government-delivered schooling represents too narrow a vision. Criticizes focus on &quot;excellence&quot; without linking to actual learning outcomes. Highlights Saskatchewan Teachers&#x27; Federation calls for shared accountability, provincial education councils, and education hubs. Reviews Hechinger Report&#x27;s coverage of US education trends and contributes financially to the publication. Discusses CVA-ACFP newsletter focus on teacher competencies and university relevance.
