<p>Glendennings are not much given to hyperbole. We tend to
speak with restraint and moderation, with strong feelings
and sentiment kept in check. My wife Marie tells me that
when it&#x27;s time for my own inscription on a gravestone it
should just say &#x201c;everything was fine.&#x201d; As Dad&#x27;s list of
indignities grew over the past year, occasionally he would
allow and I would agree that something or other was becoming
&#x201c;quite the nuisance.&#x201d; With that as background, I will tell you
that Donald Ernest Malcolm Glendenning was an exceptionally
fine man.</p>

<p>Dad was born on September 8, 1929, in Black River Bridge,
New Brunswick &#x2014; the youngest in a family of nine children of
Elmer and Jane Watling Glendenning. His father was a
construction man who worked on major projects in the United
States before bringing the family back to Little Branch in
1919. Savings he had left in an American bank were lost in the
crash that same year Dad was born. By the time Dad came along,
Elmer&#x27;s health was failing, but he was not a man to sit idle.
Dad&#x27;s brother-in-law, Brydone Weeks, remembered Elmer having
Walter wheel him down to the brook where the men were scything
hay. He couldn&#x27;t swing a scythe himself anymore, but he&#x27;d sit
there with his whetstone, sharpening extra blades so the men
always had a sharp one waiting when they came by.</p>

<p>Dad&#x27;s mother, Jane, held the household together &#x2014; and it was
a big household. She baked bread nearly every day, and her
specialties included Yankee toast and apple pie with cream.
Her husband might tell her at noon that twelve or fifteen men
would be in for supper, and she&#x27;d manage it. She loved to have
visitors &#x2014; Don could not once remember her saying she wished
anyone hadn&#x27;t come. And she believed in education, encouraging
her children and everyone around her to continue their schooling.</p>

<p>Elmer died in May of 1938, when Dad was only eight. After
that, the older brothers &#x2014; Walter, John, Kenneth, and
Norman &#x2014; carried on the farm work, and Dad grew up learning
alongside them. He remembered going to the woods with John and
John singing hymns as they came home on snowy evenings. When
Dad was sixteen and working the boats in Chatham, loading
heavy pit props down in the hold, John could see him
struggling. &#x201c;Let me take that one, Donald,&#x201d; he&#x27;d say &#x2014; and he
said it many times. It was a family where everyone did their
share, but they looked out for one another.</p>

<p>Dad attended the Little Branch School through grade eight,
then the Miramichi Rural High School. In 1947 he left home
for Teachers&#x27; College in Fredericton, and by September he was
seventeen and teaching in a one-room school at Kouchibouguac.
He later won a Beaverbrook Overseas Scholarship to the
University of London, crossed the Atlantic by ship, and made
friends wherever he went.</p>

<p>At Bradley University in Peoria, Illinois, he met Carol
Louise Chesney. They were married on January 31, 1958. Dad
headed the technical teacher training program at the New
Brunswick Institute of Technology. He then returned to Indiana
University and earned his Ph.D., and later worked in Ottawa as
a training specialist with the Department of Labour and the
Department of Manpower and Immigration.</p>

<p>By 1968 Ottawa&#x27;s Training Branch was being downsized, and Dad
began to think about moving. He applied for two presidencies:
Nanaimo and Prince Edward Island. Nanaimo offered first, but
with a catch: the offer was conditional on him accepting a
local candidate as his Vice President. Dad believed a leader
needed the autonomy to build their own team. He declined the
offer. By rejecting the west, he was opting for the east.</p>

<p>In 1969, Dad became the founding President of Holland College
on Prince Edward Island, a position he held for eighteen
years. Henry has described the early days of the College for
you. Education was his lifelong passion. He believed schools
spent too much time on grades and not enough on learning. Under
his leadership, Holland College built its competency-based
approach and launched major new programs.</p>

<p>His honours included the Order of Canada and an honorary degree
from UPEI, and Holland College later named Glendenning Hall in
his honour. After retirement, he ran a consulting firm and
helped found the Community Foundation of Prince Edward Island.</p>

<p>But the public record tells only part of the story. Dad was a
man who wrote poetry &#x2014; quiet, careful poems he kept mostly to
himself. After his mother died in 1964, he wrote of passing a
store with greeting cards he would &#x201c;purchase never more for
Mother.&#x201d; He wrote children&#x27;s stories too.</p>

<p>He and Carol built a life on Prince Edward Island centred on
the house on Queen Elizabeth Drive and the cottage at
Glenway, overlooking Orwell Bay. The cottage became the
family&#x27;s gathering place &#x2014; the spot where sunsets were
watched, neighbours became lifelong friends, and children grew
up. He wrote a poem about it: &#x201c;In a world so filled with
turmoil, how fortunate are we, for the experience of Glenway,
our oasis by the sea.&#x201d;</p>

<p>For thirteen years, from 1997 to 2010, Dad published The
Family Chronicle &#x2014; two hundred issues that connected
relatives who didn&#x27;t know they were related, from Scotland to
Australia. When he reached Issue 100, he wrote: &#x201c;Reaching 100
was never an objective but has become a milestone.&#x201d; Then he
carried on for another hundred.</p>

<p>Mom and Dad delighted in their granddaughters, Lisa and
Laura, who came for long visits most summers, where they
would fish, drive the tractor, and get bitten by mosquitoes.
They travelled widely, but always came back to PEI and the
cottage at Glenway.</p>

<p>Dad kept up his regular coffees with old friends and wrote
many letters to the editor about education. In his eighties,
he founded Education 20/20 because he wasn&#x27;t finished. He
kept writing occasional papers into his nineties.</p>

<p>His father had taught him a verse that stayed with him:
&#x201c;Try and try again, boys, you&#x27;ll succeed at last.&#x201d;</p>

<p>Among his papers, Dad had written down his thoughts about
these occasions. He wanted his favourite hymns sung, which you
will hear today: &#x201c;The Lord Is My Shepherd,&#x201d; &#x201c;Haven of Rest,&#x201d;
and &#x201c;Beyond the Sunset.&#x201d; About that last one he wrote: &#x201c;You
know how often we watched the sunset at Glenway and how much I
enjoyed it.&#x201d;</p>

<p>An exceptionally fine man.</p>
