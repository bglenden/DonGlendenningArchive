  Issues-3 Education
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">(185 words):**
This comprehensive document identifies nine interconnected structural issues in education systems, with emphasis on PEI. Don argues that education—complex and individualized—requires clear definitions and systemic alignment. Issues identified: (1) Clarity—lack of definition and shared understanding, perpetuating &quot;educationese&quot; jargon; (2) Purpose—PEI&#x27;s stated purposes lack necessary detail for program development and assessment; (3) Education versus schooling—fundamental definitional confusion confuses roles and increases costs; (4) Structure—failing to organize around identified functions, particularly administrative and instructional services; (5) Autonomy and accountability—insufficient educator autonomy limiting responsiveness to diverse learner needs, despite OECD research showing autonomy improves outcomes; (6) Personalization—calendar-driven delivery ignores individual learner needs and interests; (7) Government relationship—political operation of education systems introduces inefficiency and instability; (8) Quality assurance—tension between teaching and grading roles; (9) Human and social capital—isolation of teachers prevents collaborative culture. Don advocates for systemic conversation and structural reorganization (dated June 5, 2023).</div>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><b>It
is widely recognized that education is a key factor in determining
each citizen’s quality of life; in the same way, the collective
education of our citizens will determine to a significant degree the
quality of the communities in which we live. Government support is
justified for two reasons, one to suppot personal growth and
development for every citizen; the other is to ensure the common
good.</b></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><b>Educating
is a complex matter made so by the fact that each person is unique in
many ways, unique in basic physical, mental, emotional make-up;
unique in the range and nature of previous experience, unique in
perceived futures, but also unique in terms of learning pace, style
and needs.</b></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><b>An
education system is a set of services put in place by a community to
encourage and support the education of its citizen; typical functions
or services include leadership and governance, Information and
counselling, funding, products and technologies, instruction, human
re-sources and quality assurance.   Given the numbers served and the
wide range of prior experience, capabilities and interests of
learners, designing and operating an education system is no easy
task. </b>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><b>CLARITY</b></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><b>information
plays a key role in education matters. Those who teach, or other-wise
serve learners, must be very clear in their communication. Conceptual
clarity heightens our understanding of key words and concepts; lack
of clarity is a significant issue for public education.  It must be
addressed directly so that the concept of education won’t become
di-luted and potentially ineffective. Lack of clarity may arise form
an idea itself, from the person promoting the idea or from the person
receiving the idea; Lack of clarity could also signal conflicting
ideas and levels of discomfort or disagreement from within the
education family group itself and some say  “clarity” is also
related to self confidence.    Conceptual clarify is also a must in
planning and assessing performance. Education has a reputation for
generat-ing “educationese”; in fact, one can purchase an
education “jargon generator”.</b></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"> 
<b>Government Departments generally
describe their role as one of “encouraging and supporting their
sectors”. The Department of Agriculture and Fisheries, for example,
describes its role as that of “advancing Prince Edward Island
primary industries and its approach to food development, production
and sales”. Our Department of Education, on the other hand, seems
to have adopted or been assigned a more limited role, that of
“developing and delivering high quality programs and curriculum in
English and French to Island children from birth to Grade 12” – a
narrow mandate for such a major field of service</b></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><b>Province
needs public statement of over-arching beliefs and guidelines that
set a framework for planning, developing and implementing educational
services. Given the number of Government Departments, institutions
and agencies delivering educational services including private
schools, such a document would inform the public, set the tone,
increase consistency and reduce red tape throughout the system. </b>

Or Product</b></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><b>Education
is a service industry, it delivers help to individuals who want to
change their behaviour.  Provincial governments pay for some services
because they know that higher levels of education are good for the
community as a whole. Because of this, front line service proviiders
need to be well trained and have a large measure of freedom to
respond to individual learner needs.</b></p>

- OVER RELIANCE ON SCHOOLS /SCHOOL FILTER</b></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><b>as
a vehicle for delivering instruction/ Failure to distinguish between
education a nd instruction; Seems strange that educators are sloppy
in their use of words.  I say this because of the practice of using
education and instruction (schooling) interchangeably.  We do not so
confuse agriculture and farming or health and hospitalization.  The
practice results in a serious distortion of the role of schools, adds
to the cost, bureaucratizes the service and is a stumbling block to
improvement.  It is unlike-ly that education will become the service
we deserve until we learn to define and de-scribe it better.</b></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><b>Educ
is a service delivered to individuals but frequently in a group
setting Failure to identify education functions and to organize
accordingly. Typically, the structure of organizations is based on
the dictum “form follows function” as the basis for of the
organizational structure. The Department seems to have ignored this
rule.  As a result, some services have been left out.</b></p>

that when teachers and principals have greater autonomy and
accountability, students generally achieve better grades, even when
standards living are considered.”  Autonomy, it seems, results in
higher levels of satisfaction among teachers, better serves students
with different learning styles, the article also points out that the
high level of pedagogical autonomy in Quebec increased autonomy and
accountability is sometimes credited with higher levels of

service providers assign an in-dividual to work with  client directly

role of Ieachers is to help others learn; when teachers rank their
students, they are 	putting their ability to teach at risk. Assigning
student grades, selecting 	students for prizes and awards and
awarding diplomas and degrees is a sorting 	process and should not be
part of a teacher’s role.  Apprenticeship with 	certification
through a Provincial Department of Labor and music through the 	Royal
Canadian Music Conservatory are examples of the recommended
