  February Memories
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Poignant poem about the death of Don&#x27;s sister Elinor (one of his 8 siblings). The narrative begins with a missed phone call where Elinor had called about a hall fire, followed weeks later by news of her illness and death from the flu. Don reflects on moving Elinor to a location twenty years earlier and witnessing the hearse carry her away from that same spot. The poem conveys deep sibling affection and demonstrates Don&#x27;s emotional sensitivity to family losses.</div>

<p><b>February Memories</b><b></b></p>
<p></p>
<p>My mind wanders back</p>
<p>Tonight as I sit</p>
<p>In my own living room</p>
<p>And I think back a bit</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>To one year ago</p>
<p>In the heart of the winter</p>
<p>Death entered the circle</p>
<p>And left with my sister</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>When I came home one night</p>
<p>I learned in our hall</p>
<p>I was a<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>few minutes too llalte</p>
<p>For her telephone call</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>She called to find out</p>
<p>About family and all</p>
<p>And to tell us the news</p>
<p>Of a bad fire at the hall</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I did not phone back</p>
<p>‘twas too late at night</p>
<p>In another few days</p>
<p>I would sit down and write</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Another week passed</p>
<p>Or perhaps it was two</p>
<p>Again the phone rang</p>
<p>Elinor, down with the flu</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>It was much worse than that</p>
<p>As I soon was to hear</p>
<p>Within a few days</p>
<p>Her life was no more</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Her family, her friends</p>
<p>They passed by her bier</p>
<p>Recalling good times</p>
<p>With a person so dear</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Soon it was over</p>
<p>We ech went our way</p>
<p>With our private memories</p>
<p>Of that sad, sad day</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I stand in the yyard</p>
<p>See the hearse drive away</p>
<p>The loss of that sister</p>
<p>Hit home on that day</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>In fact I had moved her</p>
<p>With all that they’d got</p>
<p>Some twenty years earlier</p>
<p>To that very spot</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>On leaving for home</p>
<p>Dhe stood at the door</p>
<p>Or out in the yard</p>
<p>And waved as we left</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>But today she was leaving</p>
<p>And I was still there</p>
<p>I stared unbelieving</p>
<p>In the crisp morning air</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Oft in the evening</p>
<p>My mind wanders back</p>
<p>To the many occasions</p>
<p>She gave me a snack</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>And we talked</p>
<p>And we laughed</p>
<p>As we talked of old times</p>
<p>Of family and friends</p>
<p>Of earlier times</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>But now<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>they are memories</p>
<p>To treasure and hold</p>
<p>They shall remain with me</p>
<p>To the days<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>when Im old</p>
<p><br></p>
