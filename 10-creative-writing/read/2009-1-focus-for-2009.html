<p><br></p>
<p><b>1	Background</b>:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Over the past few weeks, I have spoken with most committee members (and people who are not committee members).</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Committee is a forum for discussion of who, when, how, etc.</p>
<p>Original model foresaw committees including community members<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>No single approach for all contacts</p>
<p>While interested in numbers, main thing is to keep reaching out</p>
<p>Not limited to one on one contact; consider letters, group presentations, brochures,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>People give to people</p>
<p>Past donors are one of the best sources of additional donations</p>
