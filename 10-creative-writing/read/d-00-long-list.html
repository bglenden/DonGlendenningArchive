  D 00 Long list
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">This extensive brainstorming document catalogs dozens of educational initiatives under six strategic areas: Focus on Teaching, Challenge for Credit, Grade Improvement, Library-Based Services, Provincial Clinic, and Comprehensive Reform. Don synthesizes diverse concepts from educational research (including references to Pathways to Education from Globe and Mail). Proposals range from teacher competency identification to early childhood development to qualification authorities to summer programs. The &quot;First Steps Plan&quot; outlines ambitious systemic improvements including early childhood education reform, school performance focus, independent learning encouragement, and qualification authority establishment. This document reveals Don&#x27;s comprehensive educational vision and capacity for synthesizing complex ideas into actionable frameworks.</div>

<p><br></p>
<p><b>FIRST STEPS PLAN IMPROVING EDUCATION</b></p>
<p><b>1	EDUCATE BOTH YOUNG CHILDREN AND THEIR CAREGIVERS</b></p>
<p>Early childhood experiences, in a large measure. determine who we are and what we become; early childhood education, therefore, lays the foundation for both formal education.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Early childhood development differs from education in that it:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Because of the above, early childhood education should:<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></p>
<p>Focus on the family as well as the child</p>
<p>Be developmental rather than curricular</p>
<p>Be community based</p>
<p>Focus on the development of the whole child</p>
<p>Include diagnosis, assessment and prescription</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Not be delivered through schools</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Organizationally,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>3	FOCUS ON IMPROVING SCHOOL PERFORMANCE</b></p>
<p>Schools aew judged on the academic skills <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>acaFocus on learning teaching interface:</p>
<p>Teacher skills</p>
<p>variables controlled by teacher</p>
<p>Variables not controlled by teacher</p>
<p>Diagnosis and prescription</p>
<p>Reinforcement</p>
<p>Learning model</p>
<p>Certification</p>
<p>Reward improved perfprmance</p>
<p>Financial grants in support selected innovations are designed to allow and encourage people with ideas for improvement to experiment without jeopardizing their normal operating budget.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Any such support, however, would only be granted provided that it had the full support of the eisting administration and on the understanding that,if proven successful, would be incorporated into the ongoing operation of schools.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Potential projects include:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Early graduation</p>
<p>Individual tutoring for raising school grades</p>
<p>Challenge for credit</p>
<p>Common rating scale for reading</p>
<p>Teacher reporting</p>
<p>Performance based graduation standards<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>

<p>Tutoring for credit to allow learners meet he requirements for a higher grade in a chosen subject</p>
<p>Challenge for credit so that students are able to leave school early with credit earned.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p>Publish newsletter</p>
<p>Organize dialogues</p>
<p>Arrange presentations</p>
<p>Prepare media – releases, letters to the editor</p>
<p>Convene invitational workshops</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>6	ESTABLISH EXTERNAL QUALIFICATION AUTHORITY</p>
<p>An external assessment authority, not part of the public education system, to provide a formal assessment of what has been learned.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The authority would not issue credentials or qualifications as such but would, for a fee, provide individuals, institutions of higher education, certification and licensing bodies with unbiased results of a student’s performance.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This will both allow and encourage individuals of any age to study on their own and provide a simple and readily accessible system for receiving formal recognition.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The emphasis should be on what the individual knows and can do; whether or not that qualifies for acceptance into postsecondary education or employment should be determined by the receiving organization.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>t</p>
