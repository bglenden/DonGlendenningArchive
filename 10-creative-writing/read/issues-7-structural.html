  Issues-7 structural
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">This document provides foundational definitions and frameworks for understanding education systems. Don defines education as preparation for life&#x27;s roles and schooling as instruction delivered through institutions. He identifies typical education functions (policy/governance, instruction, human resources, products/technology, information/counselling, funding, quality assurance) and notes that PEI education services emerge from multiple government departments. Key structural issues include: lack of overarching public statements about education beliefs, narrow mandates for education departments, insufficient community engagement, politicization, and lack of clear accountability. He proposes delegating instruction to diverse providers (schools, colleges, universities, private practitioners, independent learners) and establishing independent qualification bodies separate from teaching roles.</div>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><b>It
is widely recognized that education is a key factor in determining
each citizen’s quality of life; in the same way, the collective
education of our citizens will determine to a significant degree the
quality of the communities in which we live.  In recognition of its
importance, governments provide massive support for public education.
The investment is justified for two reasons, one to ensure a high
level of personal growth and development for every citizen; the other
is to ensure the common good</b></p>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><b>An
education system is a set of services put in place by a community to
encourage and support the education of its citizens. Given the
numbers served and the wide range of  prior experience, capabilities
and interests of learners, designing and operating an education
system is no easy task.  While gaps in understanding are to be
expected, It seems to the writer that the gap between the providers
and users of educational services continues to widen. </b>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><b>Preparation
for life’s roles is called education and the better prepared we are
the better we are able to cope with all that we encounter, or create.
 Educating is a complex matter made so by the fact that each person
is unique in many ways, unique in basic physical, mental, emotional
make-up; unique in the range and nature of previous experience,
unique in perceived futures, but also unique in terms of learning
pace, style and needs.  One’s education is often described as any
experience that has a formative effect on the way we think, feel or
act; the nature and level of one’s education is demonstrated of as
what we can do with what we have learned.</b></p>

	<b>Overarching
	principles  - Province needs public statement of over-arching
	beliefs and guidelines that set a framework for planning, developing
	and implementing educational services. Given the number of
	Government Departments, institutions and agencies delivering
	educational services including private schools, such a document
	would inform the public, set the tone, increase consistency and

	<b>Clear
	mandate - Limited mandate given to or assumed by the Department of
	Education.  Government Departments generally describe their role as
	one of  “encouraging and supporting their sectors”. The
	Department of Agriculture and Fisheries, for example, describes its
	role as that of “advancing Prince Edward Island primary industries
	and its approach to food development, production and sales”. The
	Department of Education, on the other hand, “develops and delivers
	high quality programs and curriculum in English and French to Island
	children from birth to Grade 12” – a narrow mandate for such a

	<b>a “clear

	statement does not currently exist for PEI. We believe that having
	such a statement is required, especially for a service as large and
	complex as education, however, we are not suggesting another study
	but rather a document prepared by a small working with opportunity

	<b>Engagement
	with community served - Availability of information.  Souris
	residents pointed out the need for more and better information about

a qualification body for the purpose certifying individual levels of
	achievement to persons wanting or needing such documentation.  The
role of 	teachers is to help others learn; when teachers rank their
students they are 	putting their ability to teach at risk. Assigning
student grades, selecting 	students for prizes and awards and
awarding diplomas and degrees is a sorting 	process and should not be
part of a teacher’s role.  Apprenticeship with 	certification
through a Provincial Department of Labour and music through the
	Royal Canadian Music Conservatory are examples of the recommended
	arrangement.</b></p>
