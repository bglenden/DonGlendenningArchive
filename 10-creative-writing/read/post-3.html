<div class="reader-summary">This incomplete but insightful piece addresses Don&#x27;s persistent frustration with conflating education and schooling. He defines education as &quot;an experience that has a formative effect on the way we think feel or act,&quot; emphasizing it as a personal change process occurring across diverse contexts and relationships. The distinction matters crucially: schools organize directed learning experiences, but education extends far beyond institutional boundaries. He notes that much early education occurs in homes and families, with schools playing a supplementary role. The piece critiques misleading appropriation of &quot;education&quot; terminology by schools.</div>

<p>My brother-in-law used to delight in telling stories about the impeccable grammar of teachers of English, especially about the use of “I” and “me”.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My frustration, however, comes from the failure of people, especially educators, to distinguish between education and schooling.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The most recent being a question from a new friend about where I got my education; it turned out, what he really wanted to know was where I went to university.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>On the one hand, when I think of a person pursuing or getting an education, I think of someone gaining new skills, acquiring new information or changing an attitude.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Education in this sense is a very personal process of bringing about change.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In fact, my personal glossary<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>defines educaton as an experience that has a formative effect on the way we think feel or act.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That would include adding new skills, knowledge or attitudes as well as improving the ones we already have.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Educational experiences can occur at any time or place with or without a the involvement of another person.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>A major part of a person’s education occurs in the early years and within the context of the home and extended family but some.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Some of our learning experiences happened in schools and under the direction, or influence of a teacher, a person paid to help; while schools emphasize the growth or change of knowledge, experience affecting attitude and skills also are organized. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p>So, what’s the problem.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There are a couple.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>First, misleadingschools have appropriated<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
