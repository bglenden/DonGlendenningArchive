  D-3 We are all educated
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">This inclusive piece challenges narrow definitions of education, asserting that all humans continuously educate themselves through diverse experiences: learning to talk, ride bikes, drive cars, conduct research, design buildings, create art, or advance technology. Don broadens education beyond schooling to encompass skill development, information acquisition, attitude change, and confidence building. He positions schools as playing a special role but not the only role in education, reflecting his holistic understanding that learning is a lifelong, multifaceted process occurring across all life contexts and experiences.</div>

<p><b>We are all educated</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>We are all educated; meaning that we have all learned something.</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>At birth, we are all catapulted onto the road of life – and we are there as long as we live. We gurgle, say mama, learn to ride a bike, read a book and drive a car.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In my books, that’s all part of one’s education; so is learning to do research, design a building, creating a piece of art or put a human on Mars.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Improving one’s education is as simple as learning new information, sometimes it is simply gaining new information, other times it involves new involves gaining new skills and other times it involves changing our attitudes – learning self- confidence or the give and take of friendships – but it is all education.</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>We add to our education every time we travel, make a new friend, play a new game, improve our communication skills read a book and the list goes on. Schools play a special role in gaining an education, but I’ll save that for another blog.</b></p>
