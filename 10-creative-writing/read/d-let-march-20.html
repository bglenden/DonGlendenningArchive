<div class="reader-summary">A letter criticizing PEI Department of Education and Lifelong Learning for conflating &quot;education&quot; (umbrella concept) with &quot;instruction&quot; (schooling). Don argues the Department&#x27;s narrow role of &quot;developing and delivering programs to young people&quot; contrasts unfavorably with other departments&#x27; broader mandates and ignores individual and community needs across lifespans. He proposes government should fund diverse individual services (literacy, numeracy, employment prep) and community services, noting comparative examples from health care. The letter reflects his recurring theme about fundamental definitional and structural confusion in education policy.</div>

<p>March 20, 2020</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Dear Editor: <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Communication: a key to improvement in education</p>
<p>To views of education</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>It appears that the PEI Department of Education and Lifelong Learning does not distinguish between education, an umbrella term, and “instruction” (schooling)– a service provided mostly in schools. The Department implies that going to school and getting an education are the same; World Bank reports disagree.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The Department of Education and Lifelong Learning describes its role as one of developing and delivering “high quality programs and curriculum in English and French to Island children from birth to Grade 12.”; that is a continuation of role adopted by the previous government.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>It seems a narrow role as compared to the Department of Fisheries and Communities that “advocates on behalf of the marine fishery and the aquaculture industries’ or the Department of Agriculture and Land which works to ”advance Prince Edward Island's primary industries and its approach to food development, production and sales.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Or the Department of Health with is “delivery of publicly funded health services in PEI. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>.. The Government’s role is to encourage, support and regulate. It’s provision of services should be equiabl. We should rethink this view.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Education is a service to both individuals and communitiest</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Instead of funding schools, it should fund services for individuals such<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>as: Literacy</p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li4">Numeracy</li>
  <li class="li4">Self care</li>
  <li class="li4">Employment preparation</li>
  <li class="li4">Interpersonal relations</li>
</ul>
<p>And service for communities</p>
<p>Funding levels may vary: full cost of literacy and numeracy, full cost of a full year of art and career training; full<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>cost of 17 police officers half the cost of one PhD in any field. Monthly fees<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>50 days of training in your specialty<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>every five years</p>
<p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Don Glendenning</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Information is an important education service in its own right and deserves its own recognition; it should separated other functions and made widely available to all stakeholders .<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I came to this realization, based in part, because of time spent over the last year in hospital corridors and health treatment rooms. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We, in education, have much to learned from the delivery of health care<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
