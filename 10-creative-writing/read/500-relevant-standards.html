  500 Relevant Standards
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Don addresses the gap between public expectations and school delivery, citing Common Core State Standards and Ontario&#x27;s Provincial Report Card as incomplete responses. He argues &quot;exit standards&quot; are the pressing issue—defining expected growth levels from schooling. Don defines standards as three-component constructs: criteria (dimensions like vocabulary, style, grammar), rating scales (6-level example for writing from disorganized to creatively written), and benchmarks (industry-recognized reference points like a competent plumber who solves problems independently). He notes doctors use test results without averaging to determine patient health, while teachers average diverse subjects&#x27; grades—an illogical analogy. Don argues judgment cannot be removed from standards-setting, only made consistent, as doctors exemplify through using test results to inform judgment about treatment.</div>

<p><b>Relevant Standards</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>A gap exists between what the public expects of schools and what schools deliver; the two do not speak the same language.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Two recent reports, a US report on <span>Common Core State Standards</span> and the Ontario <span>Provincial Report Card</span> address the gap but both, in my view, are still works in progress.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If working models exist, they have not come into my view - at least not yet.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In my view, exit standards is the pressing issue of the day.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>By standards, I refer to the level of growth attributed to being in school.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Standard:	A standard is a level of performance expected of a service or product</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>A standard has three components:</p>
<p>Criteria are the factors against which we measure.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Criteria for evaluating writing, for example, may include:</p>
<p>Vocabulary</p>
<p>Style</p>
<p>Use of reference	</p>
<p>Sentence structure</p>
<p>Creativity</p>
<p>Grammar,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>2	A rating scale describes levels of performance; the scale for writing shows six levels:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>6	Creatively written whiled observing acceptable standards of grammar, sentence structure and organization.</p>
<p>5 	Very well organized showing precise and wide vocabulary, good sentence structure and appropriate grammar and some creativity.</p>
<p>4 	Organized with few errors in grammar and sentence structure,</p>
<p>3 	Organized with acceptable grammar and sentence structure.</p>
<p>2 	Generally organized but shows limited vocabulary and significant errors in grammar and sentence structure.</p>
<p>1 	Disorganized and unfocused with many errors in grammar and sentence structure accompanied by a limited vocabulary.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>3	A benchmark is a level of performance which is widely recognized by practitioners and which serves as the reference point. A benchmark anchors a standard in reality.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A benchmark for reading could be as simple as the ability to read and discuss articles in the daily paper. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>An average, competent or skilled plumber is “a person who comes to your house and can usually fix the plumbing problem without having to call or return to the shop. “<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Although we may be able to remove judgment from the testing process, we cannot remove judgment from the standards process.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>To use an example from the health field, a doctor subjects a patient to a variety of tests, then makes a judgment as to the next course of action.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The answer lies, not in the removal of judgment but in its consistency. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
