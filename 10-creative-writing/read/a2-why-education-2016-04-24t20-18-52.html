<p><i>About Education</i></p>
<p><i>You and your education</i></p>

<p><b>When we are young, in fact at any age, we are told that we should “get an education”; sounds like a good idea but where does one I get it and how? And how do I know when I have it?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I really do not want to go to school?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If you are reading this or talking about it with friends, you already have an education, so you’ve got to be a bit more specific.</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>The word “education” is used in a number of ways:</b></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li6"><b>In terms of what one knows and is able to do – he can fix anything</b></li>
  <li class="li6"><b>Number of years of formal schooling and/or credentials held – she has a Master’s degree in Nursing.</b></li>
  <li class="li6"><b>Formal qualifications – an “iron ring” meaning a professional engineer.</b></li>
  <li class="li6"><b>A department of government that has been designated to oversee the education function in a political jurisdiction</b></li>
  <li class="li6"><b>An economic sector</b></li>
</ul>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>When speaking about a person, your education is reflected in the things that you learned to do since you were born; I happen to like the one about education being </b>any experience that has a formative effect on the way a person thinks feels or acts.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Formative means that what you’ve learned has changed you.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>So if you can walk,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>talk, listen, eat your meals and skate or ride a bicycle, tell time you’ve got a good start with your education.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The key to education is change; becoming educated means that you can now things you couldn’t do before. You don’t necessarily mean that you do all the things that you can do but it does mean that you are able to do them.</p>
<p>Growing is a type of change but not part of learning; the learning comes into play when you learn how to deal with your new size, your weight loss, or loss of hair.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>So, do I change if I read a book?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That’s a definite maybe; if you learned a new word, or it helps you ride your bike better or even to visualize Calcutta could be learning.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In fact, we usually think of learning<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>as something that changes the way we</p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li6">Think meaning that we have more information on which to make decisions, more experience in doing something over and over again or even on your own<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li6">feel meaning we are more confident in ourselves or don’t get angry as often, or we are more venturesome, or<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li6">act meaning that we can do something we couldn’t do before.</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Education is about:</p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li9">Covering all the standards</li>
  <li class="li10">Improving performance on government tests</li>
  <li class="li10">Meeting AYP (Adequate Yearly Progress)</li>
  <li class="li10">Producing a competitive workforce</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>But I thought that you go to school to get an education.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>While formal study in schools, colleges and universities is important, you would have an education whethere or not you go to school.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Educarion is made up of all our experiences at home, at church, in the various community groups we belong to, through travel and on the job and through self study .<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In fact, in the broader scheme of life, formal education, or at least the part we measure, is one of the sectors of least importance. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
