  500 Teachers as Change Agents
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Don defines teachers as change agents helping learners acquire behaviors for adult community participation, arguing content is the easy part. Learning, he states, is change—in cognitive, affective, or psychomotor domains. Learning is fundamentally individual; teachers don&#x27;t teach classes but may teach multiple individuals within group settings. Teaching involves stimulating learning through diverse techniques: modeling, information delivery, questioning, timelines, projects, field trips, and assessment. The crux of good teaching is creating individual learning environments that yield favorable experiences. Don notes subjects serve as media for teaching broader skills—English teaches communication, school environment teaches citizenship. Good assessment focuses on what people actually do in real life: communicate, solve problems, discuss literature, analyze situations, not on memorizing isolated content.</div>

<p>Teachers are change agents.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They help learners gain a set of behaviours needed to participate in adult community.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Content is the easy part.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>To learn is to change; to teach is to help others change.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In educational jargon, changes may be in the cognitive, affective or psychomotor domains.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>More simply put, a person who has learned has new or changed attitudes, skills or information or some combination thereof. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Learning is an individual matter.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Only the learner can learn.<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>The stimulus for learning may be internal or external and the actual learning may take place in a group setting or when the individual is alone.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A teacher does not teach a class but a teacher may teach individuals at the same time in a group setting. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The role of a teacher is to stimulate learning – to create a set of circumstances so that a learner learns the desired behaviour. To help a learner to learn is to help bring about changes in the learner.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Teachers need a variety of techniques in their tool kit – and they will likely require all of them.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Tools include setting an example, providing information, asking questions, setting time lines, assigning projects or home work, organizing field trips and assessing performance.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The trick for each teacher is to create a learning environment for each learner that will result in each learner having a favorable experience, even in a group setting.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Not easy but it is the crux of good teaching.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Teachers use subjects as a medium for teaching; most any subject serves as a medium through which to teach communication skills; perhaps the school environment is the best medium for teaching citizenship.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Most subjects can be used as a medium for teaching a number of skills.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Teachers use a variety of methods to both motivate and teach students assigned to their care such as having students take tests and exams, prepares course papers, participates in discussions and group activities, field trips.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>One cannot measure English, Literature or chemistry one can, however, measure one ability to communicate in a language, ones ability to solve problems, discuss great authors, summarize events, ability to analyze a situation and draw conclusions, etc.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This is what people do in real life.</p>
