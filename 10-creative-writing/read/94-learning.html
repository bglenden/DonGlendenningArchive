  94 Learning
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Don presents his philosophy of learning as personal, multi-faceted change in how people think, feel, and act. He stresses that learners carry three types of baggage into learning situations: innate conditions, prior learning, and aspirations about the future. Criticizing PEI&#x27;s narrow focus on school-based education, he argues institutions must redesign programs to accommodate diverse learner needs and that educators must engage as professionals with communities they serve, not remain confined by political filters and bureaucratic constraints. His vision emphasizes that meaningful education develops lifelong competencies beyond credentialing.</div>

<p><b>IT’S ABOUT LEARNING</b></p>
<p><b>Learning is about people making change in their lives; more precisely it’s about changes in the way they<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>think, feel and act. Learning is a very personal matter; only learners can learn – in other words one person cannot learn for another person.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Learning itself is neutral, neither<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>good nor bad.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It’s value depends on the purpose for which learning is used.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>While groups do not learn,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>learning can take place in a group setting – in fact, some learning experiences require the participation of others. Learning can happen anywhere; the World Bank says the moot important part of learning is the part a child takes to school.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Departments of Education favour learning that takes place in schools; in fact, some people<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>believe that going to school and getting an education are the same thing.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The World Bank find this to be an issue in developing countries,</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Learners have individual learning styles and rates.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is said that each learner carries three pieces of baggage to each new learning situation:</b></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li8"><b>Certain physical, mental and emotional conditions with which they were born:</b></li>
  <li class="li8"><b>Prior learning resulting from formal study, home circumstances, travel, state of health, personal interests, culture and learning styles.</b></li>
  <li class="li8"><b>Aspirations and imagined future including where one will live, one’s lifestyle and likely work, nature of family, quality of life, etc.</b></li>
</ul>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Given the uniqueness of individuals, institutions shouldbe redesifning and redeveloping learning to accommodate emerging changes. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>

<p>Islanders want our students to be literate and numerate, to become independent learners, to take care of themselves and learn how to work and play together. Education’s business is to help Islanders gain new and better skills, knowledge, attitudes and values.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We wonder if<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>our students would benefit from holistic rating scales, competency based learning, self- paced programs self-assessment and schools operating on democratic principles. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>We believe that education is central to the future of our citizens and our community.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Educators need to engage and collaborate with the community they serve The current conversation, however,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>is politically filterd and often bogged down on matters of administrivia (school upgrading, credits, grades, noon meals, technology, etc.) at the expense of changes that help Islanders gain knowledge, skills, attitudes and values needed to help them to thrive in later life.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>It is the writer’s view that much of the needed change is blocked (perhaps not encouraged is more accurate) by an outdated system<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>embedded in a body that can give it neither<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The direction, freedom nor support needed to accomplish the task at hand.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Government not only needs to change a number of existing policies and practices but also needs to allow, nay encourage,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>change to happen.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The World Bank recently chided Ministries of Education for not upgrading their own operation and<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>for with holding autonomy from schools.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>PEI has some 150,000 citizens; all are potential users of educational services. Their need’ s, interests and capabilities are many and varied, but policy documents are focused on providing services to young people through schools. It’s as though the only education that counts is the part provided o young people in schools. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Education needs a plan, something simple, some definitions, some guiding principles, description of services to be offered, services covered by government, and an organization that reflects the task at hand.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Such a statement should be short, sharp and developed with public input – but not by outside experts.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Education is a recognized profession, it is time to allow them to enter the fray as professionals in their own right and not to be subject to a political filter..<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p>We know that money is needed for buses. buildings, salaries and technology but please tell us how spending those dollars improves education</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>A recent report by the World Bank called attention to the fact going to school and getting an education are different functions and should not be confused.(World Bank – 2018)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I was actually asked a number of years ago on PEI, where I got my education; it turned out the person really wanted to know where I went to school.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I suspect that that view is widely held; my personal experience suggests that many Islanders, including<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>professional educators, fail to differentiate.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Communities believe that some kinds of learning are good for individuals and good for the community in which they live. They not only encourage that kind of learning but they help pay for it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Because medical doctors, mechanics and policemen are needed to ensure people are safe, they often pay for that also</p>
