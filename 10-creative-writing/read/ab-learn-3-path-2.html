<div class="reader-summary">Collaborative learning framework document developed with youth panel discussing learning processes. Panel identified 16+ learning activities (gathering information, lectures, counseling, demonstrations, tasks, assessment, motivation, observation, resources, reflection, feedback, instruction, self-evaluation, coaching, practice). Document notes learners follow different paths through these activities depending on goals and preferences. Includes chart mapping support useful at different learning stages respecting diverse learning styles. Credits Tanya Craig for panel convening and Mike Chapman for design.</div>

<p><b><i>Learning path			<span class="Apple-converted-space">     			</span></i></b></p>
<p>AB Learn-3			 					<span class="Apple-converted-space">                </span>November6, 2014</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The first step in understanding education is to understand learning and the learning process.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>So, what do we know about learning.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>First of all learning is an individual matter; only the learner can learn.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>To learn is to change behaviour; a person who has learned has new knowledge a new skill or a different attitude. Learning involves engaging in an experience that has a formative effect on a person.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>To better understand the learning process, Education 20/20 invited a panel of young people to tell us how they went about learning and what kinds of things they found most helpful.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Key words were listed on a flip chart; the list was long, however, on further discussion the panel members settled on the following steps they took the learning path:</p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li6"></li>
  <li class="li6">Gather Information			</li>
  <li class="li6">Attend lecture				</li>
  <li class="li6">Seek counselling			</li>
  <li class="li6">Observe demonstration			</li>
  <li class="li6">Attempt task				</li>
  <li class="li6">Undergo assessment			</li>
  <li class="li6">Motivate self</li>
  <li class="li6">Observe others</li>
  <li class="li6">Use resource material</li>
  <li class="li6">Reflect on experience			</li>
  <li class="li6">Take diagnosis				</li>
  <li class="li6">Obtain feedback			</li>
  <li class="li6">Take instruction</li>
  <li class="li6">Self evaluate</li>
  <li class="li6">Coach others</li>
  <li class="li6">Practice</li>
  <li class="li6"></li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p>Next, students were asked the order in which they took those steps; we founf, not surprisingly, that they followed quite different paths.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As an example one student said his first step would be to Google the topic; another said if it involved a new skill, he would probably attempt it first, while others liked the traditional lecture as a place to start.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Since panel members were in school or recent graduates, much of the discussion revolved around gaining new knowledge rather than skills or attitudes.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>It also became evident that different purposes for learning did not substantially change the help required, different purposes may well make the path longer.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Although not part of the original discussion, we’ve added the manner of recognition likely to occur at the close of the learning cycle.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The chart on the back of this page reflects an attempt to chart the support that students found useful and to do so in a manner that would respect all learning styles.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It’s our first attempt.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We think that it is a good start, but it is only a start.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We would welcome your input into making it better.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
