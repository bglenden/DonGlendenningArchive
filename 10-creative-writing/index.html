This comprehensive document identifies nine interconnected structural issues in education systems, with emphasis on PEI. Don argues that education—complex and individualized—requires clear definitions and systemic alignment. Issues identified: (1) Clarity—lack of definition and shared understanding, perpetuating &quot;educationese&quot; jargon; (2) Purpose—PEI&#x27;s stated purposes lack necessary detail for program development and assessment; (3) Education versus schooling—fundamental definitional confusion confuses roles and increases costs; (4) Structure—failing to organize around identified functions, particularly administrative and instructional services; (5) Autonomy and accountability—insufficient educator autonomy limiting responsiveness to diverse learner needs, despite OECD research showing autonomy improves outcomes; (6) Personalization—calendar-driven delivery ignores individual learner needs and interests; (7) Government relationship—political operation of education systems introduces inefficiency and instability; (8) Quality assurance—tension between teaching and grading roles; (9) Human and social capital—isolation of teachers prevents collaborative culture. Don advocates for systemic conversation and structural reorganization (dated June 5, 2023).<div class="expanded-tags"><span class="badge badge-low">EDUCATION</span> <span class="badge badge-low">PROFESSIONAL</span></div><div class="expanded-file"><a href="read/issues-3-education.html">Read</a> · <a href="files/Issues-3%20Education.doc">Download</a></div></div></td>

Don notes the poem has haunted him since he started teaching, suggesting its profound commentary on education&#x27;s limitations and disconnect from real-world impact on troubled youth. The adapted poem appears to reflect Don&#x27;s broader educational philosophy that teaching technical skills alone is insufficient without addressing underlying human needs.<div class="expanded-tags"><span class="badge badge-low">PROFESSIONAL</span></div><div class="expanded-file"><a href="read/90-i-taught-them-all.html">Read</a> · <a href="files/90%20I%20Taught%20them%20all.docx">Download</a></div></div></td>

He notes individual learner pace and style differences conflict with group-based instruction organized in time blocks, complicating diploma awards and graduation ceremonies. Don proposes five alternatives: schools focus on learning, not grading; independent bodies award grades; learning time adjusts to individual pace; graduation requirements change; Canadian Qualification Authority established; graduation becomes &quot;recognition.&quot; The article references an education award program and discusses information as an education service separate from instruction. Don&#x27;s personal reflection on an eye doctor&#x27;s &quot;Cataract Information for Patients&quot; pamphlet raises whether comparable patient/learner information services exist, and a concluding poem lament reflects on teaching effectiveness when students face social challenges.<div class="expanded-tags"><span class="badge badge-low">ANECDOTE</span> <span class="badge badge-low">CREATIVE_WRITING</span> <span class="badge badge-low">EDUCATION</span></div><div class="expanded-file"><a href="read/8-graduation.html">Read</a> · <a href="files/8%20Graduation.docx">Download</a></div></div></td>

Reflects on his own ZX81/BBC Micro generation and contemporary computing power differential. Britain&#x27;s computing tradition (Alan Turing, Tim Berners-Lee, 1980s home computer boom) faded in 1990s as education focused on Word documents rather than building. New computing curriculum begins September 2014 with coding at IT education center. Coding teaches &quot;computational thinking&quot;—problem-solving approach combining mathematics, logic, algorithms—applicable beyond software engineering to mechanical engineering, physics, biology, business analysis. Year of Code initiative aims to teach every British schoolchild to code next school year, training teachers, promoting coding culture through diverse leadership (computer scientists, entrepreneurs, business leaders).

Don identifies key discrepancies: client-centeredness versus content delivery, achievement versus time spent, teaching versus instructing, spiral versus linear curriculum, and coaches versus referee models for teachers. The document reinforces absence of market mechanisms creating perverse incentives and critiques the monopoly structure preventing outsourcing, credit for external learning, or independent assessment. Non-educational activities (ranking, transportation, fundraising, competitive sports, day care) are identified as distraction from core educational mission.

The document notes that countries with greater school autonomy over curriculum and assessment tend to show better student performance, especially when coupled with public accountability (posting achievement data). Conversely, autonomy without accountability measures correlates with worse performance. Don proposes specific poll questions: whether respondents favor greater school autonomy in daily operations and whether schools should post PISA results publicly.

The document catalogs the system&#x27;s basics (ages 6-16 compulsory attendance, September-June calendar), characteristics (state-run monopoly with limited participation), service gaps, and system weaknesses including focus on post-secondary preparation, diffused accountability, poorly defined standards, limited public input, outdated delivery model, and lack of coordination.

Teaching involves stimulating learning through diverse techniques: modeling, information delivery, questioning, timelines, projects, field trips, and assessment. The crux of good teaching is creating individual learning environments that yield favorable experiences.

This document analyzes why education systems are slow to adapt to changing conditions, comparing education to other institutional sectors (health, justice, religion, hospitality). Don identifies five characteristic categories affecting change resistance: autonomy, clarity, accountability, structure, and culture. He then catalogs contemporary issues across K-12 and higher education: higher education faces student debt, completion rates, mental health, accreditation questions; K-12 confronts funding, safety, discipline, technology, charter school debates, standardized testing, teacher salaries, bullying, poverty, class size. Structural barriers include unclear purpose, limited autonomy, undefined accountability, inadequate reward systems, and risk-averse culture. Additional issues span health/wellness, equity, governance relationships, and resource adequacy. This document reveals Don&#x27;s systematic thinking about institutional change barriers and his comprehensive understanding of contemporary education challenges at multiple system levels.<div class="expanded-tags"><span class="badge badge-low">SYSTEMIC_CHANGE</span> <span class="badge badge-low">INSTITUTIONAL_BARRIERS</span> <span class="badge badge-low">K_12_EDUCATION</span> <span class="badge badge-low">HIGHER_EDUCATION</span> <span class="badge badge-low">CONTEMPORARY_ISSUES</span></div><div class="expanded-file"><a href="read/issues-4.html">Read</a> · <a href="files/Issues-4.docx">Download</a></div></div></td>
