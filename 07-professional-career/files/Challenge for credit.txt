External Credentialing Directive 


Pursuant to section 7, 8 and 52 of the School Act R.S.P.E.I. 1988, Cap. S-2-1, 
I hereby issue the following Minister’s Directive concerning External Credentialing 

1. POLICY STATEMENT The External Credentialing Directive will acknowledge the value of student learning outside the public school system by recognizing for high school credit, credentials obtained outside of regular school instructional time by an education service agency external 
to the public school system. External high school credit will be awarded for courses, programs, or assessments that have been evaluated and that match or exceed provincial high school standards. External credentials must contribute to the Essential Graduation Learnings, and must meet the standards defined in this directive. External credentials will be reflected on the student’s high school transcript, thereby enhancing he 
transcript fr the student. Although students are entitled to receive credit as set out below, the Department of Education and Early Childhood Development assumes no liability, financial or otherwise, for students who enroll in courses, programs, or assessments offered by other jurisdictions or institutions.

DIRECTIVES 
Granting

• 
External

may 
be 
granted 
in 
grades 
10, 
11, 
and

• 
External

may 
be 
equivalent 
to

• 
Within 
the 
20 
credits 
(English 
school 
system) 
or 
25

(French 
school 
system) 
a 
high 
school 
student 
requires 
for 
graduation, 
one 
non-compulsory 
credit 
can 
be 
an 
external 
credential. 
• 
An 
external 
credential 
cannot 
be 
used 
to 
fulfill 
a 
student’s 
requirement 
for 
the 
10 
(English 
school 
system) 
or 
15 
(French 
school 
system) 
compulsory 
credits. 
• 
Credit 
restriction 
shall 
apply 
for 
external 
credentials 
where 
the 
courses, 
programs, 
or 
assessments 
are 
deemed 
to 
be 
equivalent 
to 
those 
offered 
in 
the 
Prince 
Edward 
Island 
High 
School 
Program 
of 
Studies 
or 
a 
local 
program 
offered 
at 
the 
school 
level. 
This 
means 
students 
shall 
not 
be 
eligible 
for 
an 
elective 
credit 
for 
such 
external 
credential 
courses, 
programs, 
or 
assessments. 
• 
Students 
registered 
in 
the 
French 
school 
system 
who 
earn 
external 
credential(s) 
must 
do 
so 
in 
the 
French 
language. 
If 
the 
program 
through 
which 
the 
external 
credential 
is 
earned 
is 
not 
available 
in 
the 
French 
language, 
consideration 
will 
be 
given 
on 
an 
individual 
student 
basis. 
• 
Students 
may 
use 
one 
grade 
12-level 
external 
credential 
as 
an 
elective 
credit 
towards 
the 
required 
number 
of 
grade 
12 
credits 
for 
graduation. 
• 
Students 
who 
have 
earned 
an 
approved 
external 
credential 
prior 
to 
entering 
grade 
10 
may 
be 
awarded 
credit 
for 
that 
external 
credential 
if 
they 
present 
evidence 
of 
their 
credential 
any 
time 
after 
they 
enter 
grade 
10. 
• 
A 
student 
may 
earn 
an 
unlimited 
number 
of 
credits, 
including 
external 
credentials, 
beyond 
the 
20 
credits 
(English 
school 
system) 
or 
25 
credits 
(French 
school 
system) 
required 
for 
graduation. 
However, 
there 
are 
credit 
restrictions 
between 
external 
credentials 
where 
the 
courses, 
programs, 
or 
assessments 
are 
deemed 
to 
be 
equivalent 
by 
the 
External 
Credentialing 
Advisory 
Committee. 
• 
Although 
external 
credentials 
may 
contribute 
towards 
graduation 
requirements, 
they 
may 
or 
may 
not 
meet 
general 
or 
specific 
admission 
requirements 
for 
post-secondary 
institutions. 
It 
is 
the 
responsibility 
of 
students 
to 
verify 
admissions 
requirements 
for 
the 
post-secondary 
institution 
they 
plan 
to 
attend. 
• 
Only 
those 
external 
credentials 
that 
have 
been 
reviewed 
and 
approved 
by 
the 
Minister 
of 
Education 
and 
Early 
Childhood 
Development 
can 
be 
included 
on 
the 
student 
transcript 
as
