Don Glendenning presents a detailed analysis of structural issues requiring public dialogue about education&#x27;s future in PEI. He emphasizes that education is fundamentally complex due to learner diversity, and systems require clear purposes, functions, and structures. Key issues: (1) Terminology—educators use single terms for multiple concepts without definitions, conflating education with schooling; (2) Purpose—PEI&#x27;s purpose statements lack detail needed for development and assessment; (3) Structure—failing to organize around identified functions; (4) Autonomy—OECD research shows schools with operational autonomy achieve better PISA results; (5) Accountability—requires defining missions, values, goals, and ensuring transparent communication; (6) Standards and grading—conflicts arise when teachers both teach and grade; competency reporting preferred; (7) Human and social capital—isolated teachers lack collaborative culture. Don advocates moving from product-focused (credentials) to service-focused education, and calls for public engagement in systemic change, extending an invitation to Islanders (June 5, 2023).<div class="expanded-tags"><span class="badge badge-low">EDUCATION</span></div><div class="expanded-file"><a href="read/issues-7-education.html">Read</a> · <a href="files/Issues-7%20Education.doc">Download</a></div></div></td>

The draft demonstrates Glendenning&#x27;s commitment to integrating youth voice into educational advocacy and creating inclusive forums where both formal governance and community dialogue occur simultaneously.<div class="expanded-tags"><span class="badge badge-low">CORRESPONDENCE</span> <span class="badge badge-low">EDUCATION</span></div><div class="expanded-file"><a href="read/draft-invitation-2.html">Read</a> · <a href="files/Draft%20invitation-2.docx">Download</a></div></div></td>

Includes Don&#x27;s core beliefs about learner-centered delivery, distinguishing education from schooling, mathematics as prerequisite for opportunity, and need for external qualification authorities.

This version distills key findings: current education lacks recognized subject analysis and separates teaching from assessment functions. Don proposes a systematic approach using mathematics as a pilot: analyze the field, identify proficiency levels, produce assessment models, and establish independent assessment bodies. Services would be independent of schools, employers, and government; non-competitive; and confidential. The document cites successful existing models (Apprenticeship Red Seal, Red Cross Swim Program, Royal Canadian Conservatory of Music) demonstrating that subject-specific proficiency certification is viable and beneficial.<div class="expanded-tags"><span class="badge badge-low">EDUCATION</span></div><div class="expanded-file"><a href="read/8-math-levels.html">Read</a> · <a href="files/8%20Math%20levels%20.docx">Download</a></div></div></td>

Don argues individuals differ in experiences, interests, learning styles; choice-making is an important educational skill; individuals should take responsibility for choices; consumer choices drive service improvement. Contrasts limited educational choice with choice available in other sectors (church, professional services). References Bay County (Florida) School Authority 2005 open enrollment example. Proposes four choice dimensions: School choice (location), teacher choice (chemistry between teacher and student), scheduling choice (flexibility in time spent in school), and graduation date choice (based on competency not age). Argues choice removes excuses, increases accountability, and creates window of opportunity for system transformation. Notes Alberta&#x27;s variety of school types (public, private, charter, religious, specialty arts/hockey) all open to residents. Emphasizes that most other services are similarly limited in small communities, so rural constraints shouldn&#x27;t prevent choice.

Accountability represents &quot;the process of making, keeping and managing promises and expectations… being liable or answerable for overall outcomes.&quot; Applying this to schools, Don argues teachers are responsible for ensuring students learn, while principals as instructional leaders are accountable for students gaining skills needed for postsecondary education or employment. Students and parents also bear responsibility for school success. The bilingual issue includes discussion of professional development, highlighting James Kempton&#x27;s argument for teacher-controlled continuing education (100 hours annually) modeled on Royal College standards rather than school-mandated in-service days that research shows have limited impact.

Don cautions that while PISA provides useful feedback and international comparison, test results should not drive all educational decisions. He highlights an OECD survey of 11 participating countries showing that schools with greater autonomy tend to perform better on PISA. Critically, Don notes that when schools account publicly for results through achievement data, greater autonomy correlates with better performance, but without accountability arrangements, autonomous schools can perform worse. This balanced perspective reflects Don&#x27;s sophisticated understanding of educational governance. The newsletter reminds readers of the January 20 workshop on youth preparedness and directs readers to OECD resources. Don recommends the Vancouver Sun article on British Columbia school report card reforms.<div class="expanded-tags"><span class="badge badge-low">EDUCATION</span></div><div class="expanded-file"><a href="read/11-pisa-again.html">Read</a> · <a href="files/11%20PISA%20again.docx">Download</a></div></div></td>

Discusses trade-offs between Dr. Scott Morris&#x27;s advice to prioritize content speed over perfection versus Don&#x27;s position that week-by-week delivery demands professional production. Emphasizes importance of engaging delivery: &quot;if a lesson in class isn&#x27;t engaging, you might still hold attention through classroom presence; a boring home lesson faces hundreds of distractions.&quot; Reflects that educators should maintain same quality standards for students as expected from students.

Glendenning catalogs the extensive control systems schools maintain: determining students&#x27; departure times, bus behavior, lunch schedules, subject choices, room assignments, exam timing, and departure times. Teachers face comparable controls. He argues schools operate on obsolete industrial organizational models while other sectors have evolved. The document advocates learner-centered education beginning with educational assessment, permanent educational advisors (like family doctors), and individual learning plans—contrasting this with current group-based instruction assuming same-age students need identical lessons. He criticizes both bureaucratic control and the lack of individual attention in mass education.<div class="expanded-tags"><span class="badge badge-low">ANECDOTE</span></div><div class="expanded-file"><a href="read/educational-bureaucracy.html">Read</a> · <a href="files/Educational%20Bureaucracy.doc">Download</a></div></div></td>

Don credits DACUM&#x27;s strength to its practitioner-based approach and escape from academic semantics in favor of life-based, occupation-specific competencies. He describes CRSP as providing personalized, competency-based, and computer-assisted learning within flexible structures. NZQA&#x27;s framework demonstrates how to recognize learning through multiple pathways while maintaining consistent standards. Don advocates for adopting these models despite barriers like terminology confusion and educators&#x27; preference for current systems, as they represent significant advances in learner-centered, performance-based education.<div class="expanded-tags"><span class="badge badge-low">PROFESSIONAL</span></div><div class="expanded-file"><a href="read/worth-a-look.html">Read</a> · <a href="files/Worth%20A%20Look.doc">Download</a></div></div></td>

Don reiterates that while many education improvement suggestions focus on early childhood, teacher training, and engagement, standards revision is often overlooked. Key issues include: establishing levels based on subject examination rather than learner age, distinguishing between administrative grade levels and achievement levels, separating teaching from student ranking/sorting, establishing clear benchmarks, and developing published rating scales. He proposes characteristics for assessment: independent from teachers, certifying proficiency, open to all ages/backgrounds, non-competitive, confidential.

He proposes performance-based systems incorporating student numbers served, specialty complexity, responsibility, innovation, and market factors. Teachers should earn merit rewards for strong performance while facing market consequences for weak performance. However, Don notes teachers&#x27; limited autonomy—scripted curricula, prescribed timing, limited creativity—undermines professional status necessary for higher pay.

While acknowledging high-technology economy needs educated workers, Don questions whether additional academic courses provide claimed breadth. He cites Senate report supporting core competencies: reading, writing, math, computer science, societal knowledge, learning-to-learn, teamwork, adaptability, information synthesis.

He provides a practical exercise: sketch steps from course entry to exit, sequence them, identify optional paths, and ask how you know the sequence is correct.

He connects DACUM (occupational analysis) to broader &quot;life roles&quot; (learner, producer, citizen, family member, consumer), proposing a outcomes hierarchy: life roles, occupation, general competencies, specific competencies, elaborations.

Key features include basing programs and assessments on demonstrated performance rather than time served, providing individualized tutoring as needed, and diagnosing learner progress through discussion and learning plans.

Don Glendenning defines systemic education issues and proposes functional solutions. He reiterates that education—preparation for life roles—differs fundamentally from schooling and requires comprehensive service delivery (policy, governance, instruction, resources, information, counseling, quality assurance). Key issues include: inadequate public statements of educational purpose and principles; limited Department mandate focused narrowly on curriculum delivery rather than broad educational leadership; absence of comprehensive vision statements; underserved information functions; conflicting quality assurance approaches; and disconnection from communities served. Don advocates for independent certification bodies (as in apprenticeships) to separate teaching from grading, allowing teachers to focus on learning without compromising their role. He emphasizes that community engagement and clear functional organization are essential for system improvement. The document calls for collaborative conversations between educators and communities to develop shared understanding.<div class="expanded-tags"><span class="badge badge-low">EDUCATION</span></div><div class="expanded-file"><a href="read/issues-2-education.html">Read</a> · <a href="files/Issues-2%20Education.doc">Download</a></div></div></td>

This document outlines teaching competencies and instructional steps necessary for educator development. Don identifies nine instructional competency areas: developing personal and professional competencies, instructional techniques, learning materials, learning environments, assisting self-directed and occupational learning, evaluating learner progress, administrative functions, and community interaction. The document compares Alberta&#x27;s teaching competencies (communication, organization, classroom management, facilitation, assessment, collaboration, caring, flexibility) with broader instructional frameworks. The emphasis on community interaction and broad competency development suggests Don&#x27;s view that teaching extends beyond classroom delivery to include community engagement and systemic responsibility.<div class="expanded-tags"><span class="badge badge-low">EDUCATION</span></div><div class="expanded-file"><a href="read/instruction.html">Read</a> · <a href="files/Instruction.docx">Download</a></div></div></td>

This condensed summary presents eight key issues Don Glendenning identifies in the education system: (1) education and schooling used interchangeably; (2) absent taxonomy for educational concepts; (3) education functions/services unidentified; (4) system relies on schools rather than comprehensive education system; (5) insufficient school autonomy despite OECD evidence supporting it; (6) unclear accountabilities; (7) limited services for independent learners; (8) assessment dependent on written tests; inadequate achievement reporting; system lacks benchmarks. This brief outline captures Don&#x27;s core concerns in structured format, suggesting preparation for policy discussions or public communication. The emphasis on missing frameworks, inadequate reporting, and system-wide communication gaps aligns with his central argument that educational clarity and purpose are foundational.<div class="expanded-tags"><span class="badge badge-low">EDUCATION</span></div><div class="expanded-file"><a href="read/issues-8-education.html">Read</a> · <a href="files/Issues-8%20Education.doc">Download</a></div></div></td>

Don Glendenning outlines potential mathematics education projects designed to align curriculum with practical application and competency-based assessment. Projects include: correlating PISA test content with actual community mathematics use; analyzing course content relevance to community application; developing performance-based rating scales; identifying competencies across grade levels; providing competency lists to students; adopting New Brunswick&#x27;s Grade 5 citizenship mathematics standards; questioning ranking systems; implementing self-rating practices; developing learning platforms; and establishing comprehensive learning competency frameworks. These projects reflect Don&#x27;s commitment to making mathematics education relevant, practical, and competency-focused rather than grade-focused.
