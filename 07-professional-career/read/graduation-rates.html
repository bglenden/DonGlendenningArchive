  GRADUATION RATES
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Glendenning critiques schools&#x27; time-based structure and advocates making graduation the objective while time becomes the variable. He notes schools measure achievement by how much students learn in fixed time, like measuring how far runners go in set time rather than how long they take to complete a course. Since learning rates vary individually and most students can master content with adequate time, extending the school year for struggling students would increase graduation rates. The proposal is modest—extra weeks for non-proficient students—but reflects his fundamental belief that time shouldn&#x27;t constrain capability. The document demonstrates Don&#x27;s capacity to identify simple, high-leverage systemic changes.</div>

<p><b>INCREASING GRADUATION RATES</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Schools are time based institutions.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The system sets the number of days schools are open, the number of hours of instruction each day, days to be made up because of storms, the length of time available on a subject before you must move to another, they keep attendance, time missed may result in the lowering of a grade, teacher pay scales are related to years of training and years of experience.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I can think of no other sector that is so driven by time.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The curriculum carves up subjects to be learned into subjects, units and lessons. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Rate of learning, on the other hand, is unique to each individual.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is generally understood that most students can learn most subjects to the same level if given time. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Learners enter school and are told, here is what is to be learned and here are the dates and times that teachers are available to help you learn.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And as you know, you are measured on ho much you learn in the time available.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>It is a bit like conducting a race and, instead of measuring the time it takes each to run the course, it measures how far you can run in a set time.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>ration the amount of teacher time available to students.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We organize schools around content to be learned and time available for instruction</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>We encourage students to stay in school and to graduate, and we should continue to do so.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Many more could graduate if they had a bit more time and help.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If this is so, why not give students the few extra days needed?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I am not suggesting that the school year be extended for all.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Students meeting graduation requirement should not have to stay longer; students not meeting graduation requirements should be allowed and encouraged to stay.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Let’s make graduation the objective and time the variable.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>One might be surprised on the impact of an extra couple of weeks of study on school graduation requirements.</p>
