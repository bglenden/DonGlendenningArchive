  500 CRSP
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Don describes his most ambitious consulting project: designing the Canadian Restructured School Plan to provide an alternative to lock-step, teacher-centered classroom systems. The model emphasizes personalization, competency-based content drawn from real life, computer-assisted delivery, flexible structure, and site-based management. CRSP tracks students from entry through exit based on competency mastery rather than time served. The methodology included a national steering committee, literature review, focus groups, visits to innovative schools across Canada, and consultation with 40 educational leaders. The model identifies major shifts from time-bound to flexible curricula, graded to continuous progress, and teacher-centered to learner-centered instruction.</div>

<p><b>DACUM</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b><i></i></b><br></p>
<p>	DACUM has come a long way since the first analysis was undertaken in Ottawa in January of 1968.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>For people not familiar with the term, DACUM is an acronym for <span><b>D</b></span><b>esign </b><span><b>A</b></span><b> </b><span><b>C</b></span><b>urricul</b><span><b>um</b></span><b> </b>and is a widely accepted approach to identifying competencies being practiced or to be learned – and it is no longer limited to an analysis of traditional occupations. And it is a Canadian idea at that.</p>
<p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>DACUM is most widely used<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>as a rigorous, relevant, inexpensive and internally consistent approach<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>to identifying competencies in a field or occupation.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A major strength is the reliance on practitioners as the major source of information and a presentation of the competencies of a field on a single sheet..<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As a result, DACUM escapes the semantics of the academic.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is life based rather than research based and, therefore, is readily understood by people in the field since it reflects what they do and is stated in a language that the field understands.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The performance-based rating scale proposed by Adams is unique.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It includes all the required elements of a good rating scale ─ competencies, performance criteria, a scale, and benchmarks.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>While it does not have rubrics or exemplars, they can easily be prepared.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>On the other hand, it has benchmarks (industry-based ones) which are missing in most other assessment systems I’ve seen.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In my reading and discussion, I have not found an assessment system as complete.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>A DACUM analysis is a tremendous tool for identifying and planning learning resources.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>For each competency, one can identify the kind of human resource expertise required; facilities, equipment and supplies; appropriate learning activities; assessment techniques and strategies; and the best location for learning whether it be a classroom, laboratory, shop or actually in a real work situation. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The model provides recognition for prior learning, self assessment, instructor confirmatiob of achievements,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>a tool for career planning, a basis for learning plans, a place for recording learner progress and achievement, a foundation for certification and a planning tool for lifelong learning and an exit document.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Another component is that of program delivery and management.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The DACUM model also includes a simple yet comprehensive learning model and an equally straight forward model for the management of learning by teachers.<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>And it ensures that learners and teachers are “singing from the same hymnbook.”</p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>Even wider adoption of the DACUM model suffers from:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>the inclusion of “curriculum” as part of the acronym.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>DACUM is not a curriculum but is useful tool for planning a curriculum.</p>
<p>DACUM developed out of an adult educational upgrading program and was first widely applied to trade and technical programs.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This is not a source where traditional educators look for innovation.</p>
<p>The DACUM-based learning model redistributes much of the control of the process from the teacher to the learner.</p>
<p>The rating scale and process is much more demanding than that presently used in the school system. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Would replace the current emphasis in schools on what we know to one of what we can do with what we know.</p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>It is 40 years since the first DACUM analysis was undertaken.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Much has changed since then especially in the field of information technology; many of these changes make a DACUM-like model even more appropriate.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Its introduction into the school system would give schools the capability of increasing flexibility, relevance, learner managed learning, …<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is a shame not to tap into DACUM’s rich potential.</p>

<p><b>CRSP</b></p>
<p>The CRSP model is:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>· Personalized in that it responds to and supports individual learners as they become increasingly self-motivated and independent learners. The model is built around non-gradedness, continuous progress and individualized instruction and tracks each student from the point at which they enter the program to the point at which they exit with a credit.</p>
<p>· competency based in that it draws content from real life rather that cut across traditional subject lines of academic disciplines. Competencies written as applications of knowledge, skills and attitudes judged necessary to function in adult life.</p>
<p>· computer based in that it makes use of technology to deliver and manage instruction. The use of technology also allows the learner and advisors to manipulate large numbers and quantities of resource materials with a focus on that which is most valuable to an individual learner.</p>
<p>· a flexible structure is needed to support large numbers of individual learners.</p>
<p>Characteristics of the model include a flexible school day and flexible school year, the multiple entry and exit of students, variable instructional and learning time to accommodate the view that more students can succeed if additional time is allowed.</p>
<p>· Based on site-based management allows planning and decision-making to occur at the school level so that day to day administration can be collegial and collaborative.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>While the writer recognizes his biases, CRSP is thought to be the only model which includes all components of a competency based system.</p>

<p>Although I retired from the college system in 1987, I was active as a consultant for a number of years thereafter. One of the most interesting assignments was a contract to design a competency based model for implementation at the secondary school level. It was both a stimulating and challenging assignment. The result was The Canadian Restructured School Plan, CRSP, which was designed to provide "an alternative to the existing lock-step, teacher centered, classroom based delivery system."</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The methodology included the establishment of National Project Steering Committee, an extensive literature review, convening of three focus groups, visits to innovative schools throughout Canada, a survey of 40 recognized Canadian educational leaders and considerable discussion within the committee and between committee members and professional colleagues.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The report identified a number of major shifts occurring in education including a shift:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>· From a system whereby students are admitted to school on an annuls or semiannual basis, to a more open system in which there is flexible entry and exit;</p>
<p>· From a rigid time-bound credit structure to flexible competency-based curriculum in which time is not held constant;</p>
<p>· From the lock-step graded structure to a non-graded continuous progress, individualized approach;</p>
<p>· From an instructional mode that is teacher -centered to one that is learner centered and teacher directed/assisted/managed;</p>
<p>· To an evaluation system which reports student progress in percentages or letter grades, to one which reports on the competencies mastered and the level of mastery reached;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p><b>NZQA</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>The development of a national qualifications framework in New Zealand arose from the fact that:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>· Some areas of learning had no nationally recognized qualifications;</p>
<p>· There was no obvious linkage between many of the qualifications and others · People were unclear where to find training to meet desired qualifications;</p>
<p>· Existing qualifications frequently did not recognize knowledge and skills already gained;</p>
<p>· Titles anctJDi1innology of certificates and diplomas have not been used consistently; and · Natinally rciognized certificates should help New Zealanders if they wish to work overseas.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The key principles of the National Qualifications Framework are:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>· It is desigsned to be easily understood and greatly simplifiesssssssssssssssssssssssss the range of career-related and academic qualifications that existed previously;</p>
<p>· It is designed to open pathways to earning. As learners progress they carry with them their previous learning which may be credited to a range of qualifications.</p>
<p>· It promotes lifelong learning. The primary focus is to meet the requirements of the learner. In doing so, no disticnction is drawn between general education and career-srelated learning.</p>
<p>· Assessment focuses on learner performance which is judged against published national standards. The use of clear standards in assessment allows flexibility in learning. As well as gaining recognition for formal learning, learners can be assessed on the job or through the recognition of pprior learning,;proces~</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The Framework t&amp;Cks~er Mrm J; the first six years of education, although it i;</p>
<p>possible for children to earn credits at a younger age.~the Ilrameworl&lt;: has eight levels.</p>
<p>A National Certificate will be used to recognize achievement at the first four levels. A nNational Diploma will recognize levels 5 to 7. Initial degrees will be placed at Level 7.</p>
<p>Level 8 is reserved for advanced degrees, diplomas and certificates.</p>

<p>The building blocks of the framework are Units of Learning. A Unit of Learning isw a set oflearning outcomes which a learner must master. A number of units may lead to a nationally recognized qualification. The same unit may apply to more than one q ualification. All units are not of the same length; some may be completed in a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
