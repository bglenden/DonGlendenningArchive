<div class="reader-summary">Extensive analysis of terminology confusion, purpose necessity, structural function-alignment, autonomy advantages (OECD PISA 13-country study findings), accountability systems (compliance, professional norms, results), standards application tensions (teaching vs. grading role conflicts), benchmarks (Grade 12 democratic society competency example), and collaborative engagement requirements. Proposes establishing independent qualification bodies separate from teacher assessment roles. Emphasizes education system modernization necessity. (Dated May 23, 2023)</div>

<p><b><i>ISSUES IN EDUCATION-3</i></b></p>
<p><b>About 4-11</b></p>
<p><b>May 23, 2023</b></p>
<p><b>It is widely recognized that education is a key factor in determining each citizen’s quality of life; in the same way, the collective education of our citizens will determine to a significant degree the quality of the communities in which we live. Government support is justified for two reasons, one to support personal growth and development for every citizen; the other is to ensure the common good. Educating is a complex matter made so by the fact that each person is unique in many ways, unique in basic physical, mental, emotional make-up; unique in the range and nature of previous experience, unique in perceived futures, but also unique in terms of learning pace, style and needs.Given the numbers served and the wide range of prior experience, capabilities and interests of learners, designing and operating an education system is no easy task. These complexities have given rise to the following structural issues:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Terminology – Educators are creative people; they try to accommodate a number of concepts with a single term. Learning excellence as an example. On the other hand, the writer seldom finds definitions in educational writings nd certainly<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>is left with the impression that going to school, in all its configurations, naturally leads to a good education. Confusing education and schooling</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Purpose – Purpose provides the fundamental reason for establishing an organization, a reason for which some-thing is done or created; it is also the key element in the structuring process and one from which all others follow. To be meaningful, a purpose statement must be easy to understand, explain why the work is important, contribute to the alignment of activities, and be manageable.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b>Structure – Educ is a service. Typically, the structure of organizations is based on the dictum “form follows function”. The Department seems to have ignored this rule.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As a result, some services have been left out. “form follows function” is the usual basis for structuring an organization; that’s why purpose is so important. Preparing for employment, furthering ones academic studies, knowledge and skills of citizenship are frequent purposes. Departments of education need leadership in th evarious functions<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>function a citizens or just to be self-sufficient in their future years. The struc-ture of the Australian De-partment of Education re-flects a number of live roles – childhood development, cit-izenship studies, employ-ment preparation<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>the educa-tion task.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Context</b></p>
<p><b>Education has entered a new area; our “education system” needs to be updated.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>fact, I<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>would argue that we no longer have an edu-caton sytem but a number of school systems instead.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Let’s en-gage Islanders in the change pro-cess. If you do this, and it is open to the public, count me in.</b></p>
<p><b>Autonomy – the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development did a study of PISA results from 13 countries and found that<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>students from schools with autonomy in<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>their day to day operation had better PISA results.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b>Accountability – According to Anderson (See below) there are three main types of accountability – compliance, adherence to professional norms and results. Organizational accountability is about defining an organization’s mission, values and goals as well as everyone’s role in working towards them; holding yourself, and everyone else,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>responsible for accomplishing goals, completing assignments and making decisions that deliver on expectations;<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>people resist and fail to support what they don’t understand; culture of accountability. Start with clarity and set expectations; be goal focused, hire the right people, Communicate with transparency. team and individual productivity, builds trust and collaboration, helps organization perform . Martin Bedard, Montreal Economic Institute, tells us that when teachers and principals have greater autonomy and accountability, students generally achieve better grades, even when standards living are considered.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Autonomy, it seems, results in higher levels of satisfaction among teachers, better serves students with different learning styles, the article also points out that the high level of pedagogical autonomy in Quebec increased autonomy and accountability is sometimes credited with higher levels of contributes to their success in national and international tests.</b></p>
<p><b>Standards<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Diagnosis, Grades and grading , assessment ???- There is tension in the application of school standards. Some see conflict<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>when those who teach also grade. Emerging preference for simply reporting achievement level on each competency demonstratedEstablish a qualification body for the purpose certifying individual levels of achievement to persons wanting or needing such documentation.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The role of teachers is to help others learn; when teachers rank their students, they are 	putting their ability to teach at risk. Assigning student grades, selecting 	students for prizes and awards and awarding diplomas and degrees is a sorting 	process and should not be part of a teacher’s role.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Apprenticeship with 	certification through a Provincial</b></p>
<p><b>Access – limited to schools</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Benchmarks – benchmarks are levels of performance widely recognized by practitionners and the public at large as a reference point against which others are measured.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>An education benchmark for Grade 12 might be “to demonstrates the skills, knowlde and attitudes necessary to thrive in a democratic society”. A recent paper from New Brunswick proposed that “ every child will leave grade five<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>having mastered the tools to learn – reading, writing and numeracy</b></p>
