  08 Critical issues
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Don recounts a contracted report on critical secondary education issues, prepared with a former university president, school superintendent, and deputy minister. The report identified six critical issues and proposed fourteen demonstration projects addressing application of information technology, teacher preparation, accountability, school leadership, poorly served students, and linkage/coordination. Proposed pilots included alternative school models, competency-based programs, student part-time employment guidelines, and an open system allowing exam challenges without coursework. Don notes many suggestions remain valid for demonstration projects and references the Canadian Restructured School Project (CRSP) arising from this work.</div>

<p><b>Critical Issues in Secondary<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b>Education in Canada</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>A decade ago I was contracted to prepare a paper on critical issues in secondary education in Canada.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This became the forerunner of a major project led by the Canadian Vocational Association known as the Canadian Restructured School Plan. As part of the process, I brought together a former university president, a former superintendent of schools and a former deputy minister of education.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The result was a brief paper, some 10 to 12 pages; the paper was prepared under contract and was not published.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The ideas which follow are drawn directly from that report.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>The ideas included in the paper were based on the following assumptions</b>:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>That Canada’s future economic prosperity and standard of living will be determined in a large degree by the degree to which its educational system develops the nation’s human resources, thus enabling it to compete successfully in the global economy.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>That rapid technological change will continue to impact on the world of work and our secondary schools for the foreseeable future.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>That secondary education should operate to serve the needs of all youth in the age bracket normally accommodated in Grades 10 through 12.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>The paper then went on to identify the following issues:</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>Application of information technology in secondary schools</p>
<p>The preparation of teachers</p>
<p>Accountability</p>
<p>Leadership at the school level</p>
<p>Poorly served students</p>
<p>Linkage and coordination</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>The authors suggested that strategies and interventions should meet the following criteria:</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>Evidence, based on experience and research, that the project is likely to be successful in addressing the issues</p>
<p>Interventions should be possible within the financial limits of the agencies involved and should seek to maximize existing resources</p>
<p>Strategies should be seen as credible by educators, school boards and government</p>
<p>Reasonable assurance that the intervention, if successful, could easily be applied ore broadly across the system</p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Fourteen possible demonstrations/experiments were identified but not prioritized and are listed below:</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>Identity a school or schools in which to locate a terminal or terminals to enable students and teachers to access remote databases.</p>
<p>Develop a comprehensive transcript/passport/record of achievement/portfolio which would describe a student in terms of cognitive, psychomotor and affective domains…</p>
<p>Develop a study related to improvement of communication skills including interpersonal competencies by using an experimental school and a control school.</p>
<p>Gather information on successful innovations related to the issues (raised earlier in the paper)</p>
<p>Invite (national associations) to<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>cooperate in developing and running on a pilot basis, a program to prepare school administrators.</p>
<p>Invite (national organizations) to jointly present proposals for alternative approaches to organizing secondary schools</p>
<p>Support an alternative school which leads to a regular high school graduation diploma, e.g. competency based, schools without walls, etc.</p>
<p>Investigate the matter of student part-time employment and suggest policy guidelines which school boards across the country might adopt or adapt.</p>
<p>Identify criteria which distinguish a high school graduate from a person who does not graduate,</p>
<p>Develop an open system which will allow any person to challenge for a subject of for a high school<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>certificate.</p>
<p>Fund a private sector storefront guidance and counseling service with counselors able to issue vouchers for courses offered by a public or private school, college and university.</p>
<p>Develop a program planning model which starts with objectives and ends with evaluation criteria.</p>
<p>Establish a private autonomous agency to coordinate the education and training of 15 year old students who have left the education environment without a certificate.</p>
<p>Undertake a follow up comparative study of teachers who have entered the profession after having received their training as “mature” students vs. those who moved directly from secondary school through university to a teaching career.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>In my view, many of the suggestions are still valid and worth exploring as demonstration projects.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The Canadian Restructured School Project (CRSP) conducted by the Canadian Vocational Association arose out of this report.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Readers who are interested in school reform or CRSP should contact the Canadian Vocational Association.</p>
