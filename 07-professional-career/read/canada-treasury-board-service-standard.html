  Canada Treasury Board Service Standard
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Canada Treasury Board guidance document defining service standards and their importance in government operations. Defines service standard as public commitment to measurable performance levels clients can expect under normal circumstances. Addresses what constitutes normal vs. special circumstances (holidays, emergencies, natural disasters). Explains importance of service standards for client service, performance management, expectation clarity, service improvement, results-based management, and government accountability. Describes two key purposes of service standards though full text is truncated. Relevant to institutional management and accountability frameworks.</div>

<p><b>Canada Treasury Board Service Standard</b></p>
<p><b>What Is a Service Standard</b></p>
<p>A service standard is a public commitment to a measurable level of performance that clients can expect under normal circumstances.</p>
<p><b>What are "Normal Circumstances</b>"?</p>
<p>When developing service standards, the organization should consider its resources and expected level of demand for regular day-to-day service operations (normal circumstances). Special circumstances where regular service standards may not apply include holidays, the end of April for tax filing, natural disasters, or emergencies. These are circumstances that are typically not within the organization's control.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Why Are Service Standards Important?</b></p>
<p>Service standards are integral to good client service and to effectively managing performance. They help clarify expectations for clients and employees, drive service improvement, and contribute to results-based management. Service standards reinforce government accountability by making performance transparent, and increase the confidence of Canadians in government by demonstrating the government's commitment to service excellence.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Service standards serve two key purposes:</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>To provide staff with performance targets ("Phone must be answered within three rings"); and</p>
<p>To inform clients what to expect ("Waiting time is less than 10 minutes").</p>
<p>Many organizations have implemented service standards that serve these purposes. Examples are included in Appendix A.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>A service standard should be linked to an operational performance target or the frequency to which the organization expects to meet the service standard. The target takes into account the risks associated with process delays and uncertainties arising from factors such as workload fluctuations, staff movements, and seasonal variations.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The purpose of the target is to help manage operations and track progress against overall delivery objectives. The target is typically designed for management use but can also be made available to the public. Table 1 below provides examples that distinguish between a service standard and an operational performance target.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Keep in Mind</b></p>
<p>Operational performance targets are a good starting point. Working from a target to a meaningful external service standard can save design time and effort.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Table 1. Comparing Service Standards and Operational Standards</p>
<p>Service Standard	Operational Performance Target</p>
<p>The Canada Revenue Agency has put in place a standard to process T2 corporation income tax returns within 60 days.	The target for achieving this standard is set at 90 per cent.</p>
<p>Western Economic Diversification Canada has established a standard that states: "WD will issue a claim payment cheque within 15 business days of receiving a complete claim from the client, including all of the required claim information."	The target for meeting this standard is set at 95 per cent.</p>
<p>What Is a Service Pledge?</p>
<p>Service standards are distinct from service pledges. Specifically, a service pledge is a public commitment to a basic code of conduct and generally consists of a qualitative statement expressed within values and principles. A pledge can provide the overarching service direction for an organization and provide context to the service standard development process. A comparison of service pledges and service standards can be found in Appendix B.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The following are examples of service pledges from the Economic Development Agency of Canada for the Regions of Quebec: "We undertake to provide our clientele with quality service." "We serve our clients courteously and professionally." "We serve our clients in the official language of their choice." (Website of the Economic Development Agency of Canada for the Regions of Quebec. Accessed on October 25, 2011).</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Characteristics of a Good Service Standard</b></p>
<p><b>Relevant to the client</b>: Service standards are consistent with client priorities and address aspects of the service they value most within available resource allocations.</p>
<p><b>Based on consultation</b>: Service standards are developed in consultation with clients, managers, staff, and other partners in service delivery to ensure that they are meaningful and match the organization's mandate.</p>
<p><b>Measurable:</b> Service standards are quantifiable and linked to monitoring activities.</p>
<p><b>Consistent across government</b>: Service standards should be consistent throughout federal organizations providing similar services. Having similar service standards across government for similar services helps both clients and government. Clients will find it easier to deal with different organizations, and the organizations themselves will find it easier to share best practices and adopt common approaches.</p>
<p><b>Ambitious but realistic</b>: Service standards are realistic, based on analysis and consistent with objectives, yet sufficiently challenging to service providers.</p>
<p><b>Endorsed by management</b>: Service standards are understood and endorsed by senior management.</p>
<p><b>Communicated:</b> Service standards are clearly communicated to clients, employees, and other stakeholders to help manage expectations.</p>
<p><b>Transparent:</b> Service standards are monitored and reported to senior management, and performance results are published to ensure transparency and client trust.</p>
<p><b>Continuously updated</b>: Service standards are regularly reviewed and updated as appropriate.</p>
