  17 Arts Workshop
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Don&#x27;s planning notes for an Arts Workshop initiative in fall 2008. Drawing on a $3,000 outstanding payment from Royal Bank (redirected from IAHSP), Don proposed using these funds as seed money to expand arts organization capacity building. Discusses partnerships with DOCH and the Province, addressing topics like linking arts and business, governance, and financial management. Mentions proposed &quot;Leave An Artistic Legacy&quot; pamphlet for distribution to allied professionals (doctors, lawyers, accountants) to encourage charitable giving. Shows Don&#x27;s creative approach to nonprofit sustainability and his understanding of cross-sector partnership potential.</div>

<p><b>17</b></p>
<p><b>Arts workshop</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>When IAHSP ended, there was an outstanding payment from the Royal Bank of $3,000 on its commitment.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Because the Bank does not contribute to endowments, I suggested that, instead, we accept the contribution<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>and use it for purposes similar to that for which it was originally intended.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Royal Bank accepted the proposal. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Since then, I have had discussions with DOCH and the Province about an Arts Workshop in the fall of 2008<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My plan is to use the $3,000 as seed money and lever some additional funds including some overhead for CFPEI.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I am in touch with participants about a follow-up activity..</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Ideas put forward included:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Adding Value; continuing; extending; consolidating</p>
<p>Linking arts and business; fundraising, marketing studies, donor base development, volunteer management, strategic planning, governance, expertise<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>development in specific areas such as touring and financial management</p>
<p>Supporting long term sustainability;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>capacity building covers governance, management practices, financial sufficiency, development of new and diversified audiences</p>
<p>Components:	Development, capacity building, networking, governance, management practices,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Arts/industry partnership, matching of need and expertise/ loan/assignment of business people to arts organizations</p>
<p>Feasibility study of<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>a Professional Partners Program for the Arts – short term placements of professionals from business to arts organizations.</p>
<p>IAHSP:<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>very much a work in progress; goal setting and monitoring, quarterly financial review, training for ED; Information exchange among organizations;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Also hahd some discussions with Arsenault, MacDearmid, Langille about the federal matching grant for endowment building but decided not to pursue it further.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Now focused on a workshop in late 2008 for participants in the IAHSP program.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Sent enquiry to see if there is any intertest;<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>five emails sent, only Scott macauley responded</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>One thing I suggested at a previous workshop was for IAHSP Program organizations to come together in producing a pamphlet that would be circulated in the waiting areas and offices of Allied Professionals(doctors, lawyers, accountants, financial planners).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The pamphlet might be called…Leave An Artistic Legacy...and each organization would have their own dedicated panel describing their mission, reason for being, registered charitable number(if any) board members, web site, etc.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p>This document would plant the seed in readers to consider leaving a legacy in their wills, through life insurance policies, stocks or properties etc. during their lives or in their estates.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Community Foundation could be the catalyst bringing all of these independent groups under one umbrella or assist in marketing the organizations as separate<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Independent entities.</p>
