  Vocational HS
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">(179 words):** Don addresses vocational secondary education&#x27;s decline, identifying both obvious factors (facility costs, image, program obsolescence) and deeper issues: academic-general education conflation inflating academic credit requirements. However, he notes research reveals no course-configuration superiority for further education or employment. While acknowledging high-technology economy needs educated workers, Don questions whether additional academic courses provide claimed breadth. He cites Senate report supporting core competencies: reading, writing, math, computer science, societal knowledge, learning-to-learn, teamwork, adaptability, information synthesis. Critically, Don argues these skills aren&#x27;t content-driven but approach-dependent. Vocational welding courses often better develop core competencies than traditional history classrooms: real projects, responsibility assumption, authentic work habits, freedom of movement—practices schools often discourage. Don proposes secondary programs group subjects under clusters (science, social studies, communications, business, technology), allowing individual courses to serve general or vocational purposes depending on instructor approach and learner intent. He advocates eliminating academic-vocational distinctions, allowing student choice to guide educational decisions.</div>

<p><b>42 Secondary Education:</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Is there a place for Vocational Courses?</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>vocational education in secondary schools is at a crossroads.</p>
<p>Some of the reasons are obvious: cost of facilities, lower student teacher ratio, image, programs becoming out of date, failure to develop programs in emerging occupations, delay by students in making career choices, and the list goes on.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>But there is a more major reason for the decline and that is the view that general education and academic education are one and the same. The result of this view, widely held by those who make speeches and make or influence decisions, is an increase in the number of academic credits required for High School graduation. Understandable and commendable, but is it based on fact? Our reading railed to reveal one pattern of courses at the secondary school level to be better than another as preparation for further education or for life (Perhaps our readers can enlighten us).</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The argument goes something like this. We are moving into an era of high technology, information as a resource, rapid change, and the global economy. A better educated work force is a key component. Better educated means more years of schooling - a minimum of high school graduation and preferable some postsecondary education.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Education must also be more transferable so that one can adjust to changing times. Vocational courses are too narrow and limiting. Additional academic courses are the answer so that the worker will have a broader base and have more options open to him/her.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>In support of the need for more transferable or generic education, one reads on page 3 of the recent Senate report entitled, In Training, Only Work Works:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>"To transform information into knowledge in our information society, our people need basic, core skills: the ability to read, write and understand complex material; to comunicate in one's mother tongue; to know a certain level of mathematics and computer science; to know how society and the world work; and to learn how to learn. As well, we should give people the skills needed to: work with a team;</p>
<p>adapt to change; assimilate information; transform it into knowledge; apply it appropriately in order to find, hold or create a job; and, where appropriate, lead and innovate."<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>If educators agree with this, then it should be reflected in what they do. Secondary school programs should be designed to ensure that graduates exhibit these characteristics. There are two variables to be considered. One is the content the other is the approach.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Logically, the next question is "What secondary school courses (content) best develop the desired characteristics?" Communication (English or French), Canadian History, Physics, Secretarial Studies, Welding or ????? It is obvious that one must teach content but it should be obvious also that the general skills outlined above are not primarily content driven.</p>
<p>That being so, one looks at another variable.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The approach to instruction varies from school to school and from course to course within a school.l Traditionally, a study of history takes place in a classroom setting where students listen to the teacher, read the text, answer oral questions, complete short answer tests, and write occasional essays or take essay exams. Contrast this with a welding course where students spend a block of two or three hours at a time. They have considerable freedom to move around within the shop, to plan real work, work on real projects, write reports on topics of interest, take responsibility for tools and equipment, and develop work habits that are consistent with the work world. The list goes on.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>To develop a full thesis as to the importance of vocational courses at the secondary school level would take more space than this article allows. However, as a result of a recent review of the literature, discussion with educators and feedback from students and employers, the writers have concluded that:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>o All secondary school students should be encouraged to elect vocational courses</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>o The terms academic and vocational at the secondary school level have outlived their usefulness</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>o The education of the majority of secondary school students suffers because of the controls exerted by colleges and universities (vocational courses suffer most because of this)</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>o The criteria on which levels of courses are assessed are not well defined</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>o Vocational education is a focus on at a level</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>o There is a need for an open and vigorous debate on the role</p>
<p><br></p>

<p>I~.r:: _._ ___L~~.__ ..L__ .__~ .1_1__</p>
<p><br></p>
<p></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>o Secondary school programs could benefit from having more people in administrative positions who have emerged from the ranks of vocational educators</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The media contains almost daily reference to the need for greater investment in education, especially the education of our youth.</p>
<p>While the facts are documented, wrong conclusions can easily be drawn. It is hoped that this article will evoke some discussion.</p>
