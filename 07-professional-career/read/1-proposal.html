</div>

<div class="reader-summary">The grant proposal for the DACUM project submitted to Community Foundation of Prince Edward Island. Documents the historical context: post-WWII industrial expansion relying on skilled European immigrants, 1960 Technical and Vocational Training Assistance Act funding, mid-1960s Canada NewStart Corporations demonstration projects, and Robert Adams&#x27; development of the DACUM (Developing a Curriculum) competency analysis model in Yarmouth, Nova Scotia. Notes Holland College&#x27;s 1970 adoption and adaptation of DACUM into the STEP model, and describes the proposed event: a commemorative gathering at Haviland Club in Charlottetown (1:00-4:00 pm) featuring DACUM panel discussion, remembrance of Robert Edwin Adams, book presentation to Holland College, and reception.</div>

A CANADIAN ACHIEVEMENT</b></p>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><b>Background:</b></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">The
decade of industrial expansion immediately after WW2 was only
possible because of the influx of skilled immigrants from Western
Europe.  By the late 1950’s it became evident that Canada could no
longer depend on this source of supply. Furthermore, large numbers of
Canadians remained unemployed even though Canada suffered from a
shortage of skilled workers.  The Technical and Vocational Training
Assistance Act (1960) provided massive funding to remedy the problem</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">In
the mid 1960’s, TVTA administrators joined with officials working
on the issue of high unemployment and slow economic growth  and
pooled their efforts in support of a series of demonstration
projects.  These projects, called Canada NewStart Corporations were
funded by the Federal Government but given a large degree of
independence as to their clientele and  focus of their research.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">One
of the NewStart Corporations was established in Yarmouth, Nova Scotia
with Tom Jones as Director and Robert Adams as Director of
Occupational Training.  Given Adams experience in occupational and
functional analyses, it was not surprising that analysis was a
cornerstone of  programming in his projects.  The foundation of Adams
work was a competency analysis of the occupation for which training
was being provided with competencies being drawn from skilled
practitioners under the leadership of a trained facilitator.  This
resulted in a single-sheet presentation of competencies which could
be used by a variety of users.  Adams went further and outlined a
training model based on the DACUM model.  The model was adopted and
adapted to become the STEP model of Holland College effective
September 1, 1970</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><b>Purpose:</b>
To recognize the DACUM analysis process as a Canadian achievement, to
promote the model  and to recognize Robert Edwin Adams, its
developer.</p>

the 1960’s Canada  and the Provinces mounted a massive technical
and vocational training program to prepare Canadians to participate
in the post war industrial expansion.  Cost were  shared by the
federal and provincial governments that was the envy of many
countries.

hiIBy
the mid 1960’s a new component was added, namely a series of pilo
tprojectsn the mid to deal with the issue of high unemployment and
slow economic growth,  A dozen demonstration or pilot  projects were
mounted across the country in slow-growth areas.  These projects,
called Canada NewStart Corporations were mounted in every Province,
were funded by the Federal Government but given a large degree of
local independence as to their clientele and  focus of their
research.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">T
Nova Scotia  NewStart Corporation in Yarmouth, Nova Scotia Adams
worked directly with local employers and unemployed youth to develop
relevnt training for people wnting yo improve their lot in life.  The
model became known as DACUM (Developing a Curriculum) with the first
step being an  inexpensive, relevant and  competency analysis.of
users.  Adams went further and outlined a training model based on the
competency analysis .  In 1970 DACUM mode was adapted and adopted by
Holland College, a new communityCollege established in PEI.  The
model was picked up across the country but its real impact is its
acceptance as the pproach of choice  around the world.</p>
