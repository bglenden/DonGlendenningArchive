  07 Components
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">A technical but accessible exposition of the four components comprising a true educational standard: competencies (observable, measurable, community-drawn actions people can perform); criteria (quality measures like consistency, speed, safety); levels of performance (distinguishing how well someone performs, not just whether they can); and benchmarks (community-based reference points anchoring performance levels to real-world contexts). Glendenning critiques the vagueness in existing educational standards and provides his own &quot;Glendenning version,&quot; arguing that effective standards must integrate all four components. He uses practical examples like editing or driving to illustrate how performance levels vary independently from basic competence.</div>

<p><b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>STANDARDS</b><b></b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Should note be two standards school and community or employment</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Everyone seems to have a favourite story about school standards.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Most seem to involve reading, writing, geography, Canadian History and work habits. It has ever been thus; criticisms go back at least to the time of the Greeks but that is not to say that the issue should be ignored. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Old timers seem to think that school standards have deteriorated.<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Based on some of my old exam papers that I came across recently, I think that my children were more advanced in their school studies than I was at that stage of schooling,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Maybe; I really don’t know.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The reason I am not sure is that, to my way of thinking, educational standards have never been well defined.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>For the purpose of this article::</p>
<p>The terms outcome and competency interchangeably</p>
<p>I distinguish between testing for the purpose awarding improving learning from testing for the purpose of granting recognition.</p>
<p>I have focused on the public school system although much of what I say applies to postsecondary education as well.</p>
<p>Since school systems profess to be outcome based, this article will focus on outcomes or competency based education.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Although I have browsed many a bulletin from Departments of Education, I have not found a satisfactory description of what constitutes a standard – at least not one satisfactory to me. So, hers is the Glendenning version.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>By educational standard I refer to the level of performance required of a student in order to receive recognition. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>An educational standard includes four components:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Competencies<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>We demonstrate what we have learned by what we can do.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Statements of what we are able to do are known as competencies.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Competencies:</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Describe an observable action</p>
<p>Drawn from the community being served<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Are attainable</p>
<p>Are measurable</p>
<p>Be stated in clear<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>2	Criteria</b><b></b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Criteria are the unadorned measures used to assess a person’s performance on a competency and should not be confused with components of a skill or sub-skills.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>For example the ability to read and write are a sub-skills of communications and are not themselves performance criteria.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Common criteria for assessing performance include:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Quality of the product or service</p>
<p>How quickly one performs,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Ability to perform under unusual conditions</p>
<p>Coping with unanticipated problems</p>
<p>Degree of supervision requiewd</p>
<p>Consistency</p>
<p>Minimizing risk/safety of self and others</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>3	Levels of performance</b><b></b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>Defining differences is not easy. Bloom’s taxonomy of learning shows six levels of learning in the cognitive domain, five in the affective domain and seven in the psychomotor domain.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Since people may be looking for a middle level or “C” thosoe forcing raters, either ones’ self or others, away from an easy C.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Presumably one who cannot perform at all would rate a zero.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>On the other hand, at the top level of performance one would be expected to be able to perform at an acceptale level even under extenuating circumstances.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Onne might think that the ability to teach a skill would represent the highest level of performance; on the other hand, I would argue that teaching is a separate skill. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>4	Benchmark</b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>A benchmark is a point of reference which anchors a rating scale to the community being served.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Reaching the benchmark level is not the aim of the course, it simply gives meaning to the discussion about one’s level.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A “C” could indicate that a new driver is ready to drive under normal driving conditions in moderate traffic during daylight hours, a “C” might describe a laboratory technician who is capable of performing with occasional supervision, a “c” for a teacher could mean a teacher with a good knowledge of the subject(s0 being taught and a reasonable array of standard teaching techniques.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Such as may be used by a teacher with a couple of year’s experience. The identification of a benchmark must be sufficiently clear that it is readily identified in both the mind of the teacher, the student and the public at large..</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Obviously, the subject requires a much more detailed examination;<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>the above constitutes only an entry point into the discussion.</p>
