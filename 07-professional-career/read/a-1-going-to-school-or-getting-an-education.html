  A 1 Going to School or Getting an Education
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">A foundational piece distinguishing between schooling and education, fundamental to Don&#x27;s educational philosophy. He contrasts schooling (formal institutional training) with education (broader development of abilities and positive behavior values in society). Don uses educational dictionary definitions and references George Bernard Shaw and Canadian business leaders to illustrate the confusion between these concepts. He argues that education encompasses learning from home, church, community, and experience—not just schools. The essay explores why credentialing systems emphasize degrees over actual capabilities, and proposes that education should be measured by one&#x27;s ability to apply knowledge, demonstrate citizenship, communicate effectively, solve problems, and maintain ethical responsibility rather than by institutions attended or credentials held.</div>

<p><b>Going to School or Getting an Education</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Recently my wife mentioned that a daughter of a friend had difficulty finding employment, especially well paid employment.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This puzzled my wife and she added that the young lady in question”had a good education”.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I asked “How do you know?”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My wife replied, “She has a master’s degree from…” and she named the university.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“That tells me about her school, I said, but how do you know that she as a good education?”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Need I say more?.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The above points to one of the critical issues in education – the confusion between schooling and education.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This thinking is prevalent both inside and outside the system.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We do not similarly confuse health and hospitalization, religion with church attendance or citizenship with court appearances.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Why, therefore, do we continue to speak of education when we mean schooling?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We have a school system but not an education system.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Educators, at least, should know the difference.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Is it just sloppy thinking or is it part of a deliberate plan to blur the lines? <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Good’s Dictionary of Education defines schooling as “individual training or education received in an educational institution, military or civilian.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Education, on the other hand, is defined as “the aggregate of all processes by means of which a person develops abilities, attitudes and other forms of behaviour of positive value in the society in which he lives.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Schooling is that part of one’s education resulting from ones experiences while in school.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>George Bernard Shaw is reputed to have said, “At a very early age, I had to interrupt my education to go to school”.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Bud MacDougall, a Canadian business icon now deceased, once said, “I left school at 14 and I’ve regretted it all my life.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Biggest mistake I ever made.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Should have left when I was 12.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It has also been said that we should bestow a bachelor’s degree on all newborns so that the process of education will not be disturbed in later life.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I am not knocking the value of schools; they are major contributors to one’s education.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But so are the home, church, peers, travel, the community and others.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The popular view is that we get our education in schools and from elsewhere we get only experience.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But isn’t the essence of education learning from experience wherever that experience occurs?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>One’s education is certainly lacking without the knowledge and understanding of history, language, science, mathematics and the arts.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Add to that the need for highly homed communication skills.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>These are certainly contributors to one’s education but they are not one’s education.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Some parents prefer to teach their children at home.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We call it home schooling.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Since home schooling usually follows the school curriculum, why not call it home education?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We also hear of people who are self-taught, self made, home schooled but seldom, if ever, self-educated, home educated.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Why not?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Is a person with two degrees better educated than a person with one degree?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Is as person with three degrees even better educated?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Where do honourary degrees fit into the scheme of things?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Is a person without a high school diploma or university degree uneducated? Unschooled? Or both?</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The school system draws its content from a narrow range of disciplines.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Typical school subjects include English, French, science, art, physics, chemistry, biology and mathematics.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Education, on the other hand, draws its content from real life and addresses the issue of what a person knows and what one can do with what one knows.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A measure of one’s education is the level and extent to which one can apply what one has learned – in fact, in my view, that is the highest level.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Perhaps the difference between education and schooling is best illustrated by the way they are described.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Our schooling is often described by the number of years of study, the institutions at which we studied or from which we graduated, the results of our examinations and the diplomas and degrees we hold. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>One’s level of education defies such precise description.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A description of one’s level of education would likely be described in terms of ones ability to:</p>
<p>Display good citizenship</p>
<p>Communicate with people at all levels</p>
<p>Demonstrate personal, civic, social and environmental responsibility</p>
<p>Apply technology</p>
<p>Solve problems</p>
<p>Demonstrate a positive work ethic, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Exercise respect and cooperation.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Blurring the differences between education and schooling may work to the advantage of educational institutions but does nothing for learners.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In fact, blurring the differences is more likely to:</p>
<p>Discourage life long learning</p>
<p>Create dependence rather than promote self reliance</p>
<p>Limit learning to what is available in school or organized by teachers</p>
<p>Limit the range of studies to traditional disciplines,</p>
<p>Deemphasize the importance of personal skills such as self-reliance, problem solving, entrepreneurship and creativity.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>A system is in plalce to provide schooling, and I think it is a good one.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But let’s call it what it is, a school system not an education system.Removing the confusion could make a major contribution to the reform to our educational system.</p>
