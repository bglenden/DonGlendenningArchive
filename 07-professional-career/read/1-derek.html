<p><br></p>
<p>I am pleased to provide a letter of reference for Derek McEwen who is applying for the position of Curriculum Director in the re-organized Department of Education.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I’ve gotten to know Derek over the last couple of years and, during this time, found him to be professional in all our dealings, knowledgeable about matters of education, willing to<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>share his knowledge and expertise, and able to stand his ground on issues where we differ. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Although not familiar with his earlier work, I understand that he has a good record as a teacher and principal in the public schools of PEI.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Lacking information about his previous education roles and a position description for the Director of Curriculum, I am reluctant to comment more directly on his suitability for the emerging role.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Suffice it to say that, based on our working relationship, I have no hesitation in providing this recommendation.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Don Glendenning, C.M.</p>
