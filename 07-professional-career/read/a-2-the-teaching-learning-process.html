  A 2 The Teaching Learning Process
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Drawing on his early teaching experience in a one-room rural school at age seventeen, Don reflects on the critical gap in his teacher training regarding the teaching-learning process. He emphasizes three components: learner, teacher, and process. Don rejects the &quot;empty vessel&quot; metaphor for learners, arguing instead that teachers create conditions for effective learning. He defines learning as behavioral change across cognitive, affective, and psychomotor domains. A key insight is that &quot;a teacher hasn&#x27;t taught if a learner hasn&#x27;t learned,&quot; applied to each individual learner. Don advocates for schools to develop and publish learning models showing the steps learners take from course entry to exit, with multiple pathways accounting for different starting points and paces. He provides practical guidance for drafting such models and argues this understanding would have made him a better teacher.</div>

<p><b>11-The Teaching Learning Process</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>At age 17, in preparation for a teaching career, I attended Teacher’s College in Fredericton, N.B.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Given the shortage of teachers after the War, the Province offered a six months training program twice a year<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>at the newly named Teachers’ College in Fredeiricton, New Brunswick.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>While still only seventeen, I commenced teaching in a one-room rural school.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was an experience I will never forget.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We survived; I learned; whether students learned is another matter.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>me.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I still recall, at least some of the information and instruction received in Teacher’s College about developing lesson plans, using audio visual aids, maintaining the school register, school law, psychology, teaching methods, etc. but I recall little if anything about the teaching-learning process.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Learning about learning, unfortunately for my students, came much later.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I am not even saying that it was niot included in the curriculum; what I am saying is that, if offered, it certainly did not register with</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I believe that a clear understanding of the teaching-lerning process is critical; there are three components – the learner, the teacher and the process.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Let’s start with the learner.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Some believe that a learner is an empty vessel waiting to be filled – from a big pitcher, the teacher, to a small pitcher, the learner.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Others view learners as tender plants needing protection and nurturing with a teacher as the gardener.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>While I like the latter image, in my view, it portrays the learner as much too passive.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Simply stated, a teacher is a person who helps another person to learn; a person whose role it is to create conditions for effective learning.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Learning is a process of change.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When a learner learns, learner has more or different knowledge, skills or attitudes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In educational jargon, changes may be in the cognitive, affective or psychomotor domains.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>More simply put, a person who has learned has new attitudes, skills or information or some combination thereof. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>To learn is to change.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Learning is an indivduao matter.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Only the learner can learn.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>To help a learner to learn is to help brinng about changes in the learner..<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The stimulus for learning may be internal or external and the actual learning may take place in a group setting or when the individual is alone.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A teacher does not teach a class; a teacher teaches a number of individuals at the same time in a group setting. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Readers have likely heard the statement “A teacher hasn’t taught if a learner hasn’t learned”.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Thaat stastement always brought vigorous discussion in my classes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I believe that to be true but it must be applied to each learner.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A learner has learned only if there is a change of behaviour. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The role of a teacher is to stimulate learning – to create a set of circumstances so that a learner learns the desired behaviour.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Teachers need a variety of techniques in their tool chest – and they will likely require all of them.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Tools include setting an example, providing information, asking questions, setting time lines, assigning projects or home work, organizing field trips and assessing performance.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The trick for each teacher is to create a learning environment for each learner that will end up with each learner having a favorable experience even in a group setting.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Not easy but it is the crux of good teaching.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Schools should develop and publicize their learning models.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I’ve visited many schools colleges and universities during my lifetime but am only aware of one that had a published learning model.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Learning models should focus on the steps expected of a learner in the teaching/learning process.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Having a learning model in place does not guarantee anything except that the organization has consciously thought about the learning process and that what a teacher does is deliberate.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>It only takes a few minutes to draft the first learning model; it will take a lifetime to perfect it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Take a few minutes noe to draw your “ideal” learning model – the one towards which you strive rather than your existing one.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>On the left hand side of a page, make a small box and insert the words "Student registers for class”.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>On the right side of the paper, draw another box and print the words “Student exits class”.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Now plot the steps that the learner takes between the entry and exit points.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The model will likely not be a straight line so one should show the options available to a learner at each step in the process.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Your model likely include such steps as student reviews course objectives, takes tests, prepares course papers, participates in class discussions, performs laboratory experiments, completes work placement, takes final examination, exits course without completion, receives course credit, etc. Remember , this is a learning model not a teaching model.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Some steps will be sequenced but the sequence suits the learner not the teacher. There should also be a fast lane.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>During the development process, ask yourself the following questions:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>What is the first required step?</p>
<p>Is the sequence the same for all learners?</p>
<p>How do you handle a learner who already knows most of the work</p>
<p>How do I know that a step is required by all?</p>
<p>What are the crucial points for my intervention?</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Answering the last question may take you back to your textbooks and to the latest journals. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>No doubt, your model will change as your knowledge and experience grows.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>At least mine did. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>With a learning model in place, it is now possible to develop a model of the teaching process.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Speakig personally, I be;oeve that aI would have been a beter teacher if I had a clearer understanding of how learners learn at the beginning of my teaching career.</p>
