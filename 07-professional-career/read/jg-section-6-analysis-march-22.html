  JG Section 6 Analysis (March 22)
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Section 6 (Analysis) of regulatory report on peanut/nut/sesame seed allergies on commercial aircraft for Canadian air carriers (appears to be formal government analysis). Document examines anaphylaxis risk, effectiveness of buffer zone accommodations, HEPA filtration, and recommends evidence-based mitigation measures. Don&#x27;s involvement suggests continued policy work in his later years, likely related to government consulting or advisory roles.</div>

<div class="reader-content">
<p>6. Analysis</p>
<p>As noted earlier, the Agency was asked to examine the issue of allergies to peanuts, nuts and sesame seeds for commercial air passengers in respect of domestic and international flights using aircraft with 30 or more passenger seats operated by Canadian air carriers and by foreign air carriers operating flights in and out of Canada, by looking into these two matters:</p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li1">The risk of anaphylaxis due to adverse contact with and/or ingestion of these allergens while on board the aircraft; and</li>
  <li class="li1">The effectiveness of current risk-mitigation measures, as outlined in the Allergy Decision.</li>
</ul>
<p>The research and evidence outlined in the previous sections of this report lead us to the answers to these two questions.</p>
<p>1. The risk of anaphylaxis due to adverse contact with and/or ingestion of these allergens while on board the aircraft</p>
<p>It is clear from both expert reports that the mostly likely route of exposure causing an allergic reaction that could lead to anaphylaxis onboard an aircraft is via accidental ingestion. Information presented in both the NRC Report and Dr. Greenhawt’s Report indicates that it is unlikely that peanut, nut, and sesame seed-based allergens can aerosolize and cause inhalation-based reactions. Dr. Greenhawt's Report notes while exposure via inhalation is commonly believed to be a route of exposure, there is no data to support this. Rather, data that does exist consistently shows that peanut allergens to not aerosolize; moreover, Dr. Greenhawt notes that there have been no oral or inhalation provocation studies to support the theory that nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal mucosal exposure can trigger an allergic reaction. It is possible, as the NRC report indicates, that allergic reactions attributed to inhalation<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>are being incorrectly attributed to unnoticed ingestion or dermal contact of allergens that have settled on surfaces..<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>In addition to the unlikelihood of an inhalation-based reaction, almost all large domestic air carriers operate newer generation aircraft using HEPA filters, with a combination of fresh and re-circulated air. Fresh air refers to outside air that is supplied into the aircraft cabin and passed through a ventilation system. The use of a HEPA filter in an aircraft is an effective means of reducing the level of particles circulating in the aircraft cabin environment. Typical HEPA filters have at least a 99.97% removal efficiency, and as noted in the NRC report, can remove particles of 0.3 microns in size. The NRC report noted that it is expected that peanut allergens would be removed through the filtration process on the first pass.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Typical room air exchange rates are higher in an aircraft than in other areas, such as a building (15-20 cycles per hour versus 12, on average), and the ventilation capacity is greater, at 4.7 liters per second., ,. Higher air exchange rates, as indicated by the NRC report, would theoretically reduce the level of peanut aeroallergens in the aircraft environment.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Smaller domestic air carriers tend to operate older and smaller aircraft such that HEPA filters are usually not present. Smaller aircraft generally supply 100% freshly circulated air into the aircraft cabin, and while some smaller aircraft, such as turboprop aircraft, are not equipped with filters, the same air exchange principles would apply as indicated above. Dr. Greenhawt's Report noted that the use of HEPA filters on an aircraft is not required by any government authority and that regardless of the size of the aircraft and the type of filtration system being used, no studies have proven that peanut, nut and sesame seed allergens circulate in an enclosed environment, such as an aircraft cabin.,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>An analysis of the information provided in the expert reports indicatesthe risk of anaphylaxis due to adverse contact with and/or ingestion of peanut, nut, and sesame seed-based allergens onboard an aircraft with 30 or more passenger seats is low. The evidence from both expert reports indicates that peanut, nut and sesame seed-based allergens do not aerosolize in the aircraft cabin, and do not readily circulate in the aircraft cabin environment, provoking an allergic reaction in passengers to these types of allergies.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>While there is a lack of scientific studies testing allergies in an aircraft cabin, both expert reports provided evidence to support the conclusion that the most likely route of exposure causing an allergic reaction that could lead to anaphylaxis onboard an aircraft is via accidental ingestion</p>
<p>2. The effectiveness of current risk-mitigation measures, as outlined in the Allergy Decision</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Current risk-mitigation measures as outlined in paragraph 64 of the Allergy Decision include:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>1. When at least 48-hour advance notice is provided to it by persons with disabilities due to their allergy to peanuts or nuts, Air Canada will create a buffer zone as follows for the passenger with a disability due to allergy to peanuts or nuts:</p>
<p><br></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li1">for international wide-body aircraft executive class seating, the buffer zone will consist of the pod-seat occupied by the person with a disability due to their allergy to peanuts or nuts;</li>
  <li class="li1">for North American business class seating, the buffer zone will consist of the bank of seats in which the person with a disability due to their allergy to peanuts or nuts is seated;</li>
  <li class="li1">for economy class seating, the buffer zone will consist of the bank of seats in which the person with a disability due to their allergy to peanuts or nuts is seated, and the banks of seats directly in front of and behind the person. In areas where a bulkhead is either directly in front of or behind the bank of seats in which the person with a disability due to their allergy to peanuts or nuts is seated, the buffer zone will consist of the bulkhead, together with the bank of seats in which the person is sitting and the bank of seats directly in front of or behind the person (depending on the location of the bulkhead).</li>
</ul>
<p>2. To only serve within the buffer zone snacks and meals which do not contain peanuts or nuts as visible or known components, but which may contain traces of peanuts or nuts as a result of cross-contamination.</p>
<p>3. To provide a briefing to passengers within the buffer zone that they must not eat peanuts or nuts, or foods which contain peanuts or nuts, and will only be served snacks and meals which do not contain peanuts or nuts.</p>
<p>In addition, in paragraph 86 of the Allergy Decision, the Agency recognized that persons who have allergies, whether at the severe end, or the less severe end of the spectrum, must take measures in their daily lives to mitigate the risks of accidental exposure to allergens; at the same time, the measures taken also assumed that persons with allergies to peanuts or nuts would, when travelling by air, take the precautions that they would normally take in their day-today lives.</p>
<p>While this order was specifically against Air Canada as a result of several allergy-related complaints against it, several other air carriers, as noted in Appendix XX, have implemented all, or a mix of the above-mentioned mitigation measures.. The number of allergy-related complaints against air carriers remains low since the issuance of the Allergy Decision. A couple of air carriers indicated a reduction of complaints, year over year, while others reported no complaints. Since 2013, the Agency has not issued any allergy-related decisions. <b>(Sue: I will check this in AppInfo, but I seem to recall Rosenbaum is the last formal complaint that is peanut/nut/sesame seed-related. I thought it would be useful to have this information to show that there are few complaints).<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p>While none of the major air carriers suggested changes to the mitigation measures outlined in the Allergy Decision, Air Canada recommended that, given both expert reports noted that there is no evidence that peanuts, nuts or sesame seeds can aerosolize, and that the risk of anaphylaxis is based on accidental ingestion or contact causing contamination and accidental ingestion, the buffer zone accommodation should be modified. Air Canada suggested that the buffer zone be limited to the bank of seat within which the passenger is sitting. This modification was also proposed by the Canadian Society of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, which stated that it would support defining the buffer zone as the row of seats the allergic passenger is seated in.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>As noted above, the mostly likely route of exposure causing an allergic reaction that could lead to anaphylaxis onboard an aircraft is via accidental ingestion. In establishing the buffer zone as the appropriate accommodation for persons with allergies to peanuts and nuts in the Allergy Decision, the Agency relied on information and evidence that was available at the time. Dr. Greenhawt’s Report, however, indicates that the effectiveness of a buffer zone, as described in the Allergy Decision, is an untested accommodation, is not used outside of Canada and the United States (only with a handful of US carriers and upon request), and more than likely does very little to reduce the risk of having an allergic reaction. It may, however, provide some psychological reassurance to passengers with allergies to peanuts, nut and sesame seeds.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Some allergy associations see value in the use of a buffer zone as a starting point for risk reduction, despite the noted lack of scientific evidence supporting its function. A number of allergy associations supported modifications to the buffer zone, either by extending the size or making it a fixed location on the aircraft. Only one association, the CSACI, viewed the buffer zone as mainly a psychological reassurance for the allergic passenger. This view echoes the observation made in Dr. Greenhawt’s Report that a buffer zone is likely a measure of comfort and psychological accommodation rather than a physiologic one.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Both expert reports noted positive correlations with reduced risk of exposure when some of the measures outlined in the Allergy Decision were employed, including the request of a buffer zone, the request of an announcement (whether in the buffer zone or cabin-wide), and requesting or receiving a nut-free meal. Other strategies that were identified in a 2013 conducted by Dr. Greenhawt include:</p>
<p><br></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li1">Making any request of the airline regarding accommodating a peanut/tree nut allergic traveller;</li>
  <li class="li1">Requesting a buffer zone (the extent of the buffer zone was not formally defined)*;</li>
  <li class="li1">Requesting an announcement that passengers not eat peanut/tree nut containing goods*;</li>
  <li class="li1">Requesting a peanut/tree nut free meal;</li>
  <li class="li1">Wiping their tray table;</li>
  <li class="li1">Brining their own food from home;</li>
  <li class="li1">Avoiding use of airline provided pillows; and</li>
  <li class="li1">Avoiding use of airline provided blankets</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p>*Denotes accommodation measures included in Allergy Decision</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>These strategies were presented as the most effective ones associated with lower odds of reporting an in-flight allergic reaction.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Dr. Greenhawt's Report also noted the success of surface wiping as abatement (wiping a seat or tray table, as noted above). Evidence that certain wipes and liquid/bar soaps were successful at removing peanut allergen particles smeared on various surface such as a table or countertop and even hands, demonstrates that proper cleaning can be an effective measure in reducing the risk of exposure to a peanut, nut or sesame seed-based allergen.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>…Based on the information provided by the experts, there is a lack of evidence regarding the effectiveness of, a buffer zone such as the one described in paragraph 64 of the Allergy Decision. Support from Air Canada, as well as the CSACI to reduce the size of the buffer zone is consistent with Dr. Greenhawt's recommendation that the buffer zone requirement be reevaluated.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Moreover, both expert reports suggest that alternative risk mitigation measures such as the ones noted in Dr. Greenhawt's Report, can successfully reduce the risk of exposure to peanuts, nuts and sesame seeds for passengers with such allergies. Several of these risk mitigation measures are consistent with some of the other measures noted in the Allergy Decision, and may in fact provide, as stated by Dr. Greenhawt, a superior or equivalent protection for passengers with allergies to peanuts, nuts and sesame seeds.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
