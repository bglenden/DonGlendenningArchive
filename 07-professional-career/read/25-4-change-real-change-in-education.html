  25-4  Change Real change in education
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">This foundational document outlines Don&#x27;s vision for meaningful educational transformation focused on learner outcomes rather than system structure. It emphasizes the critical need for change in PEI&#x27;s education system, advocating for outcome-based education, flexible scheduling, establishment of a separate qualification authority, and professional education advisors. Don contrasts the gap between what Islanders have and what they want in education, calling for immediate, significant, and continuous planned change. The document proposes bundled interventions including criterion-based assessment, flexible schedules enabling learners to progress at individual pace, and separation of teaching from qualification functions. Don positions himself as an experienced educator and concerned citizen ready to suggest practical improvements based on decades in the field.</div>

<p>Education is a lifelong process of participating in experiences that have a formative effect on the way we feel, think and act; this effect is usually expressed in terms of attitudes, skills and knowledge.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The process is called learning; the result is education.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Learning, and<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>thus our education, can take place anywhere and at any time and may arise from something we do, our family does, an organization we belong to or a school.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Schools play a unique role in our education in that they are the only provider of educational services allowed to award credentials, the folded paper, so esteemed by our society.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Partly because of this, people often think of schooling and education being the same; they’re not but the belief exists.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The practice of measuring<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>ed by years of formal education, is a key factor in determining one’s quality of life; in the same way, our collective education will determine to a significant degree the future of our community and country. Because of this, we are among the world leaders in our investment in education to ensure that our citizens, especially our youth, have access to quality educational activities and experiences that will enable them to participate fully in a changing world. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Our school system developed many years ago; times were different then to meet the educational needs of an earlier age but that age has disappeared; life long employment tending machines and systems has given way to rapidly changing economy with frequent swings, less certainty, greater demand for creativity, flexibility and mobility.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>While educators understand these changes, they remain locked into a delivery model they cannot seem to change.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There is a gap between what Islanders have and what they want in the way of education, a gap that is unlikely to make the desired changes by itself.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Not only is there a gap, but Islanders want meaningful engagement in bringing about the change. There is no panacea in sight and there is not likely to be one, however, change must be immediate, significant and continuous, but planned. Most comment is focused on changes to the school system, however, the issue is broader than that, it must encompass not only schools, but the broader education including the role of the home and community; any review must also include a variety of issues including expectations, the need for collaboration and engagement, credentials and standards, personal freedom and accountability.</p>

<p>The writer is a product of the Canadian system although albeit many years ago, a long time educator in a number of facets of the system, interested observer and still a concerned citizen. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Recent months has re-entered the education milieu and re-engaged in the education debate through reading, conversing, discussing, reflecting, and commenting upon the education scene, and now feels both able and compelled to suggest some changes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The proposed bundle of changes are not a <b>panacea,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>do<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>not deal with all the concerns, are short term, set change in motion, enable future changes but will, he is convinced, will have an almost immediate impact on schools and the quality of each learner’s educational experience. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>

<p><b>Any discussion about education must consider the impact on the learner; unless we get that right the rest is for nought, This bundle of changes<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>impact directly and quickly on learners and learning<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>learner in mind<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>about learners who may or may not be students</b></p>

<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li3">Outcomes</li>
</ul>
<p>Schools design programs based on outcomes, for schools these are often called exit outcomes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They identify what a student should know and be able to do by the end of Grade 12.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Individual courses and lessons<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>are developed to ensure that students meet the selected outcomes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The conversion from traditional subjects to outcomes was not easy; as a result many outcomes are not as well defined as they should be.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Outcomes need to be reviewed and restated so that they are clear and measurable; they also need community input.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Students should be given copies of outcomes so that they can put their current learning in perspective and track their progress ment and rating ver the yearsthose for students in the last year Update the OBE<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>model review, sharpen, put in hands of learner, basis for rating and reporting learner language, community input, measurable, definable<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li3">Criterion based assessment<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
</ul>
<p>Outcomes use performance criteria as a basis for assessment.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>These also need to be clear and relevant, they form the basis for providing<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>feed-back to learners and planning future learning.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They are also the basis of providing reports to parents.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li3">Qualifications<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
</ul>
<p>Sports organizations separate coaching and refereeing; we should do the same in education.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Instead, we put teachers in conflicting roles, that of assessing performance and sorting learners as though leducating is a competition.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It doesn’t mean that competition is not relevant it is simply that the one wo teaches should not be a judege in the case of his/her own students.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>What I’m suggesting is that the two functions be separated, that teachers teach and assess to improve learning.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That we establish a separate body, a qualification authority, to which people apply if they want a formal transcript or qualification.</p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li3">Flex schedules</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>– no two learners learn at same rate yet we organize around age and grade as though they were meaningful.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Students should be able to leave early or stay late until they reach their objectives</p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li3">Information and Education Advice</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>– professional, not connected to a particular school, not located in school facility, open, accessible,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
