<div class="reader-summary">Don&#x27;s introduction to DACUM Achievement manuscript, establishing DACUM as Canadian development with international impact. Argues the methodology deserves telling as historical record and practical tool for improving accountability, relevance, and outcomes-based education.</div>

<div class="reader-content">
<p>	INTRODUCTION</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>DACUM is Canadian; the termed was coined in Toronto?, the model was developed in Nova Scotia and applied in Prince Edward Island from where it has spread around the world.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>DACUM is a major Canadian success story but, like so many other Canadian developments, it gets little recognition, support of application in Canada.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The fact that DACUM is a Canadian development that has found international acceptance and acclaim is a sufficient reason itself for its telling.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In addition, however, the arrival of DACUM on the scene provided a highly credible yet inexpensive tool to identify desirable learning outcomes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Nothing has emerged to equal or replace it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But the story deserves telling for another reason in that, if adopted or even allowed in the school system at large, it could improve accountability, relevance, flexibility, and support outcomes based and learner centred education that the system espouses.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Full credit for the DACUM model described in this book goes to Robert Adams and the Nova Scotia NewStart Corporation, Yarmouth, Nova Scotia.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The writer has tried to be faithful to the model in the pages which follow.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Readers are encouraged, however, to read the original report if a copy can be found. Nevertheless, the writer is aware of modifications which have been made, but a description of any modifications is not part of this book.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>This document is neither a description of how to develop and use a DACUM chart nor the full DACUM methodology.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Neither does it describe in any detail the DACUM model of program development and student management.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is an historical document intended primarily to trace the evolutionary thread of DACUM during its early and formative years.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The heart of the document is a Chart (Figure 1) which attempts to show the sequence in which the early players became involved.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It also should deals with the two branches of DACUM in Canada during its first decade.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The paper limits itself to a period of less than a decade.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It picks up in the early 1960's and ends in the early 1970's.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As a result, it does not deal with the spread of DACUM methodology.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This could become the subject of a separate paper or a revision of this one.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The information in this paper was gathered from a number of sources and over a number of years.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Much was learned from various reports, articles and other documents.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A real insight into the early years, however, came only as a result of communication with people who were there.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Included in the search were the curriculum files of the British Columbia Department of Education in Victoria, Holland College, Canadian vocational,Association, documents borrowed from bowman, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><b>o	Talked with a number of people whose names are associated in some way with the DACUM process.	</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>o	Examined early copies of curriculum development charts and occupational analyses.</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>o	Shared early drafts of this paper with some people for review and comment.</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>As a result, the writer is satisfied that the information included in this report and conclusions reached generally reflect early events and significant roles.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This is said, however, with the full knowledge that some early participants may well remember events otherwise, and, in fact, events may have actually been different from that portrayed by the writer.</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>During the 1960's, the writer was a member of the Technical and Vocational Training Branch of the Federal Department of Labour in Ottawa and, later, the Department of Manpower and Immigration.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Some of the understanding of DACUM's evolution comes from that experience and from association with the people involved.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>However, that memory also is subject to both selectivity and dimming over time.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Much of the information in this book appeared first in two documents, <span>DACUM Roots</span> and <span>DACUM Described</span>.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The writer is grateful to many people, who provided information and insight into the early years of DACUM, including Howard Clement, Derek Franklin, Robert Adams, Lawrence Coffin, Keith Dunbar, Diane Morrison, Adrienne Burleigh, Robert Norton, Rick Embree, Vernon Mullin, Ralph Himsl, John Bateman, Stuart Conger and Doug Giddings.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Many other people provided information, encouragement, and editorial comment.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Barbara Reid gathered much of the initial information and prepared a bibliography.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Anne Hopkins provided secretarial assistance. ???</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Every effort was made to ensure the accuracy of this document, however, the writer takes full responsibility for any errors, omissions and misinterpretations which may have occurred.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Furthermore, the writer would welcome additional information and recollections on the roots of DACUM so that an even more complete and accurate record can be made.</p>
