  Educational vouchers
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Glendenning&#x27;s examination of educational vouchers as a market mechanism to improve education through competition and consumer choice. He finds the concept intriguing—students as consumers holding schools accountable through their funding choices and ability to leave. However, he notes vouchers remain experimental with inconclusive effectiveness data. He critiques limiting vouchers to poorly performing students, which stigmatizes the initiative. A genuine test, he argues, should provide vouchers universally, allowing all learners to vote with their feet regarding schools&#x27; effectiveness. The document reflects Don&#x27;s faith in market mechanisms and consumer power as educational improvement levers.</div>

<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The idea of educational vouchers is consistent with my philosophy; having said that, I have no experience with a voucher system.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The idea of the learner/client appearing at a school and plunking down money for services to be provided is intriguing.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The concept of the same student, getting up from their seat, walking to the principal’s office before departing a school with a refund in hand is even more interesting. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The voucher idea has been around for my entire educational career but seemed to rise in prominence in the 1970s and 80s.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I consider them still in the experimental stages.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Do they improve education?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The jury is still out.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Education vouchers involve a system whereby learners, or their parents, provides a voucher to a Scholl for part or all of the cost of providing an education.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Instead of a school receiving a g rant as part of a funding formula, the learner receives a voucher for all or part of the cost of his schooling.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The learner <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>chooses a school and gives the school a voucher.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The learner is a consumer, a consumer with the ability to pay.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The idea being that schools must compete for learners, that competition is good for other sectors why not for e education.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The end result is improved accountability and improved education.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>A major weakness that I have observed is that vouchers have been limited to poorly performing students.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This provides a negative image of the initiative.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Like placing less academically included students in vocational education.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A true test, I believe, should provide vouchers for all. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
