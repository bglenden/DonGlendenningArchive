<div class="reader-summary">This document presents general notes on educational innovation, specifically referencing Bishop Carroll High School in Calgary, Alberta. It discusses a self-paced, unit-based learning system where students attend lectures and work independently to achieve mastery through units rather than traditional class attendance. The document notes concerning statistics about literacy (42% may not graduate with adequate reading ability) and includes information from the GFK Trust Index 2010, which ranked firefighters, teachers, and doctors as the most trusted professionals in a survey of 19 countries. Educational principles emphasize beginning education before formal schooling starts.</div>

<p><b>General Notes</b><b></b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Have student/parents sign a paper saying that they understand that there is a 42 percent chance that their child will not read well enough to graduate.</b></p>
<p><b>John – and they pledge that their child will not be in that 42%</b></p>
<p><b>Education begins before school starts</b><b></b></p>
<p><b>Wikipedia reports:</b> In Calgary Alberta, Bishop Carroll High School has a system that is similar to university graduate school. At Bishop Carroll students do not attend classes like in many other high schools. They instead attended lectures and work at their own pace to achieve units. Each course as a set number of units which the student has to attain in order to get credit.</p>
<p>According to the GFK Trust Index 2010, a survey of citizens of 19 countries, firefighters have the greatest level of trust followed by teachers and doctors who are tied for second place.</p>
