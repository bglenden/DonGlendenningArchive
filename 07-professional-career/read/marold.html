<p>Wolf and Leilo:</p>
<p>Great to see you last week but sorry my visit was so rushed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Here are some further thought on our conversation:</p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li2"><b>Formal notification about pension</b> - I did not see mention of any penalty for not returning the form to Germany other than they would suspend payment of the pension.</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li2"><b>Volume One of your book</b> – I checked three places about having your book printed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>All recommended that it be retyped first.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Should be able to find a typist at $15.00 an hour but am not sure of the number of hours required to type the volume.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Although you have already typed Volume One, there are quite a few additional hand written notes to be inserted. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p>After the typing, the relevant photos need to be scanned and inserted in the appropriate place on the relevant pages, then a copy made for your review.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My thinking is that we set a limit of, say, $500 and see what we can do with it both in terms of typing and editing. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>At that point, we will have a better feel for the final document and the costs involved.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I’ll send a copy of one of my reports so that you can see how I handled photographs.</p>
<p><br></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li2"><b>Proposed Marold Fund – </b>we had spoken during an earlier visit about an endowment fund at the Community Foundation that would provide grants on an annual basis to the PEI Humane Society.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I left a copy of our standard agreement which provides for a contribution now and allows for additional contributions later. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p>If, as you indicated, you want the residue of your estate to pass to the Community Foundation you need to consult your lawyer about an appropriate clause in each of your wills.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The following is an example of such a clause:</p>
<p><i>I, Wolfgang Marold, transfer and convey to the Community Foundation of Prince Edward Island ________ % of the residue (or a specific amount) as a contribution to the Dr. Wolfgang and Leilo Marold Endowment Fund for the purpose of making annual grants to the PEI Humane Society.</i></p>
<p>I’ll be out of Province for a couple of weeks.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When I get back, I’ll be in touch.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Regards</p>
<p>Don</p>
