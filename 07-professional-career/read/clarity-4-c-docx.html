<div class="reader-summary">Near-identical letter to File 18, containing same argument about PEI&#x27;s education/schooling conflation and Department&#x27;s narrow focus. Appears to be second draft or alternate version with identical core content and identical urging for immediate mission clarity and community conversation initiation. Both versions emphasize schools as resource locations (comparing to hospitals/spas) and argue services delivered matter more than facilities themselves.</div>

<p><b>Dear Editor:</b></p>
<p><b>A Call For Clarity - 4</b></p>
<p><b>Dear Editor</b></p>
<p><b>Education is complex. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Learners have different interests, capabilities, experiences and needs; They also fill a number of life roles, that of an Individual, family member, citizen, student, consumer and producer; education is needed or may help with any and all.</b></p>
<p><b>Education is also an umbrella word; a person’s education includes all the experiences that have changed a life and is demonstrated by our actions; Our education depends, to a large degree, on our experiences at home, in our community, through travel, interactions with others, personal exploration and roles we play in life. A good education has been described as one that provides a person with the knowledge, skills. attitudes and other attributes needed to deal with circumstances that confront us in our- every day lives; but there are other definitions as well<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>An education system consists of programs and services put in place to organize and deliver education services; typical tools of change include information, instruction; diagnosis, counselling, quality control, products and technology.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b>Schools are an important component of any education system; they focus on instruction.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Attendance is required by law. Like a hospital or spa, schools are purpose-built facilities that house the people and services needed to support education. Having a well-equipped school is important but it is the service that impacts one’s education. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b>It is said that education should help us develop the attitudes. skills, knowledge and other attributes that will allow us to thrive in later life but, to borrow a phrase from a sister Province, should each child leave school “having mastered the tools to learn”?</b></p>
<p><b>Sincerely</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>

<p><b>Based on its documents and compared to other Provinces, The Department of Education is sending mixed messages about its educational interests, services and plans.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li1"><b>It seems to treat education and school attendance s though they are one and the same</b></li>
  <li class="li1"><b>Developing and <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>delivering programs misses he importance of the change process</b></li>
  <li class="li1"><b>Structure<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Outcomes<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Graduation requirements Education frequently treat going to school and getting an education as though they are one and the same; that happens in PEI as well. In fact, most public articles about education only deal with school matters. Until we recognize the difference and put education on our agenda, we are not likely to get the education that Islanders want and need. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b>but they are seldom if ever mentioned. Although called a Department of Education, its actions are mostly limited to running schools, to the teaching function and to the young. The goal, as found on the website. of “developing and delivering programs and curriculum” is more suitable for a curriculum division than for a Department of Education.</b></p>
<p><b>I urge the Department to review, clarify and restate its mission, goals, objectives and guiding principles.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Conversations about education should be encouraged. I cannot think of anything more urgent, or a better team building activity – and starting that process should begin immediately</b></p>
<p><b>Sincerely<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
