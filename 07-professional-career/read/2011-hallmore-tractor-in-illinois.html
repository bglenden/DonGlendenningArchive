<p><b>The Search in Illinois<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b>by Don Glendenning<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>

<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>Hall and Stavert was a partnership of Harold Hall and Stanley Stavert established in Charlottetown the 1930s.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They operated a foundry and produced equipment primarily for the agricultural and fishing industry.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Around 1940, they produced a conversion tractor...</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Most farm tractors were purpose built, however, during the 1920-1930 period, a number of companies built conversion kits that allowed a farmer to convert his auto (whether a Model A, Chevrolet, Oakland or whatever) so that it could be used as a tractor.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The conversion kit usually consisted of a sturdy rear axle with rear wheels having strong cleats/lugs and was bolted to the car front end just behind the transmission. It was sometime referred to as the poor man’s tractor.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Although aware of conversion tractors generally, I only became aware that such equipment was manufactured in PEI in 2004 or 2005 through a conversation with Jim Stavert, son of one of the founders of the company.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Jim told me of a phone call from a Mr. Heim from Chicago enquiring about Hall and Stavert. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Mr. Heim did not respond to Jim’s Email, however, a search of the internet and found an address for Mr. Heim, 15065 Bruce Road, Lockport, Illinois, 6049. (Home:815-838-5015; Work: 708-496-7450; Cell;708-372:7721)</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The scene shifts to a summer evening in 2006 at my cottage and a conversation with a neighbour, Dr. Arleon Kelley, now living in Elgin, Iowa.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Knowing that Dr. Kelley traveled frequently on Interstate 80 between Iowa and Indiana, and that Mr. Heim lived outside Chicago and close to that highway, I wondered if Arleon would visit Mr. Heim if the opportunity arose.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>On Arleon’s return to Iowa at the end of the summer, he and his wife took time to look up Mr. Heim.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Through a telephone call and later correspondence I learned more about the visit.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Arleon pulled into the Lockport home and, fortunately, Mrs. Heim was home early that day.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>After a drive of an additional 20 or thirty miles, Arleon met Mr. Heim at the family business – a manufacturing plant now being closed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Heim had a large collection of tractors including a black and red Hallmore tractor conversion on an Oakland chassis; in Arleon’s words, it was<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>”in nearly mint condition.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Heim’s tractors were being prepared for storage but eventually are going to a museum under construction in Michigan City, Indiana planned for a 2007 opening.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Unfortunately, Dr. Kelley had left his camera in PEI and, therefore, was not able to take a photo.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As Dr. Kelley was departing the younger Mr. Heim said in effect “now Dad, we know where that tractor will go” <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>‘On September 12, 2006 I sent an email to Mr. Heim referring to Arleon’s visit and asking for information about the tractor but did not receive a reply; sometime later I attempted a call to Mr. Heim but he was not available and I did not leave a phone number.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>In August 2008, I convened a meeting of Jim Stavert and Tom Hall, sons of the original founders of Hall and Stavert Manufacturing and Dr. Kelley who had actually seen the tractor, to meet with myself and Dr. David Keenleyside, recently appointed Executive Director of the PEI Museum and Heritage Foundation, <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>with a view to identifying what steps, if any, could/should be taken to bring the Hallmore tractor back to PEI.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Although some efforts have been made as of the date of this memo, no concrete results are in evidence.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My most recent attempt was a telephone call leaving a message on the home phone of Mr. Heim, followed by an Email, requesting a photo (tractorglenn50@aol.com.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Neither message was acknowledged.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>In September 2008, I received<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>the following email fro Arleon: “I am doing the research to find where Heim may have located his new warehouse in or around Michigan City, IN.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I have the Chamber, the Mayor's office and the County development office researching it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>None<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>of these knew immediately.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>So I did not stop on our way through yesterday.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I will be through Michigan City at the end of the first week in October and will stop and do some leg work then.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Land<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>transfers and leases are recorded in the County court house, so that<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>would be the last resort.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Mr. Google and I have not found anything on<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>the Internet”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Recent information from an internet search finds that Mr. Heim of the Heim Group, had a company, the Service Machine Company, that machined parts for the military in the 1940’s; it may not even be the same Heim as heads the company today; <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>in the 1950’s and 1960’s he manufactured heavy presses, sold out that part of the business but bought it back<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>in the 1980’s and operated it in a facility Bedford Park, near Midway airport.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That is the facility<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>that Arleon visited but, based on his visit, that may have been sold hence the plan to move the tractors to Michigan City.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Mr. Heim also had a facility in Frankfort, Illinois but I do not know if he still owns it.  In Arleon’s words, Mr. Heim is a “crusty old sou” so we wondered if there would be more potential working with a son.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Unfortunately, however, we do not have the name of the son.</p>
