<div class="reader-summary">Don explores the fundamental distinction between &quot;education&quot; and &quot;going to school,&quot; arguing they are often conflated. He notes that the World Bank warns against treating these as synonymous, yet the practice persists broadly. Don defines education as encompassing life experiences in home, school, and life itself, and argues a good education prepares people for everyday life decisions. He criticizes the absence of definitions in provincial education literature and compares nonprofits in health (more focused on health issues) versus education, suggesting education lacks definitional clarity present in other sectors.</div>

<p><b>EDUCATION</b></p>
<p><b>Doc 5 clarity</b></p>
<p><b>Education has a clarity problem and it is interfering with our ability to upgrade the educational level of our citizens. And it is not limited to Prince Edward Island</b></p>
<p><b>Take the matter of education. Many people believe that going to school and getting or having an education are one and the same. In fact, the length of time in school is frequently used as a measure uof one’s education. I don’t believe it; neither does the World Bank. But the belief continues.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b>Education is an umbrella term; it is the result of our life experiences, first in the home, then in school and finally in life itself. Being educated means different things to different people. It is suggested that a good education is one that prepare you to make everyday life decisions.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Definitions are hard to come by in the education literature; I’ve googled a number of Provinces without success.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I’ve also searched other provinces, CMEC, CAMET and the CEA. Whether or not<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I agree is not an issue, the fact that definitions are missing from provincial literature is another.</b></p>
<p><b>The practice of dealing with education under a school umbrella is diverts or detracts from the business at hand; Iif done deliberately would be considere a questionable practice.</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>A few wees ago, while discussing tis matter with a friend, he pulled out his phone tcck the number and nature of nonprofits first in education and ten in health. Non profits in health greatly outnumbered those in education but, more telling, yhose in health were more focused on the issues of health . In conversation with a different friwnd on another occasion it<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>became obvius that</b></p>
