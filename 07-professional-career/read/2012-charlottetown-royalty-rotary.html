<p><b>Charlottetown Royalty Rotary</b></p>
<p><b>Mentor Award</b></p>
<p><b>November 21, 2012</b></p>
<p><b>President Catherine, Rotarians, Friends All</b></p>
<p><b>Thank you, Norman, for your kind and generous words, and thanks to the Charlottetown Royalty Rotary Club for the honour you have bestowed upon me.</b></p>
<p><b>While my mother taught me many things, how to respond to this kind of generosity was not one of them.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>All I know to say, therefore, is thank you, thank you, thank you.</b></p>
<p><b>While the award is given in my name, I would like to recognize the many people who enabled whatever I was able to do. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li2"><b>First on the list is my wife, Carol, who tended our home and cared for our two children while I did my thing.</b></li>
  <li class="li2"><b>Then there were the many colleagues at Holland College, at the Community Foundation, and other organizations with whom I worked.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Among my list would be literally hundreds of Islanders who served in a variety of advisory roles in the development of Holland college programs.</b></li>
</ul>
<p><b>In 1968, we were living in Ottawa when I came to the conclusion that it was time for a change.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Two opportunities came to my attention, one in the west coast and the other in the east, and both were to bring a new college on stream.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>An offer came first from the west; it didn’t fit right, I turned it down.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Then an offer came from PEI.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I accepted.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My wife often remarked that she knew, when I returned from my interview in Charlottetown, if offered, that was the position I would accept.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The Island was welcoming and I was impressed with the College Planning Committee and their commitment to the challenge of providing an alternative form of education for the youth of PEI.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b>At the time, we thought that we would be here for 3-5 years and then move along.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But the Island has a way of taking contro, and here we are some 45 years later</b></p>
<p><b>As I have said before, I am in awe of the generosity of Islanders, and as a past Rotarian, I know of at least some of your community activities.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I commend and thank you; our community is the richer for your many contributions.</b></p>
<p><b>Again, I thank the Charlottetown Royalty Rotary Club, for the Mentor award and through you, the people of Prince Edward Island for your welcome and support.</b></p>
