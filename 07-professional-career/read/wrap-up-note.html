<p>Memo to Directors:</p>
<p>May 29. 2018</p>
<p><span><b>Education ward-2019</b></span></p>
<p>The 2018 Award was presented today to Jason Campbell, Emily Perry and Terry Nabuurs of Bluefield High School; we should now begin planning for 2019</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The purpose of the award varies<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>from year to year.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The first two awards recognized engagement, the third recognized the application of technology throughout a school and last one recognized the wonders of mathematics, a program to demystify mathematics. The 2018 Award was for collaboration and was presented to Bluefield High School.</p>
<p>Recommendations:</p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li1">Terms of Reference for the Committee be reviewed and reconfirmed</li>
  <li class="li1">The theme for 2018 has potential again for 2019; In discussion at Bluefield High today, however, the idea of community wellness” came up today as an alternative theme.</li>
  <li class="li1">Before deciding next year’s theme, it might be interesting to solicit comments from previous award winners <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li1">Although we spoke of an award to the Duffy’s , no award has been presented to date,</li>
  <li class="li1">We have always given the award to something already accomplished; the idea of a small grant to help a school “do” something should not be ruled out.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If this were the case, proposers could even make a presentation to Education 20/20 bout their plans</li>
</ul>
