  Reading clinics
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">An outline document addressing reading instruction as Don&#x27;s lifelong concern (60 years of observation since first teaching). Don emphasizes reading as essential, learnable, and solvable through known approaches, requiring outside-the-box thinking. He identifies key elements: diagnosis, prescription, instruction, supervised practice, and unsupervised practice. Don advocates for reading as a separate educational subject and specialty, operated like dental or eye clinics with reading specialists and clinicians. The document notes reading instruction should operate within or outside the system, formatted as brief bullet points and topic headers suggesting work-in-progress thinking about reading clinic implementation and organization.</div>

<div class="reader-content">
<p><b>READING</b></p>
<p>Over my lifetime, including my recent discussions, no subject comes up more often than the subject of reading and especially the level of reading demonstrated by our graduates.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It has been a concern for years, I recall even during my first year of teaching, discussions with experienced teachers about approaches to teaching the subject.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Some 60 years later, it still sparks controversy.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Given the above, I believe it is worthy of at least one letter to the editor.</p>
<p>Let me hasten to add that reading is not a specialty of mine but I believe it to be an essential skill, that most people can learn to read at a reasonable level, and that we know how to solve the problem.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In so doing, we may have to think outside the box.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I know that there are other important skills but want to stick with reading not literacy</p>
<p>Should be an educational specialty and separate subject in school</p>
<p>Diagnosis, prescription, instruction, supervised practice, unsupervised practice</p>
<p>Cries out for change</p>
<p>Reading clinics – inside or outside the system</p>
<p>Set up like a dental clinic or an eye clinic: reading specialist, testing/assessmentreading clinicians,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
