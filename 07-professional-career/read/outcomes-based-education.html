  Outcomes Based Education
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Don presents himself as a believer and practitioner in outcomes-based education, noting his direct experience with competency-based systems. He comments on browsing internet sources to update himself on OBE trends and expresses disappointment that educational emphasis has shifted from true outcomes to curriculum-based objectives. Don critiques the Atlantic Provinces Learning Outcomes as neither true competencies nor educational outcomes but rather curriculum outcomes. He references the Oregon Life Roles framework (individual, learner, producer, consumer, family member, citizen) as the proper foundation for identifying outcomes. Don argues that outcomes development should originate from community/occupational sources rather than textbooks, and he calls on the Department of Education to redesign outcomes to meet proper criteria of clarity, unambiguity, and relevance.</div>

Sound educational planning demands it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Clear, unambiguous and measurable outcomes are the place to start. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>My experience was with competency based education; you can imagine my delight listened to William Spady.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We were talking the same language.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Granted competencies were more specific but I feel that the detail is needed. A tighter specification is needed to properly plan activities and interventions, hence my preference for the term competency.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>A competency is a statement of observable behaviour resulting from the application of knowledge to the solution of a problem or situation.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It follows then that competency based education is an approach to organizing educational programs and activities that clearly identifies what is to be learned and various levels of achievement.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>I browsed the internet recently to update myself on outcomes based education.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Imagine my disappointment to learn that, although many still confess to be using an OBE model, in fact the emphasis has switched to curriculum based objectives. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>My later browsing of the objectives as found in the PEI curriculum outlines confirms the general trend.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Atlantic Provinces Learning outcomes are, in my view, nneither competencies of educational outcomes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They are, as the literature said, curriculum outcomes.</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><span><b>In issue No. 1, I mentioned the six Oregon Life Roles: </b></span><b>individual, learner, producer, consumer, family member and citizen.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is my view that program planners and curriculum developers should, therefore, look to those sources to identify in some detail the nature, range and depth of skills expected in each role.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It seems to me that those identifying outcomes went o books instead. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>I believe that going to text books is an important part of education but that is a second step not the first step.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Text books are useful in helping you organize<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span></b><span><b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></span></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>This was borne out in my review of<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>browsed some for the PEI language arts outcomes recently and find that than many outcomes do not pass the test, or at least my grading of that test. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Outcomes are central to the teaching/learning process and<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>should determine the what, when and where of a teacher’s daily, monthly and yearly teaching plans. Those same outcomes should form the basis for reporting student progress.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Some redesign, new materials and fresh signage is called for.</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Most educators in the public school system reject competency based education in favour of<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>the Spady model of based on educational outcomes. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In fact, however, they operate on neither educational outcomes or competencies but rather a hybrid that I view as curriculum objectives.</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Responsibility for the above repairs rests clearly with the Department of Education and, I should point out, can be carried out at minimal cost and interference with the ongoing operation of the system.</b></p>
