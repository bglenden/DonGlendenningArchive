  D 2016-Independent assessment 
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Policy advocacy piece proposing separation of testing and grading from teaching function. Glendenning observes employers find high school graduation inadequate indicator of essential skills. He argues grading inconsistencies arise from variable assessment practices and proposes independent assessment organization separate from schools, comparable to apprenticeship models. References international qualification frameworks in developed countries. This sophisticated policy argument demonstrates his systematic thinking about assessment reform and his willingness to propose structural changes to educational systems.</div>

<span lang="en-US">Some employers are wondering if they should have
job applicants take an achievement test before offering them a job;
some employers already do.  The reason is simple.  Employers find
that “high school graduation” is not an adequate measure of 
basic skills, especially such skills as measurements, writing work
reports, making change, mental arithmetic, reading maps or giving
directions. When asked what math skills should be taught, one
employer replied “Teach them logic”.  The skills people
identified are also referred to as essential skills, employability
skills or even the “skills of everyday living”. </span>

<span lang="en-US">Many employers ask for “high school graduation”
in their advertisements, but that’s too large a “mesh” thinks
Dr. Don Glendenning, President of Education 20/20 Inc. “there are
too many variables in the way school grades are determined for that
to work: confusion between school grades and  achievement level,
wording of outcome statements, social promotion, assessment process,
rating scales and the nature of benchmarks, to name but a few.”
Glendenning thinks that grading should be separated from schools,
removed from teaching responsibilities and handled by an independent
organization – “the way we do with apprenticeship.”  </span>

<p lang="en-CA" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">
<span lang="en-US">Glendenning came to the realization that testing
and grading were separate functions about a year ago in conversation
with a group of students about the kind of help they needed with
their learning.  “We plotted student comments in the form of a flow
chart or path and the separation between teaching and grading became
crystal clear.”  A simple achievement test would likely give most
employers all they need to know to make employment decisions. Most
developed countries, other than Canada and the USA, have national
qualification framework help solve these kind of issues.</span></p>

<p lang="en-CA" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">
<span lang="en-US">In the meantime, Glendenning suggests that, if new
employees are expected to write reports, employers could ask for a
copy of their marks on writing and communications; that should tell
more than high school graduation.</span></p>
