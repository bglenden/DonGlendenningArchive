  Issues. 100
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Comprehensive issues inventory establishing ten key problem areas for PEI education: terminology confusion (World Bank 2018), purpose ambiguity (&quot;place&quot; in society), service invisibility, structural organization (&quot;form follows function&quot; principle), teacher autonomy needs, accountability mechanisms, collaborative deficiencies, system vs. school distinctions, fear factor barriers, and information/documentation gaps. Dated 06/12/23, includes Glendenning attribution. Structured as bullet-pointed analysis suitable for policy presentations. References Paul Bennett on teacher isolation, Matthew Bedard&#x27;s autonomy-accountability framework. Advocates for public discussion before implementation. Comprehensive yet accessible format suggests use for stakeholder engagement.</div>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 108%"><b>Key issues
include:</b></p>
<ol>
	<li><p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.11in">Terminology
	– a common terminology improves communication throughout the
	organization; the most obvious, according to the World Bank, in the
	practice of using  the terms “education” and ‘going to school”
	interchangeably.</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0in"><b>Purpose
	</b>– purpose<b>
	</b>sets the stage for
	what we do and how we organize to do it. The
	PEI education literature refers to helping people find “a place”
	in society’; we need to better define that “place”.  People
	are said to fill six life roles, that of an individual, citizen, a
	producer, a consumer, family member and student. All roles can
	benefit from education but all may not need the same amount mix or
	time. 
	</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0in"><b>services
	</b><b>–
	</b>although<b>
	</b>education is a
	service, services are seldom mentioned; sub-services include:
	information, counselling, instruction, products and technology,
	quality assurance. governance, funding and human resources. Learners
	may need any or all services at any point in their education
	journey. 
	</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0in"><b>Structure
	</b><b>-</b>”Form
	follows function” is the standard when structuring any venture.
	Departments of Education, however, appear to structure around
	clients served.</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0in"><b>Autonomy
	- </b><b>f</b><b>ront
	line service providers (teachers) need both expertise and autonomy
	to respond to learner needs.</b>
	<b>The OECD tells us
	that PISA results are better for students in schools with autonomy
	for their day-to-day operation.</b></p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0in"><b>Accountabilities
	 -</b><b>
	Mathew Bedard of the Montreal Economic Institute points out that
	“autonomy and accountability jointly applied” would cost
	practically nothing and allow education to better adapt to the
	diversity of student needs and aptitudes. </b>
	</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0in"><b>Collaboration
	</b><b>– the
	literature tells us that education thrives on collaboration and
	communication; Paul Bennet speaks of the “muffled voices of
	teachers” who work alone in classrooms, in fact the profession
	itself, sems to operate as a silo in the community. </b>
	</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0in"><b>Education
	system –</b><b>
	Although Provinces generally refer to their education systems, the
	writer’s review found mostly school systems.</b></p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0in"><b>Fear
	factor – </b><b>although
	the “fear factor” may be too strong a term, the writer has
	encountered a number of instances that support it’s existence.</b></p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0in"><b>Information
	– </b><b>system
	documation  and research findings are important components of
	in-sevice education.</b></p></li>
</ol>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 108%"><b>These
issues are not new; no doubt readers have others to propose. All
should be considered. They need to be dealt with soon, and should be
dealt with in a public manner.</b></p>
