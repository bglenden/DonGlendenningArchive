  A 3 A Snow Job
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Don critiques blanket school closures during winter storms as administratively convenient but educationally disruptive and disrespectful of parental authority. He observes that PEI weather is unpredictable and that many students walk or are driven to school and could attend safely despite storms. Don argues that schools should remain open and parents should decide whether their children attend based on individual circumstances and information. He identifies the various stakeholders (parents, bus drivers, school facilities staff, teachers) and their respective responsibilities. Critically, he notes that treating all students as identical ignores the reality that students operate at different levels and learn at different paces. Don concludes that school closures reflect an inability to accommodate individual differences rather than genuine safety necessity.</div>

<p>20 – A Snow Job</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>When I first moved to PEI, I lived directly across the street from a Registered Nurse who worked, I was told, in the operating room of the local hospital; about 6:00 am each morning, she would leave her house and walk to the hospital in fair weather or foul.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>About the same time, the local radio would announce school closings because of snow, ice, or high winds.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Frequently, by 9:00 am the storm would have subsided or not developed and traffic along our street would be almost normal.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And shortly thereafter, children would be building forts or tunnels, or pelting snowballs at passers by. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Schools closings are usually based on a concern for student safety; that I understand.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There are days when it may not be safe for anyone to be on the road except emergency vehicles.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>On such days, buses should not venture out either – but all students do not arrive at school by bus.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Many students walk to school, others are dropped off at school by parents; some may even have their own vehicles while others may be transported by parents even on fine days.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Why should schools be closed to these students?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My own children, for example, walked to school and could have done so even on stormy most days.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>In closing schools, the education system is taking away (another) decision that should, in my view, be made by parents.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A school closing policy is not as simple as schools closing or staying open; there are many interested parties and actual decision makers; each has an interest in the issue.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>To name a few:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Parents have the ultimate decision as to whether a child goes to school on any day – and that is as it should be.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That decision is based on a range of information including the child’s safety.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The fact that the day is stormy or that a bus is not operating is only part of the decision-making process – but it is a parent’s decision.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Even if the bus runs, a parent may make a decision not to send a child – and that is as it should be.</p>
<p>Bus drivers or their supervisors have a responsibility to authorize a bus to travel or not to travel; the reasons for not turning out are many and one is road and weather conditions; another could be a faulty bus.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There are days when individual school buses should not be on the road but I am not convinced that there are many days when all buses must be kept off Island roads.</p>
<p>There may be days when the facility itself should be closed because of such things as a broken water pipe, lack of power, a non-functioning furnace, etc. but weather would seldom be one of them.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I assume such decisions are taken by the school principal, but I am not sure.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>School maintenance and support staff know the location of the school and know the unpredictability of PEI weather when they accept employment.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>From time to time, an employee may not be able to reach the place of employment because of weather but it would be rare indeed if all staff were unable to be there.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Frequent inability to be at work would likely have consequences.</p>
<p>Teachers are expected to be in school each day and on arrival should find the facility to be open, comfortable and safe.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Knowing nearby students are expected to attend, demands that teachers also be present.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Officially closing a school, I am told, means that teachers get paid for that storm day. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If the school is open and they cannot be present, could result in the loss of a day’s pay.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>While we need to be reasonable about anybody missing a day or part of a day under these circumstances, frequent absences should have consequences.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Any time the matter of school closings comes up in a discussion, it is accompanied by the question of how to deal with students who do not make it to school that day.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Well, how do you accommodate a student who is is sick for a day or two? <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The myth that all students are at the same level is a myth.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is well known that students in the same grade or class operate at a variety of levels.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My reading suggests that some students may be a couple of grades ahead and others a couple of grades behind in any subject – and those who are ahead in one subject may be behind in another.<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Teachers may deliver the same lesson to a class but we are fooling ourselves if all receive and deal with it the same way.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>So how are these students accommodated?</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Schools have to become better at dealing with students as individuals.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There is no such thing as group learning <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Individuals may, however, learn in a group setting.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Many schools find it difficult to accommodate individual differences - but I will leave that issue for another paper.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Closing schools on stormy days is administratively convenient but I believe is disruptive to students and learning.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The decision to attend or not attend on any given day is that of a stud3ents or parent.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I believe that teachers are quite able to deal with students in a much disruptive way.</p>
