  2014 Response from Bridge
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">September 5, 2014 response from legal counsel Richard Bridge to Don&#x27;s Question 11 draft, offering technical advice: use &quot;purposes&quot; not &quot;objectives&quot;; follow CRA sample wording; avoid references to &quot;policy makers&quot; (potential political content); provide 4-5 pages of prose rather than bullets; and study CRA guidance on charitable purposes and political activities. Professional legal guidance on navigating CRA requirements.</div>

<p><b>Response from Bridge</b></p>
<p>Good evening Don,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Here are some initial thoughts: </p>
<p><br></p>
<p>1. CRA is interested in your "purposes" and activities. The word "purposes" is also used in the Canada Not-for-profit Corporations Act under which you are incorporated. Your purposes appear in your Articles of Incorporation and Articles of Amendment when you revise them. They are the formal legal words that define what you are all about. </p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I recommend you not use the words "objective," "mission" or "vision." This causes confusion for the CRA. </p>
<p><br></p>
<p>2. Have you studied the CRA's sample purposes wording? Here is a link <span>http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/chrts-gvng/chrts/pplyng/mdl/mdl-bjcts-eng.html</span> that gives examples of what they look for. They are very particular about the way the purposes are crafted. I recommend you follow the samples as closely as possible.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>3. CRA  may not like your reference to policy makers in your purposes. They may consider it to be a political purpose, which is prohibited. Here is the guidance that addresses this topic: <span>http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/chrts-gvng/chrts/plcy/cps/cps-022-eng.html</span></p>
<p><span></span><br></p>
<p>4. I think the CRA will want more than bullets describing your activities. I generally craft 4 or 5 pages of prose to tell the story completely and clearly. </p>
<p><br></p>
<p>That's all for now.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Richard</p>
