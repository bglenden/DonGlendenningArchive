<p><span>Re: Garth Staples</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>This letter comes to support the nomination of Garth Staples, 62 Ambrose Street, Charlottetown, PE C1A 3P7<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>to the Senate of Canada, a man who I have known personally for nearly 40 years. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Garth is a person of many accomplishments including private business, municipal and provincial government, running for public office, and community and service organizations.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He remains active in many local organizations and networks.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>For purposes of this letter, I comment on only a couple of his accomplishments.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Garth played a leading role in the establishment of The Culinary Institute of Canada, an institution based in PEI that has become successful on the world stage.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Some 30 years ago, Garth as Deputy Minister of Tourism in PEI, initiated discussions about the need to improve food service for the tourism industry.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As the initiative developed, Garth marshaled support in the industry, community and within all levels of government.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The Culinary Institute of Canada has had a significant impact on the quality of food service in PEI, increased the level of competence of the food service workforce well beyond our borders, bought international recognition to Canada through the gold medals in many competitions, and opened new opportunities to hundreds of young people from PEI, Canada and elsewhere.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>About four years ago, Garth assumed a leadership role in an initiative to thank and recognize the contributions of many citizens of the USA to the life of Prince Edward Island – especially those who return each year to their summer homes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As a result, for each of the last three years, upwards of 200 US citizens have gathered in Charlottetown on July 4 to celebrate Independence Day with friends.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>For each of the last two years, the US consul General from Halifax was in attendance.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The impact of that event can be seen in the flow of support for cultural and charitable activities in Prince Edward Island.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Garth knows how to harness the efforts of others towards a common objective.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He is well organized but low key.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He is prepared to make both recommendations and decisions and not afraid to voice opinions that may differ from the majority.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Aside from his accomplishments, he is a worthy gentleman and he and his wife make a fine couple.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I am pleased to support his nomination and believe that Garth would be an excellent member of the Senate and representative of our community.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Donald E. M. Glendenning, C.M.</p>
