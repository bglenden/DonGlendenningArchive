  05 Standards A Real Test
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">A comprehensive examination of how schools should define and measure success through exit expectations. Glendenning argues that schools exist to help learners become better individuals, learners, producers, consumers, family members, and citizens. Rather than traditional discipline-based organization, he advocates for identifying key skills—particularly communication—and assessing students based on actual performance. He references Michigan&#x27;s competency-based graduation requirements as a model, emphasizing outcomes like proficiency in communication, technology use, critical thinking, and personal responsibility. This document establishes the framework for competency-based assessment.</div>

<p><b>SCHOOL STANDARDS – 101</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Exit Expectations – the Last Test</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>We’ve established schools as a resource for people who want to be better in the roles they will fill in adult life in their communities, that is better individuals, learners, producers, consumers, family members and citizens.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Schools provide a protective and supportive environment where learners are allowed and encouraged to improve existing skills and learn new ones.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It’s a tall order. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Traditionally schools organize instruction around disciplines; students are required to gain credits in a variety of subjects in order to graduate from high school including language arts, mathematics, science, social studies, art, physical education and health, technology and some electives.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>With aknowlede of a range of disciplines we infer that students will have the needed skills. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>An alternative, and a better way, is to identify key skills and, based on performance, to infer that they rest on a sound foundation.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The ability to communicate comes quickly to mind and, in the writer’s view, is key to success in all life roles.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Schools certainly can provide such help but schools cannot be everything to everybody.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Choices will be required.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The State of Michigan, on the other hand, states their high school graduation requirements as (State of Michigan on August 22, 1990):</p>
<p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Students will be proficient in listening, speaking, reading, writing, mathematics, and the use of technology.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Students will apply knowledge, concepts, and processes acquired through the study of the arts, sciences, and social sciences.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Students will demonstrate a healthy self-esteem.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Students will select and use thinking skills, individually and in groups, to solve problems and to make decisions.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Students will be able to find, evaluate and use information.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Students will demonstrate respect and co-operation within a community of individual and cultural differences.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Students will demonstrate personal, social, civic, and environmental responsibility.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Students will be self-directed learners who are adaptable to change.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Students will demonstrate a positive work ethic.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
