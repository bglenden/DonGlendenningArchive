	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">It’s
	been a good year; started right on time and every month was on
	schedule; and next year is expected to begin on January 1, at least
	on PEI.

	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">My
	health is good, at least as far as I know, however, I plan to go to
	my doctor in January to see what he thinks.

	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">I
	still plant a garden, go to my woodlot, and</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">do
	a bit of volunteer work.  After a good many years, I have drawn both
	my Family Chronicles and my genealogy to a close.  If any readers
	are interested in Black River information I have, please contact me
	at   <u><a href="mailto:don@glendenning.net">don@glendenning.net</a></u>
	  I am also writing some recollections of my work at Holland
	College.</p>

	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Carol
	keeps on the go.  She enjoys the cottage and her garden in the
	summer.  Come winter, Carol really enjoys her bridge and, according
	to all reports, is very good at it.  Other family members keep well
	also.  Brian and Marie continue to live in Soccoro, NM; Brian’s
	work includes a great deal of travel.  Granddaughter, Laura is
	finishing a Master’s degree at Carnegie Mellon University in
	Pittsburg; Granddaughter, Lisa and husband Kevin live in Seattle
	where Lisa is a student at Washington University.    Janet continues
	to look after the taxpayer’s interests in Ottawa and, as I write,
	she and Mike Spollen are about to be married in St. Lucia.</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">As
	I write, Carol and I are planning a Christmas cruise in the
	Caribbean if all goes well, we plan to visit New Mexico later in the
	spring to see Brian and Marie.  The Mediterranean cruise mentioned
	in last year’s letter was aborted because of the disruption in
	flying to Europe caused by the volcanic eruption in Iceland.</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Earlier
	this morning, I re-read our Christmas cards and notes from 2009. 
	They brought back many happy memories of family and friends over the
	years. I have exchanged Christmas notes with a friend in New Zealand
	since 1956, and I am pleased to say that last week his 2010 note
	arrived; we studied together in London, England in 1955-56 and spent
	3 weeks backpacking in Europe that spring; we haven’t seen each
	other since.</p>
