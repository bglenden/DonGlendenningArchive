<div class="reader-summary">Don&#x27;s contextual chapter for DACUM at 40, tracing vocational training policy from WWI through 1960s federal expansion. Establishes historical background for DACUM&#x27;s emergence as response to skilled worker shortages and education system evolution.</div>

<div class="reader-content">
<p><b>Context</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The actual origin of DACUM can and will be pinpointed with considerable accuracy later in this book.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This chapter, however, attempts to place its origin in the context of the times.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In so doing, the author acknowledges that he was a participant, not in the early development of DACUM, but in the broader general expansion of training at the time.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This chapter attempts to identify some of the activities of the period giving rise to DACUM.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The Second World War saw Canada change from an agrarian to an industrial economy.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The decade of industrial expansion immediately following the War was possible only because of the significant influx of skilled people from Western Europe.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>By the late 1950's, however, it became evident that Canada could no longer depend on this source of supply.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Furthermore, large numbers of Canadians continued to be unemployed while the economy suffered from a shortage of skilled workers.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The Government of Canada has long been interested in vocational training and in 1910 established a Royal Commission on Industrial Training and Technical Education.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Before the Royal Commission had completed its work, however, federal funding was provided under the Agricultural Aid Act of 1912 and was continued under the Agricultural Instruction Act of 1913.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The Royal Commission tabled its report in 1914; however, before the Report could be acted upon, Canada found itself engaged in WW1.at war.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Consideration of, and action on, the report was delayed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The Technical Education Act of 1919 initiated the first broad-based program of federal support for training and federal financial support has continued ever since, except for a brief period in the early 1930's. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Technical and Vocational Training Assistance ACT</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>During the 1960's, technical and vocational training programs exploded in Canada primarily as a result of leadership and massive funding by the federal government.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>New institutes of technology were built in every Province and these, together with trade schools and educational up-grading programs, became the foundation for many of our community colleges.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Programs were initiated and expanded for the training of skilled workers, technicians and technologists, the employed and the unemployed, the disabled, the under-educated, apprentices, and teachers and trainers.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Through a series of federal-provincial agreements funds, were provided for construction and renovation of secondary schools but very little for their operation</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>In additional to a massive program of building, renovating and equipping training facilities, the TVTA Act included maqssive operational support for:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span>The Technical and Vocational High School Program</span> provided a small amount of operational support for<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>courses and programs of regular secondary schools, technical, vocational or composite high schools where the full-time training had a minimum of fifty percent of school time spent in instruction preparing for an occupation.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This included technical, trade or occupational practice and theory, mathematics, science and drawing.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Program also provided financial support for business studies but not for home economics.</p>
<p><span>The Technician Training Program</span> under which the federal government contributed fifty percent of provincial costs of training at the post secondary school level.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Training could include the fields of engineering, science, business or other fields requiring advanced theoretical and practical training but did not include training for university credit.</p>
<p><span>Trade and other Occupational Training Program </span>for people who had left the public school system and were over the age for compulsory school attendance and who (1) wished to upgrade their skills, (2) were about to enter employment or (3)wished to retrain<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>for a change of occupation. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><span>Training in Co-operation with Industry</span> provided<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>financial support for training of people already employed to meet the changing needs of industry as well as improvement of their supervisory or management skills.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Courses were developed jointly by a province and an employer, or group of employers, could be on or off the work site and available on either a full time or part time mode of delivery.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><span>Training for the Unemployed</span> was designed to help unemployed persons improve their basic education, trade, technical or occupational competence.</p>
<p><span>Training of the Disabled Program</span> provided for the technical, vocational or professional training retraining or vocational assessment for any disabled Canadian who, because of a continuing disability, required fitting him or her for employment in a suitable occupation.</p>
<p><span>Training of Technical and Vocational Teachers Program</span> was intended to ensure a supply of trained teachers for programs identified above and included teachers, supervisors and management personal in various institutions as well those responsible in various government departments or industry.</p>
<p><span>Training for Federal Departments and Agencies</span> covered skill training for members of the federal government and armed forces.</p>
<p><span>Student Aid Program</span> provided financial assistance for students in universities or enrolled in nursing programs.</p>
<p><span>Manpower requirements and Training Research Program</span> was added later and intended to stimulate and encourage research projects to support the need for training and for its delivery.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>All provinces and territories participated in the Technical and Vocational Training Assistance Act resulting in the creation of 440,000 new student places comprised of 655 new and expanded secondary schools, 39 institutes of technology and 194 adult training centres.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Emergence of Community Colleges</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>At the trade and technical level, two patterns of institution building emerged.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>One involved institutes of technology and trade schools separate from each other while the other saw trade and technical training housed under the same roof.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>By the mid-sixties, however, there was a general movement to consolidate trade, technical and educational upgrading in a geographic area under a single administration; Ontario created 20 such institutions and called them Colleges of Applied Arts and Technology.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>By 1970, the movement became Canada wide with most of the institutions created under the TVTA Act, except for the secondary schools, becoming known as community colleges.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This was a very creative period in education in Canada and Canada was viewed in many countries as a world leader in the field.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Holland college, whose role in the evolution of DACUM will be described later, emerged at the end of the 1960’s.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>An Activist Federal Training Branch</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>Even though education in Canada is a provincial responsibility, the federal government has played an active and significant role in encouraging and supporting technical and vocational education since the introduction of the Agricultural Instruction Act of 1912.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Financial support, usually at very significant levels, has flowed to Provinces ever since except for a brief break during the depression years in the early 1930’s. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It appears to the author, however, that the 1960’s also brought a level of federal leadership consistent with the level of financial support.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Evidence of the leadership includes the establishment of a National Council on Technical and Vocational Training chaired by Hon. Fred McNally, regular meetings of provincial Directors of Vocational Education and Directors of Apprenticeship, active support for research and experimentation, greatly expanded development of occupational and functional analyses, sponsorship of technical up-dating courses for teachers, support for a national meeting and Association of Technical Institute Administrators, support for the Canadian Vocational Association, publication of a national training journal, travel/study tours for senior administrators, <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Perhaps less recognized but even more important was the deliberate attempt to develop a training culture throughout the country and even to strengthen the Canadian national fabric.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As a person working in the Federal training Branch at the time, there was no doubt in my mind that part of our role was to create a new training dynamic.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Beyond federal and provincial government officials, the active on-site institutional leadership tended to be drawn from many walks of life thus even increasing the sense of energy and achievement.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Occupational and Functional Analyses</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>While occupational analyses were standard tools for planning vocational training programs, analyses tended to be local or provincial initiatives.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>At the first national conference on apprenticeship held in Ottawa in May 1952, the Minister of Labour accepted a recommendation that the Federal and Provincial Governments cooperate in preparing occupational analysis of the machinist trade.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A committee of five persons from BC, under the chairmanship of Harry Jones, was appointed to carry out the task.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The analysis was published by the Queen's Printer in Ottawa in 1956.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Later analyses followed the same format but general support and technical direction was provided to expert committees by officials of the Training Branch of the Department of Labour in Ottawa.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Analyses were national in scope and were prepared primarily for apprenticeable trades and were printed and distributed in both official languages.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The initiative was expanded during the early 1960’s in support of the increasing variety of new training offerings.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>It soon became evident, that while an occupation-by-occupation analysis was necessary, a different perspective was required for efficient manpower planning.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Furthermore, an industry-wide analysis would help to identify common skills as well as duplication and overlap between and among occupations.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The knowledge would also be useful as a basis for cross training or to prepare people who were skilled in one trade to transfer to another.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The response by the Federal training Branch was the development of industry-wide functional analyses.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A functional analysis was</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>"designed to provide a graphical means of communication through which business and industry could identify its total manpower needs in terms of the relationship between functional capability and operational or production objectives, rather than in terms of lengthy, unwieldy and unrelated written descriptions or an abstract listing of occupations or jobs."<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Whereas an occupational analysis included a listing of skills and related knowledge and were produced in soft-covered booklets eight and one-half by eleven inches in size, functional analyses were produced on long sheets of blueprint (or whiteprint) paper perhaps 15 to 20 feet in length and usually displayed on a large table or on a wall.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Functional analyses were complex charts showing the relationship between and among occupations at the "professional, technician, craft and operative" levels. The Bratt report includes a functional analysis of the forestry industry.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>One of the analysts, working in the Technical and Vocational Training Branch during the early 1960's with Gordon Bratt, was R. E. Adams whose name appears on some of the charts in the report by Bratt and whose work in the development of DACUM will be explained in more detail later in this document.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Staffing</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>Obviously the rapid expansion of technical and vocational training noted earlier was dependant upon securing qualified instructional, administrative and support staff.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Most instructional staff were new recruits drawn directly from practising their skills in relevant occupations.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Especially in the beginning, new staff members arrived only a few days ahead of their students; they taught as they were taught some years earlier.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Some Provinces and larger institutions were able to provide in-service training and summer courses.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Once immediate instructional needs were met, most Provinces, and some larger institutions, strengthened their pedagogical offerings and many required formal training in instructional techniques and program development.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The four Atlantic Provinces, for example, established licensing requirements for its instructional staff and provided the training under the Atlantic Provinces Technical and Vocational Teacher Training Agreement.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The Province of New Brunswick already operated a vocational teacher training program which was expanded to provide full-time and summer courses for its technical and vocational teachers in other parts of the Region as well.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Increased numbers of administrative staff were also required and, for the most part, were promoted from within the system; many had military backgrounds and had served as heads of veterans training establishments, many were practising engineers, some came<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>from other branches of the education system.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Curriculum Development</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Provinces responded to the need for staff and curriculum development in their own way; most appeared to leave curriculum development to the institution institutions left curriculum decisi0ns to instructors who relied heavily on the available national occupational analyses and the recent experience of the instructor.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The British Columbia Department of Education had established a Vocational Curriculum Development Branch in 1956 to provide curriculum support for its vocational schools and technical programs and was a pioneer in the field.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Thanks to federal funding, the Curriculum Division was both expanded and upgraded and was probably the most active centralized curriculum development operation in the country.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As the reader will find later in this book, the Director of the Curriculum Division, Howard Clement, became a key player in the development of DACUM.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Training Standards</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>While education standards are a concern to the general public, training standards have an additional player, the employing community also being served.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The concern came especially into focus with the creation of 40 institutions of technology across the country.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Should these new institutions adopt a standard diploma or should each institution go on its own?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Standards became the subject of much discussion, especially among members of the Canadian Association of Technical Administrators, CATA*<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>CVA Journal, Vol 14, No. 2 p7. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The outcome was agreement across the country that a students entering a program leading to a Diploma of Technology or a Diploma of Applied Arts would be high school graduates with high school leaving credits<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>in Mathematics, science and either French or English.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The following program requirements were also agreed upon:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Minimum of 2400 hours of instruction</p>
<p>Content:</p>
<p>Related general education – 			10-15 %</p>
<p>Auxiliary and supporting technical courses – 	15 -20 %</p>
<p>Mathematics and basic sciences – 			10 -30 %</p>
<p>Technical specialty – 				35 -40%</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>While the writer found these criteria among his notes he cannot find the original source.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Canadian Vocational Association</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The Canadian Vocational Association was incorporated in 1960 and coincided its establishment coincided with the enactment of the federal Technical and Vocational Training Assistance Act.<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>As one would expect, federal, provincial and municipal officials responsible for implementing vocational programs met frequently to plan and discuss the implementation of the emerging programs; federal-provincial network soon developed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The same officials also found themselves at national educational conferences and even caucusing over at a Canadian breakfast at the American Vocational Association.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Later, these officials decided to found the Canadian Vocational Association.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Initial meetings were usually held in Ottawa as an add-on to federal-provincial gatherings but by the mid-nineteen sixties, the Association had launched national meetings and conferences in its own right. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Members of the Association came from all levels of education, secondary, post secondary and private institutions; they were teachers, guidance counselors, trustees, government officials, university professors; the were employed by federal, provincial or municipal governments, educational associations or in private industry; every province and other countries were represented at national conferences as well as any subject that you could imagine.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>As at any conference, while inspiration may have come from speakers, real learning came during the exchanges while drinking coffee during break, late night sessions in a colleagues room, during a banquet or dance or listening to an exchange between officials from federal and provincial governments and/or private industry<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
