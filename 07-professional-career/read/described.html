<p><b>FOREWORD</b><b></b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Competency based education and training has moved from the concept to the implementation stage. Many schools, colleges, business and industry training departments are using or have adopted competency based training techniques.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>One approach being used to deliver competency based training is the DACUM model. This model is not new; its initial development began in the mid 60's. What is new is the move away from traditional education to competency or outcomes based education. The DACUM model is being adopted by training institutions and industrial training departments on a world wide basis.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The need for information on how the DACUM model works is acute. This re-presentation of the DACUM model may be timely and will provide educators and trainers with information on developing and implementing a competency based education system.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>As one who has worked with the DACUM model at Holland College and elsewhere for 25 years, it is a privilege to recommend the reading of this booklet.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It should assist educators and trainers in the development and delivery of competency based training and education.</p>

<p><span></span><b>INTRODUCTION</b><b></b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>This book is about DACUM.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is intended to be a short description of the DACUM approach to organizing and delivering training.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The book is based on the model developed by Nova Scotia NewStart Corporation in Yarmouth, Nova Scotia during the late 1960's. During the same time period, a different model of DACUM was developed and implemented in British Columbia; however, the approach developed by the Nova Scotia NewStart appears to be the one most widely followed.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The idea of writing a book or booklet about DACUM has been suggested many times.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In this regard, the first initiative by the writer was DACUM ROOTS which traced the origins of the DACUM concept.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A decision to write this book arises from numerous conversations and requests for information, not about the origins, but about the concept itself.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A short description of the model appears timely.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In addition, the final report from Nova Scotia NewStart Corporation is no longer in print.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Full credit for the DACUM model described in this book goes to Robert Adams and the Nova Scotia NewStart Corporation, Yarmouth, Nova Scotia.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The writer has tried to be faithful to the model in the pages which follow.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Readers are encouraged, however, to read the original report if a copy can be found. Nevertheless, the writer is aware of modifications which have been made, but a description of any modifications is not part of this book.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The writer, as Founding President of Holland College, first became aware of the DACUM model in 1969. Starting in 1970, Holland College was the first institution to adopt and implement the DACUM model for all its full time programs and many of its part time programs.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>To the writer's knowledge, it is still the only educational institution to implement the entire model.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The writer is indebted to many people who encouraged him to write and who provided information.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Many were thanked in DACUM ROOTS.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>For assistance in preparing this volume, I am indebted to Robert Adams for review and comments, Barbara Reid for general assistance and quality control, and Deborah Lavers for cover design and graphics.</p>

<p><span></span><b>DACUM ROOTS</b><b></b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>This chapter provides some brief background information on the circumstances surrounding the development of the DACUM model. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>POST-WAR DEVELOPMENTS</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Canada moved from an agrarian to an industrial society during and immediately following World War Two.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The initial supply of highly skilled industrial workers immigrated to Canada from Western Europe immediately following the War.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A decade or so later this source began to dry up and, while Canada’s unemployment rate continued at a high level, jobs for skilled workers were going unfilled.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Canada's ability to maintain its place in the international marketplace was being threatened. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>In response to these circumstances, during the 1960's, the Government of Canada , in cooperation with the Provinces, launched a massive program aimed at improving the<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>skill level of the current labour force and increasing the number of skilled people entering it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>While this initiative included financial support for a wide range of traditional and emerging occupations. Canada also moved innovatively into the implementation of training at the technician and technologist level.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The latter was an entirely new initiative for Canada in training to meet labour market needs.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>As part of its support for training, the Government of Canada undertook a number of national trade and occupational analyses.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Initially these were undertaken only for designated (apprenticeship) trades.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The scope was later expanded.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Each analysis identified the kind and levels of skills and knowledge required in an occupation.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The preparation of analyses was led by federal officials working with a committee of knowledgeable people from each occupation under study.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The need for and value of these analyses became evident during the expansion of training in the 1960's.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>During the 1960's as well, Canadian trainers and educators were experimenting with setting instructional objectives,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>programmed learning, modular instruction, multimedia presentations, correspondence courses, student learning contracts, etc.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>All of these initiatives coincided with and were a part of the evolution in Canada of what is now called competency based education and its newest manifestation, outcomes or results based education.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Competency based education (CBE) may be thought of a systematic approach to the development and delivery of training and education which commences with an identification of what the learner is expected to be able to do at the end of a course or program.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>From a curriculum development perspective, CBE focuses on the application of knowledge rather than its acquisition.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>CBE takes into account the skills, knowledge and attitudes inherent in a competency and assesses the level of achievement through a demonstration of performance.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>CANADA NEWSTART CORPORATIONS</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>During the early 1960's officials of the Federal Training Branch and the Provincial Directors of Vocational Education discussed the need for research into ways of improving the organization and delivery of training programs.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This idea, however, was soon over taken by another Federal initiative, namely, the development of an economic assistance program for areas of Canada experiencing high unemployment and slow economic growth.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>By 1965, it became clear that economic development activities must include a large measure of technical and vocational training.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The idea took root and, subsequently, an Experimental Projects Branch (later named the Social and Human Analysis Branch) was created within the Department of Manpower and Immigration (later relocated to the Department of Regional Economic Expansion) to carry out a number of demonstration projects. Projects were to be experimental in nature with one project being located in each Province as part of a focus throughout Canada on rural development.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Projects would be carried out by "NewStart Corporations" with each one being given considerable freedom in the selection of both clientele and the focus of its research.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>FIRST DACUM CHART</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>As far as the writer can determine, the first DACUM chart was developed in January, 1968 in Ottawa, Canada.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>On that date, Howard Clement, a staff officer with the Department of Manpower and Immigration, convened a meeting in Ottawa of Dr. Oliver Rice who represented the General Learning Corporation which was operating the Job Corps program at Clinton, Iowa, Derek Franklin<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>of the Division of Vocational and Technical Curriculum Development in BC and a number of chef instructors to prepare a curriculum chart for the field of cooking.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>This workshop resulted in a single sheet presentation of curriculum units<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>in the sequence in which they would be taught.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This differed from the approach to curriculum development observed in Clinton, Iowa.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In Clinton, a teacher and student sat together and plotted her course sequence.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>At this time, individual NewStart Corporations were coming on stream.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>While Corporations operated within an overall framework, each had considerable latitude to design and implement approaches and programs to serve locally identified clientele.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The Experimental Projects Branch played the role of facilitator and coordinator but did not direct or manage the separate projects. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Not surprisingly, events surrounding the actual conception and birth of the acronym, DACUM, are less than crystal clear.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Whereas, individuals close to the project remember discussions in which they were involved, they may not have been aware of other discussions during which they were not present.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The term, DACUM, appears to have been coined at a meeting of representatives from the various NewStart Corporations.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In any case, "Designing a Curriculum" emerged as the name used in Federal documents (and in British Columbia) and "Developing a Curriculum" becoming the operational term used at Nova Scotia NewStart Corporation in Yarmouth.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>NOVA SCOTIA NEWSTART CORPORATION</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Robert Adams, an occupational analyst with the Training Branch of the Department of Labour (and later the Department of Manpower and Immigration) in Ottawa became Director of Occupational Training at Nova Scotia NewStart Corporation in Yarmouth, Nova Scotia.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In this capacity, he participated in NewStart meetings including the one in which the name was discussed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>On his return to Nova Scotia from the meeting which gave birth to DACUM, Adams set about making occupational analyses and presenting them in a single sheet format. The foundation of the DACUM approach developed by Adams and implemented at Nova Scotia NewStart was a single sheet task analysis of an occupation with the tasks being identified by people from the appropriate occupation or field.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Adams acted as a facilitator. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>While Adams continued to operate under the DACUM name, the model which he developed is much more than a curriculum development model. The approach developed by Adams is described in more detail later in this paper.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Given Adams' experience in trade and occupational analysis as well as functional analysis, it was logical that he started the process with an occupational analysis.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He used practitioners from the field; teachers were excluded from the process.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The analysis was presented on a single sheet, sometimes with several panels. The competencies were loosely arranged on a single sheet according to the sequence of skills which a worker would likely encounter in the workplace.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In addition, Adams added a performance-based rating scale and presented the chart and rating scale as a tool for managing learners and the learning process as well as curriculum development.</p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>Adams (pp.1-20) made some observations on the circumstances, problems or weaknesses in occupational training during the period in which DACUM was developed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>His observations were not the result of an exhaustive study but rather reflected commonly held views of the day.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>These, according to Adams, typified problems which the DACUM system was designed to overcome.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b><i>A 	Lack of Programs</i></b><b><i></i></b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Adams was struck by the lack of occupational training especially for the disadvantaged adult.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The training available left many gaps. He attributed these gaps to actual or perceived jurisdictional gaps as between high schools, trade schools, apprenticeship and others training providers.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He also noted the gaps arising because not enough trained people were required in some occupations with the resulting inability for institutions to gear up and provide training. As well, there were gaps due to our geography whereby most training was only available in larger metropolitan areas.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>A second cause of gaps results from the "cult of efficient training", the urge to over design training in ways that, at the time, were perceived to be highly efficient.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Frequently training was not provided because the number of trainees involved would result in high per trainee costs.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>On the other hand, some training programs were often starved in the name of efficiency.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Furthermore, the developmental tasks of a training program may seem outrageous for a small number of potential trainees.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b><i>B	Weaknesses in Current Programs</i></b><b><i></i></b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Adams viewed occupational training as being under a number of significant pressures which do not apply to mainstream training.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>These include the pressures to conform to traditional views and approaches to learning, the emphasis on rigid curriculum organization and sequencing of what is to be taught, the emphasis on group-based learning, the emphasis on the acquisition of information rather than its application, the focus of evaluation on the acquisition of information and concepts, the escalation of course and program entry requirements, the lack of measures of behaviour change, and the inhibiting of self direction of individual learners.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Adams also emphasizes that DACUM based program planning and development greatly reduces the amount of time required to mount a new program.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It also allows learners with prior relevant experience, and who are self directed, to achieve competence in shorter periods of time.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b><i>C	Handicaps for the Disadvantaged</i></b><b><i></i></b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The focus of Nova Scotia NewStart Corporation was on training for the disadvantaged and Adams identified some specific weakness in existing programming which would affect the chances of success of disadvantaged adults.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>These include the "unrealistic level of stated entrance requirements in the form of prerequisite learning and achievement", the frustration of having curriculum stated in terms of subject matter rather than in terms of readily understood and meaningful occupational tasks, lack of short term goals as part of the training process, lack of prior success in school, experience as a "passenger “in learning, lack of successful experience in self-direction, inability to relate schooling to real-life situations, poor motivation and resentment or rebellion against authorities and structures.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>WHAT IS DACUM ?</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>In the final report on DACUM-based training at the Nova Scotia NewStart Corporation, Adams defined DACUM as follows: (Adams p.24)</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>"DACUM can be defined as a single-sheet skill profile that serves as both a curriculum plan and an evaluation instrument for occupational training programs.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>It is graphic in nature, presenting definitions of the skills of an entire occupation on this single sheet of paper.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This discourages treatment of any element of the occupation in isolation.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Stated differently, it promotes treatment of any element as part of a larger whole.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>It is an analysis of an occupation rather than a curriculum evolving from an analysis. The occupation is sub-divided into General Areas of competence.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Each is then analyzed to identify each skill it contains.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The result is independent specification of each of the skills (behaviours) that collectively enable an individual to perform competently in the occupation.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>These skills are defined quite simply and are structured independently in small blocks on the chart.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Each can serve as an independent goal for learning achievement.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>A DACUM chart contains a rating scale that accommodates evaluations of skill development achievement for each of the defined skills or behaviours.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The chart also serves as a record keeping system, as all ratings of skills are recorded directly on a copy of the DACUM chart maintained for each trainee."</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>He further identified the characteristics of DACUM as (Adams p. 259):</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>1.	Immediate feedback of results to the trainee.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>2.	Immediate analysis of program strengths and weaknesses.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>3.	Positive communication between instructor and trainee.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>4.	Self-evaluation by the learner.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>5.	Self-planning and goal setting.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>6.	An interesting, efficient, and practical, yet unstructured learning environment.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>7.	Onus for evaluation and qualification on the trainee.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>8.	Positive relationship between training evaluation and the type of evaluation normally made by employers.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>9.	Cumulative approach to achievement (the DACUM process will not allow negative or downward evaluation unless the trainee and instructor agree that a previous evaluation was in error.)<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>10.	An entry measure which takes into consideration the trainee's previous training and experience and allows him to proceed from his own appropriate point of departure.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>It is unfortunate that many DACUM practitioners have limited themselves to only that part of the model which uses a brainstorming technique to identify competencies.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But even for this, it is a valuable and versatile tool.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The full model developed at Nova Scotia NewStart, however, is much more than that and, in its full implementation, has great potential.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span></span><b>THE DACUM CHART</b><b></b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Providers of occupational training have always used a form of occupational analysis.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In the early days of "manual training", it was based on the Russian or Swedish system.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When the writer studied to become an industrial arts teacher, Fryklund, Ericson and Friesen were the common references for analysis and curriculum development.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Mager's work on instructional objectives was a later influential development.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This was followed, at least in Canada, by occupational analyses prepared under the direction of the Technical and Vocational Training Branch and used by Provinces as a basis for program planning and development. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>At Nova Scotia NewStart Corporation, the training process began with an analysis.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The result was a DACUM chart which is the foundation document of the model wherever it is followed today. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>"The accurate preparation of a DACUM chart is the most important aspect of developing the program.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As with most programs utilizing behavioural objectives, the accurate specification of these objectives is critical." (Adams p. 43)</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The validity of the DACUM analysis process is based on the view that:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Χ	People who work in an occupation or field are best able to identify the skills performed in that field.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Χ	A committee of people from the occupation or field, with the aid of a trained facilitator, can identify most if not all of the required skills in a concentrated period of time.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The DACUM analysis differs from conventional approaches in a number of ways: (Adams pp. 43 - 44)</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>1.	Only observable behaviour is identified.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>2.	Skills are stated within the context of the DACUM rating scale...</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>3.	The analysis is conducted by the industry or other eventual users of the training product, ...</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>4.	... skill definitions encompass more activity than the typical teacher-specified skill definitions.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>5.	The analysis is conducted by means of a dynamic group activity.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>6.	The analysis results in a format that is directly applicable as a curriculum.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>CONCEPT</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The preparation of a DACUM chart involves bringing together 10 - 15 people from an occupation or field and, with the aid of a skilled coordinator, having them identify the skills practiced by people in that field.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As skills are identified, they are printed on cards which were fastened to a wall in horizontal rows.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In this way, an analysis emerges through the efforts and in front of the committee.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The use of cards makes it easy to add, change, remove or rearrange skills during the brainstorming process.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A chart presents the skills in the same words and format as<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>identified by the committee and posted on the wall but in a more manageable size.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>A DACUM chart is a presentation of an analysis.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It displays the tasks or skills of a field or occupation which have been identified during the analysis process.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is not a curriculum but a curriculum can be selected and developed from it.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>COMPONENTS</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The description which follows, deals with the components of a DACUM chart, preparation for making a DACUM chart and the chart-making process.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The objective is to provide an understanding of a DACUM chart;<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>it is not to provide a "how-to manual” in DACUM analysis. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>A DACUM chart may be considered to have four components; general areas of competence, skills or competencies, rating scale, and profiles. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span>General Areas of Competence</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>General Areas of Competence (GAC's) are the major divisions into which skills are organized.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They are logical groupings of the skills in an occupation or field.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Skills may be considered subdivisions of a GAC and GAC's may be considered sub-divisions of an occupation or field.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The number of GAC's will vary from occupation to occupation, however, the number usually ranges from 8 to 12.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Figure 1 shows the relationship between GAC's and skills.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The GAC's are located on the right side of the chart so that a trainee progresses on a skill by skill basis towards the General Areas of Competence.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The rating scale is also located to the right.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span>Skills or Competencies</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>With GAC's completed, individual competencies can be identified.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Cards identifying individual skills form horizontal bands on a wall and each competency can be viewed as a subdivision or component of a GAC.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A facilitator manages the identification process to ensure that the occupation is adequately covered.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As the chart is developed, it will likely become obvious that some skills could fit equally well into other bands.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In the case of a very</p>
<p></p>
<p>small number of skills, the decision on placement may seem to be a rather arbitrary one.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The number of skills in an occupation or field varies from chart to chart, however, a review of many charts suggests an average of from 150 to 200.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span>Rating Scale</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Adams is of the view, which the writer shares, that a rating scale should be an integral component of each DACUM chart.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Because of its significance, however, it is dealt with in a separate chapter.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span>Profiles</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Once a chart is prepared, it is possible and frequently desirable to strike one or more profiles.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A profile involves the identification of certain skills which form a part or subset of an occupation.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A profile may even be an occupational classification in its own right. A profile also notes minimum rating levels. On a chart for the secretarial field, for instance, one could strike a profile of receptionist, clerk typist, or secretary.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A company may strike its own profiles on the chart to clarify its own jobs.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Profiles should only be struck after an analysis has been completed.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>GETTING READY</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Careful groundwork must be undertaken before an actual chart is developed. Preparation activities include:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>1.	<span>Defining the scope of the occupation or field</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The scope of the occupation or field to be analyzed must be carefully considered before selecting a committee or commencing an analysis. Too narrow a scope results in defining only a segment of an occupation; too broad a scope leads to skills being too generalized with the additional danger of important skills being missed.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>2.	<span>Selecting a committee</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>In selecting a committee, a number of considerations should be taken into account: (Adams pp. 47 - 48)</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>	1.	Adequacy of coverage of the major defined categories of a specialty or occupation.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>	2.	The size of the typical firms that utilize the occupation.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>	3.	Adequacy of coverage of concentration of specialization in the field.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>	4.	Minimal committee size.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>In addition to the above considerations for the committee as a whole, individual members should have the following qualifications: (ADAMS pp. 48 - 53)</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>	1.	Competence in the occupation</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>	2.	Full employment in the field</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>	3.	Considered by associates to be alert and forward thinking</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>	4.	Capable of verbalizing the needs and skills of his occupation.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>	5.	Considered by associates to be capable of functioning as a member of a group.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>	6.	Freedom from bias</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>	7.	Confidence</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>	8.	Freedom to devote full time for the required brainstorming session</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>3.	<span>Selecting a coordinator</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Putting a dozen people together in a room, regardless of how competent and committed they are, does not guarantee a quality DACUM chart.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Leadership and a clear understanding of the task are also required.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>An experienced coordinator is a must.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Without trained leadership, skills may be ill-defined, skills may be missed, irrelevant skills may be included, and committee members may become discouraged and drop out before the chart is completed.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The chart facilitator is key to successful chart-making.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Adams (p. 59) suggests the following skills and abilities for a successful coordinator:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>1.	Hand letter quickly and clearly.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>2.	Familiar with a variety of occupations.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>3.	Familiar with curriculum development</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>4.	Able to resolve within himself the "skill-knowledge debate".</p>
<p>5.	Extremely patient</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>6.	Unyielding in applying DACUM principles</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>7.	Able to provide on-the-spot orientation and reorientation to committee members.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>8.	Able to identify when committee members start getting off track.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>9.	Keep the attention of the committee members on the wall.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>10.	Assist committee members in identifying skills</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>11.	Maintain his schedule of progress and activities</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>12.	Maintain a steady work pace.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>13.	Maintain momentum when it is present.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>14.	Encourage and promote brainstorming.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>15.	Maintain a positive approach to skill definition and the task at hand.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>16.	Control the group</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>17.	Control and assist in final clarification of skills.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>18.	Allow (and encourage) the committee to talk out issues on its own.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>19.	Display common sense.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>20.	Encourage acceptance procedures</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>21.	Resolve disagreement among committee members</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>22.	Determine when all skills are covered.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>23.	Terminate sessions with committee members in a favourable manner</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>24.	Disband a committee that is not functioning properly.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>3.<span>	Physical arrangements</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The physical requirements for making a DACUM chart are both simple and flexible.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In essence, they consist of a quiet, well lighted room with a large blank wall, a row of tables and chairs which can be arranged in a straight line facing the blank wall, a supply of 3 x 5 and 5 x 7 inch index cards and felt pens, some adhesive with which to attach cards to the wall, and a supply of coffee or juice.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>BRAINSTORMING PROCESS</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The session begins with a flexible, careful, informal, non-technical orientation to the DACUM approach.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Beyond this, the basic steps in the process are : (Adams p.81)</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span>Establishing General Areas of Competence</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>General Areas of Competence are "merely logical groupings of all the skills in the occupation.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Their selection helps the committee in its later task of identifying skills, organizing them is one fashion, and making certain that none are overlooked.".</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The establishment of the GAC's is a critical step in the analysis process.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It provides the introduction of committee members to the analysis process and sets a framework for individual skill identification.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>GAC's are printed on cards, this time 5 x 7 inches, and are placed on the right hand side of the blank wall in a vertical line.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Individual skills form horizontal lines leading out from each GAC.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Typically General Areas of Competence form around such groupings as administrative skills, use of tools and equipment, use of test equipment, analytical problem solving, and communication, but this is not a deliberate design of the DACUM coordinator.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span>First Band</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The first band for skill identification becomes both a learning exercise for the committee and a real list of skills of the field or occupation.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It may be necessary, and it is important, therefore, for the coordinator to often review the purpose and ground rules of the analysis process.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Cards are placed on the wall from left to right as quickly as they are identified; ordering or arranging is a later step.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is usually advisable to select as the first band one with which the Committee seems comfortable and the coordinator believes will result in a successful experience for the Committee and sets the stage for a successful chart.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span>Additional Bands</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Having completed the first band successfully, the committee now moves on to another band; it is also defined independently.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>While the process is the same, the nature of the skills to be identified may require different action words or even quite a different way of thinking.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The Committee continues its work until all skills in all bands are identified.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>Review</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Following completion of all bands, the Coordinator leads the committee through a brief process of examining the wording of each skill.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This is done in order to "improve the quality of definition of each skill."</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span>Sequencing</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>At this stage skills in each band should be sequenced and the overall chart structured.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The committee is asked to imagine that they are the sole "experts" in this field and have just hired a new, young, untrained employee.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The task is to sequence the skills in a band in the order in which they would teach a new employee and have him or her apply the skills in their daily work.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They are asked to bear in mind that the employee should be put to work on tasks that result in a return on investment to the employer.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The skills which the supervisor would reserve for himself are at one end of the line and the skills which would be assigned to a new employee are at the other end of the line.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>A final scan is made of the entire chart to check the relationship between the location of skills in the separate bands.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It may be necessary to relocate a few cards but there should not be a wholesale reorganization of any band or the chart as a whole.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span>Final Agreement</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Just before the committee breaks, the Coordinator should review the chart in a generalized fashion to solicit agreement that the chart is "a reasonably accurate description of the occupation, that it is comprehensive, and that it is accurately structured."<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>At this time the committee may suggest that bands be relocated.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The final task for the Committee is to suggest a title for the chart.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The name should reflect the field analyzed and the tasks identified.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The names of training courses and programs based on the analysis may well differ from the name of the field.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span></span><b>RATING SCALE</b><b></b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Another unique feature of DACUM is the seven-point performance-based rating scale which is printed on each DACUM chart.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The criteria and levels reflect those of the workplace.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Evaluation is of observable behaviour of the kind that an immediate supervisor would recognize in a work situation.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The evaluation process is simple, clear, easily understood by both employer and employee alike and is directly applicable to trainees preparing to work in an occupation or field.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Traditionally, school evaluation systems relate only to the acquisition of information in a school setting.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>DACUM evaluation is different; it is based in the reality of the real life work situation where application of knowledge, or performance, is the rule.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>DACUM RATING SCALE</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>A DACUM chart identifies competencies or skills and the rating scale includes criteria woven together into a scale which identifies recognizable levels of performance on any skill.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The rating scale is rooted in the reality of the workplace through the establishment of a benchmark - in this case, level 3, which denotes the performance level of a trained and experienced worker.</p>

<p><br></p>
<p>BASIS OF RATING SCALE</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Occupationally-skilled employers or supervisors typically observe and assess performance in a very informal yet hard-nosed way.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This is based on the view that: (Adams p. 198 - 199)</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>1.	Supervisors are able to sense their satisfaction or dissatisfaction with a task being performed. A number of factors may be combined simultaneously, such as speed with which a task is performed, the quality of the work that is visible, and the usefulness of the product being built, yet the good supervisor is able to make judgements about his satisfaction with performance involving a number of such assessment factors.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>2.	Supervisors assess performance by observation, followed by a rather subjective expert decision or judgement. They seldom administer tests, and, in other than in the most simple or repetitive jobs, they seldom have an opportunity to measure performance in terms of production or quality of product.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>3.	The occupationally competent supervisor can tell when a good job is being done while he observes and monitors work.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In other words, he can tell a good job when he sees it.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>4.	The good supervisor typically avoids making judgements about performance on the basis of isolated instances.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He has to be shown that the individual can apply his skills in a variety of situations before that performance is satisfactory.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>5.	While he professes otherwise during curriculum meetings, the good supervisor seldom makes judgements about ability on the basis of employee's knowledge.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Again, he has to be shown that the individual is capable of performing and achieving before he will grant recognition.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>6.	The technically competent supervisor is able to observe and assess mental problem-solving skill performance not observable by those not expert in the occupation.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He can detect whether or not, or how well, an employee is applying design or problem-solving thought process that are not directly observable in action or not directly visible in the end product.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>7.	The occupationally competent supervisor does not need rigid performance criteria to assess adequacy of performance.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Adequacy is exhibited in the speed and quality of application of skill and the results of the work.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>8.	The good supervisor appreciates the fact that most rigid criteria developed for training programs are not really part of the job.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>For example, few executives are concerned about the typing speed of their secretaries.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They know when they are satisfied with the speed of production of a memo, a formal letter, or a project proposal or brief.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They are little concerned about whether the secretary can type at 60 or 80 words a minute.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>9.	Most supervisors readily express their concern about educational-type measurement and entry qualifications.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They recognize that there are some persons who are not able to qualify for entry to the occupation but who perform reasonably well on the job once they are able to gain entry.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They realize, too, that there are persons who more than qualify but who do not seem to be able to produce or fill job requirements. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Finally, they recognize that there are persons who minimally qualify but who become outstanding once in the job environment. "</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The DACUM rating scale is based on the view that most workers are judged on the basis of quality of work, quantity of work which they produce in a given period (time) and amount of supervision required.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>These are the major criteria; a review of the scale will identify others mostly for more experienced workers.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>These criteria are woven into the rating scale shown in Figure 2.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The rating scale is applied to all skills and is interpreted in relation to the occupation or field.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>There are two distinct approaches to assessing performance.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>one is to identify levels of performance on each skill or competency and, later, to make a judgement on the level of achievement on the aggregation of all skills.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The other, and the one adopted in the DACUM model, is to add the already developed standard DACUM rating scale.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This rating scale is applied to each skill.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>RATING LEVELS</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Adams defined the values of each number on the rating scale as follows:<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>(Adam p.28)</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>"The definition with the value of '3' was established first as a baseline for measuring occupational skills.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It describes the minimum performance normally expected in each skill of a minimally qualified person such as a journeyman in one of the skilled trades.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The definition with the value of '0' indicates unsatisfactory performance.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In other words, the individual is unable to perform well enough for pay in a work environment.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It covers the person who has attempted to learn and cannot master the task as well as the person who has had no opportunity to learn.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The definition of the value of '1' is the first level of successful performance.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is characteristic of a trainee who is able to perform the task, but normally cannot achieve it alone.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He may need help in each new assignment and he may often run into problems that require expert assistance.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He would normally be expected to perform only in a work environment where direction and expert assistance are close at hand and constantly available.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The definition of the value of '2' indicates that the individual is fairly capable of functioning independently in performing the task and needs only periodic supervision and assistance.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This individual could be placed in a much larger work environment where a single supervisor would be on hand to respond to periodic needs of many individuals.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The definition of the value of '4' is for those individuals whose performance in terms of speed and quality is better than would be expected at a minimum level of journeyman performance.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The definition with a value of '5' is for excellent performance in the task.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Not only can the individual perform with more than acceptable speed and workmanship, but he has reached a level that enables him to solve unique problems in his work with initiative and adaptability.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This category represents the highest level of technical performance.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The definition with the value of '6' is for the top level of employment in the occupation.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The individual performs exceptionally well and has the ability to lead others in performing the task.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He is undoubtedly the type who would be considered for a supervisory or instructional role in the occupation."</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>RECORDING TRAINEE PROGRESS</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>A trainee's progress is recorded directly on the DACUM chart.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This occurs by entering the rating level directly in the box enclosing the skill.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>An entry rating is enclosed in a diamond; a confirmed rating is enclosed in a circle.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The date of all ratings is also recorded.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>An example of skill ratings is given in Figure 3.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>(Adams p. 33)</p>

<p><br></p>
<p><b>LEARNING MODEL</b><b></b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>DACUM is learner/trainee centered and driven.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is designed to assist trainees to meet their learning objectives whether to upgrade existing skill levels, acquire new skills, obtain or enhance specific skills required for a particular task, to obtain entry into employment or for certification.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The DACUM approach is the first training model known to the writer in which a flowchart has been prepared to show the progression of the trainee through the system.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It provides in very clear and precise terms, the sequence of activities which the learner is likely to encounter.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>A copy of the learning model is included as Figure 5.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The chart should be referred to frequently while reading the paragraphs which follow.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>For convenience the blocks on the chart have been numbered and are used in the sequence of activities described below.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Adams describes the steps as follows: (pp 29)</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>" When he enters a training program, the trainee is oriented to the learning environment, familiarized with equipment, tools, materials, etc., and presented with a copy of the DACUM chart which he....</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>1.	.... reviews with the help of the instructor, to familiarize himself with the terminology used, to clarify what is meant by defined behaviours on the chart, to familiarize himself with the attached rating scale, and to learn to apply the scale to skills he may have and how to record these evaluations.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When the instructor is confident the trainee understands the chart and the rating process, the trainee....</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>3.	.... proceeds to evaluate his prior experience and to define the level of skill he feels he has in any of the skills defined on the chart.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This may be done individually or in a classroom setting.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The instructor may assist the trainee with one or more ratings to ensure that he understands the process.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Once this self-rating is completed, the instructor meets with the trainee and ....</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>2.	.... prepares an entry level profile of the trainee's skill.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He uses the trainee's DACUM sheet and ratings as a starting point for the discussion.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He explores each of the skills and tries to confirm the accuracy of the trainee's ratings by asking him:<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>(a) to describe how he performed the skill;<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>(b) to tell when or where he performed it; (c) to describe the qualifications of the person with whom he worked.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He will also explore some of the categories left blank by the trainee.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The instructor records new ratings (or the same ones) on a master chart for the trainee in his presence.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In some cases the instructor may give <span>higher ratings and in other vases lower ratings.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This process causes the trainee</span> to ....</p>
<p>Figure 5</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>4.	... modify his evaluation as he will now have a better understanding of the occupation which he is seeing defined in this way for the first time.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He will also realize better what the instructor expects of him and what will be expected of him, in terms of performance, when he enters employment.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>During or as a result of this entry rating interview with the instructor, he will ....</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>5.	.... select one of the skills on the DACUM chart as an immediate goal.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It may be a skill he has already performed to a limited degree and wants to improve, on he has observed in others and would like to be able to acquire himself, or one he realizes he has to acquire to enable him to complete a specific project or job.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Perhaps on his own, or perhaps with the help of an instructor, he ....</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>7.	.... attempts to perform the selected tasks.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The instructor will closely ....</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>6.	.... observe performance in tasks the trainee attempts for the first time, and will be able to confirm the accuracy of ....</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>2.	...his initial evaluation of the trainee's entry skill (if any).</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span class="Apple-converted-space">   	</span>If there are apparent in accuracies, he will subsequently revise the entry level ratings given to the trainee.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>This initial attempt at performing a task will normally take place in the presence of the instructor who will discuss with the trainee what is involved in the task, and what equipment, tools, materials, and information may be required.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He may also set up a situation so that the trainee can perform the task.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Following this attempt at performing a task, the trainee ....</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>9.	.... rates his own performance using the rating scale included in the DACUM chart.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If he feels that he has performed to one of the acceptable levels (1-6) on the scale, he records the appropriate rating on his copy of the DACUM And notes the date nearby.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If he is ....</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>13.	.... not satisfied with his own performance (he has not performed to one of the acceptable levels on the scale), he will ....</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>10.	.... again attempt to perform the task (perhaps several times) until he is satisfied, or he may wish to apply additional learning resources to the solution of his problem.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He may ....</p>

<p>or ....</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>14.	.... he may be directed to and review films or other audio-visual resources.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span class="Apple-converted-space">    	</span>If the instructor finds a number of trainees having the same difficulties with the same tasks, he will, on request, organize group activities that will enable the trainee to ....</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>15.	.... observe demonstrations by the instructor or another skilled person, and ....</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>16.	....receive instruction in the form of lectures by the instructor or another expert.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span class="Apple-converted-space">    	</span>If the trainee finds he can now complete the task, after bringing one or more resources to bear on the problem, he rates his own performance as successful (to one of the Levels on the rating scale) and then asks the instructor to confirm the rating.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The instructor meanwhile has been ....</p>

<p><br></p>

<p><br></p>
<p><span class="Apple-converted-space">    	</span>At this point the trainee exits from the program.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>LEARNING MANAGEMENT</b><b></b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Instructors in a DACUM based system operate differently than their colleagues in a more traditional system. They need a different mix of instructional skills. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>TRADITIONAL SKILLS</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Skills which are important in traditional system but which are of less significance in the DACUM system include:<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>(Adams<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>128)</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>(a)	Ability to handle group presentation.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>One of the traditional requirements of an instructor is the ability to present lectures, demonstrations, etc., to groups of learners.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Normally required are a good range of verbal skills and confidence in speaking to a group.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Little group presentation is applied in the DACUM system.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In most situations it is discouraged because most DACUM instruction is intended to be provided on a one-on-one basis or to a very small ad hoc group.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>(b)	Ability to prepare and evaluate tests.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>One would normally be concerned with finding persons with at least potential ability to construct a variety of evaluation instruments.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Often this necessitates a requirement for prior instructor training in a formal program.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Such instruments are not used in the DACUM system.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>(c)	 Ability to organize instruction.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Normally, there is a need to recruit instructors with ability to plan training programs, establish instruction sequence, and schedule and organize presentations.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There is also a concern about the ability to describe these in the form of curriculum outlines and training plans. Such abilities are usually developed through formal instructor training.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Again, these abilities are not required in the DACUM system.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>(d)	Ability to write instructional materials.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Conventional programs, especially those which are information-based, require instructors to prepare a variety of printed instructional materials suitable for delivery to groups of learners.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They must be able to write materials that will either support or fill gaps in available modes of presentation.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Because of the flexibility of the DACUM system, this is not required.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The instructor can draw on a variety of sources of information, hence need not have this kind of technical competence.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>CHARACTERISTICS OF INSTRUCTORS</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Instructional staff will likely be a combination of both new and existing staff.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Many existing staff will have considerable difficulty in "letting go" of the traditional model and the central role played by the teacher.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is not easy, especially if that role has been a successful one.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In selecting instructional staff, one should look for: (Adams pp 127 - 128)</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>(a)	Expertise in the occupation as indicated by extent of ability to cover the chart.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>(b)	Evidence that the applicant is a "veteran" in the occupation.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This is not necessarily related to length of time in the occupation.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Some relatively young persons may be known for their ability to handle a wide range of assignments.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>(c)	Responsibility in the occupation.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In order for the instructor to relate the requirements to new or developing learners, organize useful learning experiences, and assess acceptable performance, there should be some evidence that he was able to handle a responsible position in an industrial environment demanding the application of much the same skills.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>(d)	Capability in directing the work of others.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Because the DACUM learning environment replicates or simulates industrial job conditions, many learning activities should be group or team projects. The instructor should have demonstrated some ability to lead teams in his prior work experience.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>(e)	Imagination in adapting techniques in occupations.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There should be some evidence in his industrial work that he is imaginative in applying the skills or techniques of the occupation to a wide range of tasks.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He will be required to do this in the learning environment while helping learners identify applications for skills they desire to acquire.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Similarly, this expertise will be required in initially identifying learning activities and in simulating and replicating skills, projects, and work in the learning environment.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>(f)	Interest and ability in developing others on the job.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is important that the instructor like to work with people in terms of developing their skills on the job.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>(g)	Ability to assess skill performance.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The instructor would have been in a position in industry where he was required to make on-the-spot assessments of skill performance.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Persons with supervisory experience typically have this ability, as well as persons who have spent considerable time as members or leaders of project teams.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The expert in the occupation who usually works alone might be unsuitable even though he might be theoretically and technically competent. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Adams included the instructor's role as part of the learning and program development models.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It may be useful at this time, therefore, to review the flowchart, Figure 5, and to focus specifically on the role of the instructor.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span></span><b>PROGRAM PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT</b><b></b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Successful individualized and competency based programs takes careful and extensive planning.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>DACUM is no exception.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A summary of the planning process follows.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The approach to program planning and development is described briefly, however, a detailed description of the planning process is included in Adams' report: (Adams pp. 34-37)</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>"To apply the DACUM system effectively, ensure that the Learning-Evaluation Model will work, and ensure that training system needs are met, it is necessary to establish new priorities for developing a program and preparing and organizing resources.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The Program Development Model (1) describes development categories that should be considered and the sequence in which they should be treated.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It should be noted that development occurs as a continuous recycling process and is designed to continue through the life of the program.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The Program Development Model is superimposed over the Learning-Evaluation Model which is shown in dotted lines. Connections are made with essential components of the Learning-Evaluation Model.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>1.	<span>Detect and Explore Need</span> - is the process of establishing need for a training program or for extensive modification of a program.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Assuming this results in a decision to use the DACUM process, the following must be identified: the employing community, the decision makers, potential instructor(s), potential resource persons for specific components of the program.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>2.	<span>Develop DACUM Chart</span> - is the process of committee specification of the skill requirements of the occupation.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>3.	<span>Select and Orient Instructor(s)</span> - can be finalized once the DACUM chart is prepared.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The Chart indicates the scope of skills that must be handled in the program, and from this the skill requirements of prospective instructors can be assessed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Introductory orientation should take place before placing heavy development responsibility on the instructor.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>However, it will continue informally well into the actual operation of the program.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>4.	<span>Define Learning Activities</span> - is the process of assessing each identified skill on the DACUM chart and visualizing appropriate work-oriented activities through which the student can gain experience and through which his achievement can be evaluated.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>5.	<span>Select and Place Trainee</span> - is done in two stages.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>First, the trainee is screened on the basis of his predicted ability to succeed in acquiring each of the skills on the chart, as opposed to assessing his ability on the basis of past learning performance.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Second, he can be placed directly in an on-the-job training environment if adequate resources are available or he can be detained until all the resources are available for an in-centre training program.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>6.	<span>Select Learning Environment</span> - involves assessment of each skill and its associated learning activities to determine availability of learning resources and realistic learning experiences in a number of environments.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It may be decided to locate training for the skill in a work environment because the experience will be more meaningful or the training less expensive.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>On the other hand, it may be safer and more convenient to locate training for the skill in a more controlled learning environment.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In most cases, it is found feasible to conduct part of the training for the skill in each environment.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>7.	<span>Select and Order Equipment, Tools, and Supplies</span> - involves the selection of occupational tools, equipment, supplies, parts, etc.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>These may be available in an on-job-training site but must be obtained for a centralized training program.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>8.	<span>Install Equipment, Tools and Supplies</span> - is the process of organizing or modifying the selected learning environment(s) in preparation for the trainee's first task-oriented experience, ensuring that all resources are organized for his convenience.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>9.	<span>Locate and Assign Human Resources</span> - is the process of ensuring that all components or skills of the chart are adequately covered by available human resources.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This involves assignment of instructors to skills and arrangements to bring in resource persons to handle any skills that cannot be handled by the instructional team.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>10.	<span>Organize Individual Learning Activity Batteries</span> - involves two steps.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>First, an individual package or container is prepared for learning materials for each skill on the DACUM chart.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Second, an assessment is made of each skill and its associated learning activities to determine what supporting knowledge will likely be required.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>11.	<span>Select Printed Materials</span> - is the first step normally taken in developing a Learning Activity Battery.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Materials are selected on the basis of their projected value in terms of facilitating learning.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>No materials are included which are not directly related to the skill identified.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>12.	<span>Develop Printed Materials</span> - is the process of developing printed materials to supplement those that are already available.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>13.	<span>Select AV Materials</span> - involves two separate assessments of requirement.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>One, there may be a need to have visual materials available for those learners who</p>
<p>Figure 6</p>
<p>may have reading deficits or may not be attracted to reading as a method of acquiring information.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Two, specific skills that require extensive procedures, intricate motions, or the acquisition of complex concepts may best be learned from audio-visual materials.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The materials in this category are usually commercially available.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>14.	<span>Develop Audio-Visual Materials</span> - is the development of materials by instructional staff.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>These may be videotaped demonstrations and presentations, tape-slide presentations, or audio tapes accompanied by textbooks or other printed materials.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>15.	<span>Select and install Learning Equipment</span> - involves analysis of Learning Activity Battery resources to determine what equipment and furniture are required and installing this.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The preceding activities are all part of establishing the initial program.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The following activities take place after the first trainees have had an opportunity to cycle through the steps in the Learning-Evaluation Model.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>16.	<span>Assess Lack of Achievement</span> - is the obvious starting point in refining the learning program.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Lack of achievement might be attributed to:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>		(a)	Lack of motivation or specific learning difficulties on the part of individual trainees.</p>
<p>	(b)	Ineffectiveness of resources.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>17.	<span>Evaluate Resources and Materials</span> - will result where lack of achievement is attributed to ineffectiveness of resources.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Resources might be ineffective for a number of reasons:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>(a)	Learning activities may be inappropriate or inefficient.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>		(b)	The learning environment may not be adequate.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>		(c)	Necessary equipment or supplies may not have been made available or may not be appropriately located to facilitate task achievement.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>		(d)	Materials in a Learning Activity Battery may be inadequate or insufficient .<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This will be indicated by learner difficulty or frustration while working with materials.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Materials may need to be added, or removed because they are confusing or inappropriate.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span></span><b>PERSPECTIVES</b><b></b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The earlier chapters of this book describe the DACUM model as developed at Nova Scotia NewStart Corporation.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This, the concluding, chapter is intended to place DACUM in a broader perspective.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>HOLLAND COLLEGE</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Holland College was the first educational institution to adopt and implement the DACUM model in all its regular programs and the College played a major role in disseminating information beyond its doors.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>In 1969 the staff of the newly-established Holland College spent countless hours exploring educational ideas and debating some fundamental educational beliefs.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The result was a statement of beliefs which guided the College in its early years (Figure 7)</p>

<p><br></p>
<p>With these beliefs in mind, although not yet as clearly stated,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>a search was made for a delivery model which would best fit .<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>DACUM was chosen and from 1970 onward all programming was based on that model.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Some modifications were made to the model, however, they are not included as part of the focus of this book.</p>

<p>July 2, 1970	Students in Secretarial Arts became the first to enrol under the DACUM model.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This included the use of the occupational analysis, modular approach to curriculum development, and student assessment and management based on a DACUM chart.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Sept. 2, 1970	All new and returning students enrolled under DACUM model. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>APPLICATIONS OF DACUM</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>DACUM has a number of major components or applications:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Χ	The first, and most widely used, is the analysis process.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>DACUM is a rigorous, relevant, inexpensive and internally consistent approach to identifying competencies in a field or occupation. And it is community based or, in the case of employment oriented training, it is based on a knowledge of the occupation or field as experienced by practitioners. It is readily understood by people in the field because it reflects what they do and is stated in a language that the field understands.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Χ	The rating scale is unique; it identifies achievement in terms of performance.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It includes all the required elements of a good rating scale<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>- competencies, performance criteria, a scale, and benchmarks.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Both criteria and benchmarks are rooted in and recognized by the employment community.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Χ	A<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>DACUM analysis is a tremendous tool for identifying and planning learning resources.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>For each competency, one can identify the kind of human resource expertise required; facilities, equipment and supplies; appropriate learning activities; assessment techniques and strategies; and the best location for learning whether it be a classroom, laboratory, shop or actually in a real work situation.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Χ	DACUM includes a simple yet comprehensive system for a learner to follow and for the management of learners by teachers.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It provides for an assessment of prior learning, a tool for career planning, a basis for learning plans, a place for recording learner progress and achievement, a foundation for certification and a planning tool for lifelong learning.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And it ensures that learners and teachers are "singing from the same hymnbook". <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Χ	A DACUM analysis can also be a basis for sorting learners for the purpose of credentials.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Certification can be for a single competency or for a grouping of competencies.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Sorting may also result in acceptance or rejection for employment, classification for pay or promotion or for acceptance or rejection to other levels of education.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Χ	DACUM is not limited to school use; DACUM has applicability to business and industry even well beyond the training department.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>DACUM can be used as a basis for making decisions about an organization.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Job responsibilities can be easily identified and relationships and overlaps between jobs quickly spotted.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It can be used as a basis for performance review, employment counselling and promotion.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Χ	Finally, DACUM provides a useful tool for planning and executing lifelong learning.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is an on-going record of what one can now do and at what level; it provides a framework to identify gaps between where one now is compared to where one wants to be.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It can become a useful tool for planning and negotiating the selection and purchase of training by and for a learner. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>SPREAD OF DACUM</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Dissemination of information about DACUM in the 1970's occurred from five major sources:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>1.	Nova Scotia NewStart Corporation used the DACUM model for its occupational courses.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Following the completion of the project in 1972, Adams introduced the DACUM approach to a number of organizations in Canada, including Holland College.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He also conducted workshops in the USA.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>2.	The British Columbia Department of Education developed DACUM charts.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They were used primarily as a curriculum development tool and mostly by curriculum developers within the Department.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>3.	Holland College used the complete DACUM model as developed by Adams.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The College's commitment to modular and individualized education caught the attention of the community college sector and resulted in many visitors and requests for college staff to act as resource persons to other institutions.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>4.	Humber College, Toronto, operated a DACUM Exchange through which charts were obtained from developers and distributed for a fee to other interested parties.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>5.	In 1974, staff from the National Centre for Research in Vocational Education at Columbus, Ohio visited Holland College to see the DACUM model in operation.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Since then the Center<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>has actively engaged in both the use and promotion of DACUM in the USA and internationally.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>POINTS OF VIEW</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>By the mid-1980's, DACUM, or at least the analysis component, had wide application throughout Canada and the United States of America.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Since then, its use has become international. Following are some comments by people who are familiar with the DACUM model.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>1.	In 1986, Adrienne Burleigh from New Zealand visited the USA, Canada and a number of other countries and concluded:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>"DACUM has widespread and growing use throughout both Canada and the United States of America. While the application of DACUM demonstrates small local variations, the concepts outlined by Adams have been adhered to and, in all cases, the tenets that underpin the DACUM process are instantly recognizable in all situations."<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>2.	Macklin, in his Masters' thesis at Simon Fraser University, concluded that "... DACUM still stands, unchallenged, as the pioneer curriculum development system for competency-based<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>vocational training".</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>3.	Robert Norton of the National Centre for Research in Vocational Education, Ohio,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>wrote:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>“DACUM or "Developing a Curriculum" is a relatively new and innovative approach to occupational analysis.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It has proven to be a very effective method of quickly determining, at relatively low cost, the tasks that must be performed by persons employed in a given job or occupational area." (p 1)</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>"DACUM is an occupational analysis procedure that has experienced remarkable success in a relatively short period of time in both Canada and the United States.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Because its structure and procedures allow occupational duty and task statements to be identified (1) effectively, (2) quickly, and (3) at a very low cost, DACUM has become closely associated with the movement toward competency-based education(CBE).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In addition, the DACUM process has a number of characteristics and qualities that are greatly needed in CBE if it is to become a practical alternative to traditional vocational education." <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>4.	Donald Glendenning, the Founding President of Holland College wrote in a Canadian Vocational Journal:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>"DACUM is fast becoming a world model for analyzing an occupation.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The result of a DACUM analysis is a descriptive identification of the skills required of a person who works in that occupation. ... DACUM is effective because it takes only two or three days to complete an occupational analysis, it is highly valid because it uses experts/practitioners from the occupation and it is cost-effective because it accomplishes in two or three days what other methods take two weeks to do."</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>5.	Charles Joyner, in Challenge and Opportunity (3), says:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>"The DACUM technique for developing curriculum and the application of competency based education (CBE) methodology are Canadian innovations, now shared with many nations seeking solutions to the continuing challenge of providing education and training opportunities relevant<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>to the needs of society."</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>6.	Norton, Robert E., in an presentation on "DACUM Quality - Effectiveness, Efficiency and Validity", in Orlando, Florida on November 29, 1989 said:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>"DACUM is, compared with the task inventory, more efficient".</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>7.	Capp, Laura L. "Florida College is Sold on DACUM", <span>East Central Communique</span>, Springfield, Illinois: East Central Network for Curriculum Coordination, Vol. 11 Issue 2, 1984</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>"I am proud to sign a competency chart because I am confident that the learner really can perform the occupation skills' That is a typical comment by an instructor using DACUM.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>At Seminole community College in Central Florida the 14 instructors who have experienced DACUM are pleased with the results."</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>8.	Hesse and Nijhof, 1989 say:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>“The quality of DACUM is dependent on the verbal interaction.”</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>9.	Robert Norton, Center on Education and Training for Employment, Ohio,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>writes in “the DACUM connection”:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>In different parts of the world, the DACUM process is being used - as it is in this country - for a wide variety of uses, including curriculum development, review, revision, and articulation; training needs assessments; competency test development; worker performance evaluations; student recruitment, counselling, and record-keeping; training program review; Tech Prep and career program development; and job descriptions and modifications.”</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>10.	Lawrence Coffin <span class="Apple-converted-space"> 							</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>“During the past ten years, the DACUM model of analysis has proven to be a very reliable tool in a variety of applications dealing with HRD issues.”</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>CANADIAN VOCATIONAL ASSOCIATION</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The Canadian Vocational Association, PO Box 3435, Station D, Ottawa, Ontario, K1P 6L4, has been active in promoting of the DACUM model.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The Association offers training to people who wish to become DACUM facilitators.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>People taking the workshop receive a Facilitator’s Manual.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In addition, the Association offers certification to trained facilitators whether or not they take the CVA sponsored training program.</p>
