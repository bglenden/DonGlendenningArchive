  Chtn Press Release
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Post-event press release (January 21, 2014) reporting on the Charlottetown workshop, which attracted 35 participants. The release highlights an emergent theme: courage—both for young people transitioning to work, educators making hard decisions, and community members supporting education. Don is identified as workshop chair, and the release notes plans for similar workshops across the island.</div>

<p><b>Preparedness on the hotseat</b></p>
<p>Courage was an unexpected word in the discussion on education Monday evening in the Stratford Town Hall.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It came up independently at a number of round tables; at one it was used to describe a quality needed by young people as they transition from school to work, at another the word was used to describe community members who take a stand for education, while the third application was to school leaders who have the courage, not only think outside the box, but to act on that thinking.</p>
<p>The workshop, organized by Education 20/20 and chaired by Don Glendenning, first heard a presentation on the findings of a recent survey of over 200 Island youth between the ages of 15 and 25.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The survey, Taking the Pulse of Island Youth, dealt with youth concerns about health, education, employment and social well-being.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The presentation, led by Steve McQuaid, VP of the Community Foundation of Prince Edward Island and Katherine MacDonald, Researcher, provided details about the methodology and results. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The group then turned their attention to one of the findings, the preparedness gap, and how it could be narrowed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Ideas were many and included the need for action not further study, the need to review and perhaps redefine the role of schools, and the declining value of high school diplomas resulting from social promotion. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Similar workshops are planned for other Island communities in the coming weeks.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>People interested in future activities of Education 20/20, or to be placed on the mailing list for the monthly newsletter, should send an email to pei@caneducation2020@.com</p>
