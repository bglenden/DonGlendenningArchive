<p>Thoughts on School Governance</p>
<p><b>Background</b></p>
<p>The Government of Prince Edward Island has decided to change from two English school Boards to one.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I’m of the view that the change by itself will do not thing to improve the education of our choldrenWhile I am sure that there are good reasons for the change but such a change by itself will do little, if anything, to improve the education of our youth.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>On the other hand, making the change provides an opportunity to rethink the delivery model and make some long overdue improvements.</p>
<p>The system of delivery for educational services has remained virtually unchanged for decades.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Yes, schools have grown in size, new subjects have been added, small schools have disappeared, teachers have more formal training and facilities are wonderful.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But, with a few exceptions, the model is still teacher centered, the system allows little opportunity for teacher creativity, we still deliver to groups, defining success in terms of content, fail to integrate take into account learning outside the system or learning which results from independent study, and fails to take advantage of the benefits of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>While I am not an expert on school governance, it is an area of interest and I do have some experience.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In fact, it may interest readers to know that one of reasons why I chose PEI over another college in 1969 resulted, in part, from my view <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>as to how a college should be organized.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I also remember well the discussion among members of the College Planning Committee as to the nature of governance for the proposed college.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The decision was to go with a unicameral Board and the decision, I believe, allow us to concentrate on educational matters rather than in operating a bureaucracy.</p>
<p>As background, let me express some views about education:</p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li3">Education is much broader than schooling.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Actually focused on school system rather than education, \no definitions of education, education system.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>although ostensibly about education, does not include univ, college, adult educ, home based learning.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Limited to public school system.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Still a need for discussion of the education system, other important parts that need to be reviewed also.</li>
  <li class="li3">Learning is an individual matter even though it may take place in a group setting.</li>
  <li class="li3">Delegate to the lowest level possible but hold each person accountable for results. Freedom and accountability</li>
  <li class="li3"></li>
</ul>
<p>Schooling</p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li3">The Department has a major role to play in assuring that every Islander has access to a quality education, but actually running the school system should not be one of them.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The Department instead should exercise leadership, plan, set standards, certify teachers, fund, monitor, set policies</li>
</ul>
<p>Schooling</p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li3">The Department of Education is an organization, headed by the Minister.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is not a partnership.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Taxpayers ay the Minister for his tie, energy and expertise.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The minister has a large number of employees.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Partnership is misleading.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Not defined, I contribute involuntarily to the cost of operation, my children are clients or consumers.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Use of partners obscures accountability<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li3">It is possible to deliver individualize programs – at least much more individualized than we have today</li>
  <li class="li3">Education staff are paid to deliver a quality education to each and every person who walsk in the door.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Employees are paid to provide leadership, only one accountable for performance is pasid emloyees.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This study is about the school system and not resposnicbilities of the home, the chuch or others.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A ploy to shuck responsibility.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Causes confusion with inisters Council<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>elsewhere reference to shared responsibility for student learning;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
</ul>
<p>Renewed vision</p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li3">I searched the internet for duties of teachers, found one such list from spomewhere in USA; found nothing for PEI for either principasl or teachers.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Found responsibilities but that is not the same as duties.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As long as teachers are employees, they should have a list of duties.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Doctors and lawyers do not have a list of duties because they are not employees.</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p>Improved parent involvement</p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li3">; should be improved public involvement all citizens have a vested interestin education; not only do we pay for it but our future and that of our children depend on it</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p>Enhanced instructional practice</p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li3">Clearer outcomes, standards</li>
  <li class="li3">Teacher certification system based on teachinsg competencies</li>
  <li class="li3">Give principals dollars for staff development, embedded learning time for teachers</li>
</ul>
<p>Curriculum development</p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li3">Cannot stop</li>
  <li class="li3">Teachwer s should play a key role</li>
  <li class="li3">Development model needs review</li>
</ul>
<p>Better reporting of student achievement</p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li3">Performance based</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p>Recommendations</p>
<p>Need an entrepreneurial mentality.</p>
<p>; environment nit a study every few years, need to constantly make changes at all levels, teachers need freedom to try new approaches</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Teachers need to incorporate ne approaches into on-going strategies; we shouldn’t need a new acronym, a new set of staff every time we want to strengthen our program</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>We know how to do better, we must find a way to institute it within the system without having to add new staff</p>

                <p><b>Why Are Changes in School Governance Being Recommended?</b></p>
                <p>Most of the past decade’s education reforms were initiated at the state or the school level, bypassing or ignoring the school board and district office. Now reformers are zeroing in on this neglected middle level of governance, hoping that some changes—perhaps a redefinition of the role of school boards, closer teamwork between board and superintendent, or experimentation with new governance structures—will indirectly stimulate improved performance at the school and classroom.</p>
                <p>The latest round of debate about the most effective models for school governance was precipitated by the publication in November 1999 of Governing America’s Schools: Changing the Rules, a report issued by the National Commission on Governing America’s Schools and sponsored by the Education Commission of the States.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
                <p>The commission’s report documents the variety of performance standards by which American schools are being judged. Especially problematic has been the issue of lagging performance among minority students and students in urban areas.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
                <p>Although there is little quantitative evidence that governance structures affect student academic achievement, more people seem willing to experiment with altering those structures in the hope that the changes will stimulate educators and students to perform at a higher level.</p>
                <p>As Kirst and Bulkley (2000) note, "reformers will continue to use governance and organizational changes in an effort to improve the performance of education, even though these mechanisms may offer an indirect and uncertain strategy for improving classroom instruction."<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
                <p><b>Who’s Accountable in the Governance System?</b></p>
                <p>Much of the discussion of governance focuses on the sometimes rocky relationships among teachers, principals, superintendents, and school boards. The implication is that poor school performance won’t be adequately addressed until these groups work together as a team.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
                <p>Some critics blame the system itself and call for systemic change, while others favor workarounds to the current system, such as vouchers, school-choice programs, and privatization. Moreover, states differ so widely in their educational governance structures that it is difficult to prescribe a one-size-fits-all solution. A brief list of modern-day governance interest groups includes mayors, unions, business leaders, politicians, and community leaders, in addition to teachers, principals, superintendents, and school boards (National Commission).</p>
                <p>Superintendents, especially in urban districts, have taken more than their fair share of the blame for the weaknesses in current school governance systems. Firing the superintendent is usually the first step in addressing governance problems, but this response seems only to have contributed to a high turnover rate and "has often hindered efforts to improve schools" (Johnston 2000).</p>
                <p>School boards are the other traditional targets in the school governance blame game. Numerous observers have been critical of school boards and their role in public education, especially the way they interact with school superintendents (Carver 2000, Dawson and Quinn 2000, Edwards 2000, McAdams and Urbanski 1999).</p>
                <p>A report by the Educational Research Service and the New England School Development Council (Goodman and Zimmerman 2000) notes that "too many state laws require or allow boards to engage in the operational detail of a school system," such as hiring staff and adopting textbooks. State laws should limit the board’s role to policymaking, assign day-to-day operations to the superintendent, and, most important, says the report, empower board and superintendent to function as a unified leadership team.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
                <p><b>What Did the ECS Commission Recommend?</b></p>
                <p>Recognizing the political and administrative realities of school governance, the National Commission on Governing America’s Schools recommended, without preference, one of two forms of governance: "(1) a system of publicly authorized, publicly funded and publicly operated schools, based on some of the more promising trends within the prevailing system of public education governance, and (2) a system of publicly authorized, publicly funded and independently operated schools, based on some of the more promising alternatives to the prevailing system of public education governance."<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
                <p>The first recommendation extends current governance structures to include a few experimental strategies; the second recommendation effectively argues for increased privatization of school governance.</p>
                <p>Writing in Education Week, two commission members, Donald R. McAdams and Adam Urbanski (1999), provide different views on the issues raised by the report. McAdams argues that a system of independently operated schools—the second option in the commission’s report—would allow school boards to "govern more and manage less." He believes that if schools were run by "individual nonprofit and for-profit organizations, cooperatives, sole proprietorships, and the like," boards would be free of the need to focus on the details of how schools are run and instead could "set standards, provide resources, and demand results."<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
                <p>Urbanski favors the first option—keeping schools publicly operated and improving current governance structures. He believes decentralized governance structures would allow changes at the classroom level, where "faculty, staff, and parents in each community and at each school would have greater authority and capacity to tailor the teaching and learning methods to meet high standards as well as the unique needs of their students."</p>
                <p><b>What Other School Governance Models Have Been Proposed?</b></p>
                <p>A few economically based strategies for changes in school governance have been proposed since the publication of the commission’s report. Wang and Walberg (1999) recommend a system of governance whereby states and local boards would create basic standards that schools could devise their own ways to meet.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
                <p>Thereafter, the authors say, schools would be free from "operational regulation or close supervision." Schools that failed to meet the standards would have a set of educational "best practices" imposed upon them. Continued failure to meet standards would call for a clean sweep of staff or complete school closure, "in which case… students could be given scholarships to attend nearby public or private schools." Thus, all schools, public or private, would essentially become entrepreneurial enterprises. "Let schools set their own goals, standards, curricula, and character," the authors suggest. "Let competition for students decide which is best."</p>
                <p>A strategy for school governance with a business mold has been made popular in the recent work of John Carver (2000), whose Policy Governance model assigns the school superintendent a role parallel to that of the corporate CEO. Carver says the role of the school board is "to govern the system, rather than run it." He claims that school boards have traditionally micromanaged the educational process, something that would spell doom for any manager in a business setting.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
                <p>A radical redesign of the function of school boards, Carver explains, would include (1) a focus on educational results rather than on the methods by which they were achieved, (2) newly defined relationships with the general public and parents, and (3) a commitment on the part of the board to speak with one voice rather than as a group of individuals with individual agendas.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
                <p>Changing or improving the relationship between the superintendent and school board looms large in almost all proposals for different governance structures. Edwards (2000), a school board member in Illinois for many years, suggests a form of governance that "takes the decision-making power out of the hands of the few (the board) and places it into the hands of many (parents, teachers, administrators, and community members)." Edwards puts the locus of control at the building level. "How absurd," Edwards notes, "to perpetuate a system in which orders are handed down to educators from a board composed of people, who, by and large, are not educators."</p>
                <p><b>Have Any Changes Already Taken Place?</b></p>
                <p>Dawson and Quinn (2000), partners in a leadership development consulting firm, put Carver’s Policy Governance model to the test in several districts in Colorado. In describing the experiences of their clients, the authors report that the school boards were better able to focus on policy issues and that superintendents were better able to carry out the day-to-day operations for which they were responsible.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
                <p>Notable among recent developments in school governance has been the takeover of several districts by outside entities when schools fail to make adequate progress on their own. For a variety of reasons, these takeovers have occurred mostly in urban districts (Anderson and Lewis 1997).</p>
                <p>Kirst and Bulkley (2000) describe the recent mayoral takeovers of several urban districts, including Chicago, Boston, Detroit, and Cleveland. Whether mayors can successfully become educational leaders remains an open question, and the effect of mayoral control on overall school performance will certainly be difficult to document.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
                <p>Cibulka (2000) concludes that "public school educators may help to reshape the institution by their willingness to experiment with new institutional forms, but they are unlikely to preserve the ‘one best system’ as we have known it." He notes that "resistance to change" in old structures "is likely to further weaken the institution’s capacity to achieve its goals, and to maintain its legitimacy and survival."</p>

<p><br></p>
<p>in contrast, there is no clear relationship<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>between autonomy in resource allocation<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p>It is exactly 18 years since I first became a governor at my local primary school. Last month, I stood down after 10 years as chair. Next month, I will attend my last full meeting of the governing body. In that time, I have seen five governments come and go, read more initiatives than I can remember, seen three children through the school, worked with four headteachers and been through as many Ofsted inspections.</p>
<p>The governing body I am leaving behind bears no resemblance to the one I joined in 1992, when the school was cleverly run by a headteacher who had a considerable degree of autonomy (even then) and who conspired to let us know as little as possible about what was really going on.</p>
<p>Governing body meetings sometimes ran late into the night, but went nowhere, as a slow war of attrition was waged between newer governors who wanted information and change, and those who colluded with the head to keep us in our place.</p>
<p>We were one of the first schools to be inspected under the then new Ofsted regime and the result was shocking, but, with hindsight, not surprising. Inspectors shone a bright light into some murky corners and revealed a dysfunctional institution, poorly led, in which many class teachers were floundering and pupils failing.</p>
<p>The head departed, and we rather naively thought our problems were over. They weren't. Over the next six years, the school haemorrhaged parents, teachers and pupils. Our free school meals numbers doubled to over 60%, we slumped to the bottom of the league tables and heads came and went, but the parents and other governors who stuck by the school became empowered. The "big society" has been around a lot longer than some younger politicians realise.</p>
<p>We didn't need or want more freedom, just the terrific headteacher we eventually found. With support from the community and local authority, the school turned around. My belief in the power of parents to effect change in this way is one reason why I, with others, have now set up the Local Schools Network for people who want to support their local schools rather than rush off and start new ones.</p>
<p>In my time as a governor, the context in which schools operate has changed dramatically. It has become fashionable to rubbish the overly bureaucratic, centrally directed initiatives of the Blair/Brown governments, but on balance they were right for schools like ours.</p>
<p>New buildings, extra resources and extended services were rightly matched by a requirement for better teaching and leadership, higher expectations, and more rigour, accountability and transparency. Maybe only those of us who remember the late eighties and early nineties fully appreciate what has been done.</p>
<p>As it happens, on the day I stepped down as chair, Michael Gove abolished the self-evaluation form in favour of letting schools find their own preferred method of self-evaluation. Ours had just been completed, and was on the agenda for that night's meeting, during which one new governor explained how much he had learned from it, even before walking across the school's threshold for the first time.</p>
<p>Of course, even within a centrally prescribed system, a school's self-evaluation is only as good as the head and senior team. The effectiveness with which it is acted on, only as good as the governing body's understanding of roles and responsibilities. Nevertheless, in 2010, many governing bodies can take for granted what we so desperately needed 18 years ago.</p>
<p>I think I can write the script for what will happen in schools where more freedom is given, where light touch or non-existent inspection is required, particularly if a good head or chair of governors is replaced by a less competent one. Reading Stephanie Northen's piece, opposite, only confirms my fears.</p>
<p>Headteachers often want more autonomy, and that is understandable. We would all probably rather do our jobs without someone looking over our shoulders. But the balance between freedom and accountability is a delicate one. Giving heads more freedom, and making them less accountable, is fine if they are good, but could have disastrous consequences for the parents and pupils it is supposed to help if they are not.</p>

<p><b>Alberta's education system offers lesson in competition<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p>TOM FLANAGAN</p>

<p>Alberta public schools (and it pains this Calgarian to say that Edmonton has been in the lead) have created all sorts of special programs.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>When British Prime Minister David Cameron spoke to the Canadian Parliament, he mentioned that Alberta schools routinely rank higher than those of any other English-speaking jurisdiction in international tests of educational competence. The fact is interesting in itself, but the reason behind it is even more interesting – that there is such a high degree of competition in Alberta’s educational sector. Of course, a degree of educational competition exists in other provinces, but Alberta has gone further by combining all forms of competition present in Canada with other<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The first level of competition is that between public and Catholic schools. Alberta has always funded both systems to the same degree, so the competition between them is on a level playing field. Given the prevalence of mixed marriages today, many parents can choose to send their children to either type of school.</p>
<p>Another level of competition is provided by private schools, both religious and secular. Depending on certain factors, private schools can receive either 60 per cent or 70 per cent of the per pupil provincial grant paid to the public and Catholic systems, while recovering the rest of their costs from tuition. This subsidy brings private education within the means of many Alberta families.</p>
<p>Parents deeply committed to some special educational approach can choose private schools that receive no subsidy because they don’t teach the Alberta curriculum, or the option of home schooling. These parents are free to spend extraordinary amounts of money or time on what they perceive to be their children’s future welfare.</p>
<p>And then there are the 13 public charter schools first authorized by Ralph Klein’s government in 1994. These schools are run by the parents who group together to found them. With full public funding, they’re not allowed to charge extra tuition, but they’re free to follow (non-religious) educational approaches that may not exist in the public system.</p>
<p>As these options proliferated, Alberta’s public system fought back. Public trustees don’t want to lose students because that creates immense political headaches over what to do with underpopulated schools. So public schools (and it pains this Calgarian to say that Edmonton has been in the lead) have created all sorts of special programs, sometimes even special schools, for the gifted and the learning disabled, for aspiring athletes and artists, even for girls and boys.</p>
<p>Throw French and bilingual schools into the mix, and there’s an incredible menu from which parents can choose. Students are bused all over town and into the countryside in pursuit of the option they and their parents find to be the best for them. If the neighbourhood public school is still the favourite option, that’s because the public schools have had to improve their offerings under pressure from all these forms of competition.</p>
<p>What has happened in Alberta education can be a model for other social services, such as health care. Look at the big picture. There’s a fully funded public system available to anyone who wants to use it, but there are also other options – some partially supported with public revenue, others completely private. Far from destroying the public sector, competitive pressure has caused it to improve to the point where it’s now among the best in the world.</p>
<p>Those parents willing to invest some of their time and money in education become benefactors to those who prefer to use the public system, because private investments lead indirectly to improvements in the public sector. Our deteriorating health-care system could learn a lot from the example of education in Alberta.</p>

<p>Appendix 2</p>
<p>About School Trustees</p>
<p>The Purpose of the Position of Trustees</p>
<p>The primary purpose of the school trustee is to represent the parents and the needs of the school children in the area the board or district represents. Trustees participate in the discussions and decisions of the school boards. Federal and provincial legislation describe the responsibilities of the school trustee as:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li5">To attend meetings of the school boards and exercise the powers and the duties of a trustee in good faith.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li5">To comply with the requirements of the regulations concerning conflict of interest.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li5">To comply with all the requirements of the School Act, the Regulations and Minister's directives.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore, the trustee is not only a decision-maker, acting in concert with the other trustees on the Board, but is also an agent of the Minister of Education to ensure the School Act, the Regulations and Minister's directives are followed.</p>
<p>Responsibilities of Trustees</p>
<p>Section 49 of the School Act outlines the responsibilities of the school boards. Ultimately, it is up to the school board to ensure fulfilment of its responsibilities. These responsibilities are:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li5">The provision of instruction in an educational program to all those enrolled and eligible.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li5">To provide for the management of staff and its staff development needs.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li5">To provide for and manage facilities and equipment.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li5">To provide transportation for students.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li5">To manage the financial affairs of the school board.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li5">To monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of schools.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li5">To ensure the development and approval of school improvement plans.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li5">To encourage good relations among schools, parents and the community, and to promote awareness of the importance of education.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
</ul>
<p>Section 50 of the School Act outlines areas in which a school board may develop policies. They include providing educational programs and services, the administration and management of staff, facilities and equipment, as well as the financial affairs of the board, the suspension and expulsion of students, student attendance, assessment of students, conducting pilot or local programs, and finally, the management of volunteer services.</p>
<p>Requirements of a Trustee</p>
<p>Trustees:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li5">must be a Canadian citizen,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li5">must be a resident in the school unit for at least six months prior to the election day, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li5">cannot be an employee of any school board or the Department of Education.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
</ul>
<p>French Language School Board trustees must meet one of the following qualifications:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li5">must be the parent of a student receiving French first language instruction on PEI, or<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li5">must be eligible to have a child receive French first-language instruction, or<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li5">must be eligible to have a child receive French first-language instruction, if the candidate had a child.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
</ul>
<p>Nomination</p>
<p>To be nominated as a candidate for school trustee, any 10 or more persons, who also meet the requirements to be a trustee, as stated above, may nominate a candidate for the zone in which the nominator resides. The nomination is made by filing, with the zone returning officer, a nomination paper in the form approved by the Chief Electoral Officer, at any time between the beginning date of the election campaign and 4:00 p.m. on nomination day.</p>
<p>Nomination day will be Friday, the seventeenth day before ordinary polling day. Following nomination day, the Chief Electoral Officer determines the eligibility of candidates. The names of all eligible candidates will be published in provincial newspapers. Details regarding the electoral zones and polling stations will also be published at that time.</p>
<p>Length of Terms</p>
<p>School trustees are elected for a four-year term. Where an election produces fewer than the prescribed number of trustees of a school board, Executive Council shall appoint, from those eligible to be candidates, the additional members necessary to bring the number of trustees to the total. The term of those appointed is also four years or the amount of the term remaining, up to four years.</p>
