  Clarity - A
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Variant version of clarity essay emphasizing that Don offers &quot;a call for clarity rather than proposing my set of definitions.&quot; Discusses how learning complexity, variable learner needs, and multiple life roles (citizen, family member, individual, student, consumer, producer) require clear terminology. Proposes specific benchmarks: by Grade 9, students should have essential skills for democratic participation. Compares provincial approaches and notes PEI&#x27;s failure to specify what &quot;education&quot; means in contemporary context.</div>

<p><b>A CALL FOR CLARITY -A</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>As a frequent participant in conversations about education, I am struck by the absence of definitions and boundaries; communication and understanding may suffer as a result. Conceptual clarity is a must to understand the people we serve, the services we provide, learner needs, product, processes and values especially when the subject carries layers of subjectivity. The Dictionary of Education (Good) defines definition as “the process of determining the definition or meaning of a word, idea or proposition in general and within a given context; the process of assigning meaning enhances both precision and clarity.”</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Education is complex; information plays a key role.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Learners have different interests, experiences, capabilities and needs; they also fill a variety of life roles. Those who teach, or other-wise serve learners, must be very clear in their communication. Conceptual clarity heightens our understanding of key words and concepts; lack of clarity is a significant issue for public education.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It must be addressed directly so that the concept of education won’t become d-luted and potentially ineffective. Lack of clarity may arise form an idea itself, from the person promoting the idea or from the person receiving the idea; Lack of clarity could also signal conflicting ideas and levels of discomfort or disagreement from within the education family group itself and some say<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“clarity” is also related to self confidence.<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Conceptual clarify is also a must in planning and assessing performance. Education has a reputation for generating “educationese”; in fact, one can purchase an education “jargon generator”.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Simply a call for clarity rather than pr OPOSING MY SET OF DEFIBNIYIONS</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>EXAMPLES</p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li4">Department adopted “Education and Lifelong Learning” in title; are both needed??</li>
  <li class="li4">Many references to “helping<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>young in society”; shouldn’t Department serve all Is-landers?</li>
  <li class="li4">Philosophy paper refers to helping young people to “secure a place” in society; How do we design programs to prepare for “a<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>place”?</li>
  <li class="li4">Department refers to its goal as one of “developing and delivering programs” to young; Isn’t it to help people gain skills, knowledge and attitudes needed to thrive in future years?</li>
  <li class="li4">Most literature emanating from Department focuses on school matters; seldom deal with education issues</li>
  <li class="li4">Recent report by World Bank cautioned developing countries for treating “education” and going to school as though they are one and the same. Aren’t we doing that also?</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p>Purpose is key to planning education services and to measuring results; our neighbours<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>say it thus:</p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li4">Alberta is “preparing citizens for tomorrow”</li>
  <li class="li4">New Brunswick is helping citizens gain “attributes needed to be a lifelong learner”</li>
  <li class="li4">Anon “ preparing for life, work and citizenship”.</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p>We need to be able to conduct community surveys to confirm that our content meets community need; we should be able to analysis PISA results to compare with community practices.</p>
