  3 support letter from Rebecca MacPhee@2016-04-30T15;06;23

<div class="reader-summary">Support letter from early childhood educator Rebecca MacPhee endorsing Down to Earth Child Care&#x27;s need for technology funding. Describes how tablets and cameras would enhance outdoor learning documentation, enable child-directed research, support independence, and allow educators to better track developmental progress in natural learning environments.</div>

<div class="reader-content">
<p>Dear Selection Committee:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>As an early childhood educator employed at Down to Earth Child Care, I believe that the centre (staff and children alike) could benefit greatly from increased opportunity to use technology.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>	Outdoor play is a core piece of our philosophy and combining technology with this could only enhance it. Every day the children play outdoors and discover all that it has to offer; including flowers, insects, birds, tree climbing, and so much more. Adding technology to this experience would allow children to document the things that interest them through photos and research areas of interest with the help of educators to produce immediate results and learning about a breadth of topics chosen by children. Currently this cannot happen as promptly or readily as we would like as we do not have many pieces of technology and children can change activities and focus very quickly, particularly outdoors. We are not able to conduct any research outdoors with the children other than taking photos with a camera.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>	Technology can also be used as a tool for accessing songs, books, or videos for the children. The children could choose the thing that they wanted to listen to or watch on their own. This could be used if a child feels they need a break from others, wants to sing, dance, do something new or has an idea they want to explore. This would provide a great opportunity for independence and choice for the children, for example, they would not have to ask an educator to play a certain CD for them.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>	Gaining these tools would allow children to learn the skills to complete a goal or plan they have in mind along with the cognitive skills necessary to gather information and think more deeply about what it is they are doing and want to do next. They will also be able to carry a topic from one day to another as it will remain there for them to return to, unlike something such as a toy which must be cleaned up at the end of the day.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>	Increased technology use would allow educators to more easily and quickly record the activity and interests of the children or help research things with them. This could ensure that aspects of experiences are not delayed, missed or detracted from. Secondly, educators could gain more opportunity to track, record and document the development of each child (something we can never get enough of) by not waiting to take turns to use technology.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Thank you,</p>
<p>Rebecca MacPhee</p>
