  2015 Wrap up
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Comprehensive post-program analysis document authored by Don reflecting on the inaugural 2014 Education Award and proposing improvements for 2015. Don observes that engagement comes more naturally to early childhood centers than other educational levels and recommends considering this in future awards. He notes wide variation in documentation quality and proposes providing feedback to future applicants about the importance of engagement. Recommends expanding the program to include engagement with community organizations like 4H and Junior Achievement. Suggests media strategy improvements and potential expansion to neighboring provinces. Demonstrates Don&#x27;s reflective, continuous improvement approach to leadership.</div>

  <li class="li5"><span> </span>Institutions nominated spread from east to west, Every level of institution is included<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><span> </span>Nominators include staff, parents and the public at large</li>
  <li class="li6">Some were broad based while others focused on a single activity</li>
  <li class="li6">Eleven nominations from across Island representing all levels</li>
  <li class="li6">Most nominations were based on extent to which school met all criteria, however, a few nominations focused on a single event</li>
  <li class="li6">Awardee:<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Kinkora Regional High School 54 Anderson Road, Kinkora, PE<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>C0B 1N0, Tel: 982-887-2424</li>
  <li class="li7">Presentation at Graduation exercises in Kinkora of cheque ($2,500) and award (Wall hanging)<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Observation</b></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li6">Engagement comes more naturally to ECE than other levels of schooling.; should we, can we take that into consideration</li>
  <li class="li6">Documentation varied from a single page to four<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>three-ring binders plus photos<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li6">The literature on engagement identCould we add a category about engagement with other community organizations such as 4H, JA, Can Do, and others. Engagement in curriculum developmen</li>
  <li class="li6">We’ve actually been asked to share our “scoring on categories”; while I do not think we should do that, from an educational perspective, some feedback could be useful. Could we prepare a letter or statement about engagement that would be helpful to applicants next year?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li6">Some proposers asked for<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>a hard copy of documents</li>
  <li class="li6">Our call<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>for nominations came at the same time as we were announcing our website and starting our workshop series thereby leaving the media unsure of what to report.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li6">The award lends itself to several opportunities – announcement, call for nominations, selected<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>school and presentation – and maybe others including a follow-up story on how the award money was actually used..</li>
  <li class="li6">If we had a sponsor, are we ready to offer a similar award in a neighbouring province?</li>
  <li class="li6">An awards program has potential, therefore, we should map out a tentative strategy for branding and expansion – excellence, engagement,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li6">We can now lay out some procedures for handling the paper work, receiving, acknowledging, copying, etc.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>How would we handle 25 nominations.</li>
  <li class="li6">Each committee is an important part of our team and an ambassador for our mission; they give of their time and talent</li>
  <li class="li6">If engagement is as important as we think it is, should we consider including engagement on report cards?</li>
  <li class="li6">Should documents be returned</li>
  <li class="li6">Other areas for 2015</li>
