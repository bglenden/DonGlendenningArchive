  500 If the Learner Hasn
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Don reflects on his teaching journey and the moment when his understanding of the learning-teaching process crystallized. He recalls being a teacher before understanding pedagogy deeply, attributing this partly to his circumstances: small high school background, brief six-month initial training, youth, and one-room schoolhouse experience. Later, through formal study and varied professional experiences, his understanding deepened. Don describes using the provocative statement &quot;If the learner hasn&#x27;t learned, the teacher hasn&#x27;t taught&quot; in teacher education settings, which animated debate. He defends this principle against objections by noting that while learning may occur in groups, it is inherently individual—teachers must succeed with each learner, not groups.</div>

<p><b>If the Learner Hasn’t Learned</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>Unfortunately, at least for my students, I taught for several years before I began to understand the teaching-learning process.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I say this, not in the sense of blaming my professors but rather because of the likely negative impact on my early students caused by my deficiencies.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Perhaps it was because I was a graduate from a small high school, because my initial teacher training was only of six months duration, because I was still not 18 years at the time or even because I was in a none-room school – or most likely because of some combination of the above.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>In any case, my understanding of teaching and learning only jelled yeas after my teaching career was well under way.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Thanks to additional formal study, learning on the job, and a variety of both learning and life experiences, I began to gain a better and deeper insight into the teaching-learning interaction.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>At one point in my career, I was fortunate to play a role in the teaching of teachers both on a full-time and part-time basis it was an experience that I thoroughly enjoyed and will always treasure.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The following statement always brought animated discussion:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><i>If the learner hasn’t learned,</i></p>
<p><i>The teacher hasn’t taught.</i></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I believed the statement then and still believe it now, a fact that tended to sharpen debate.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The role of a teacher is to help others learn; if the learner in question hasn’t learned what he/she was being taught, then it is obvious that the teacher hasn’t taught.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But, my students would counter, surely some of the learners in my class would learn.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My point, however, is that groups do not learn.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Granted individuals may learn in a group-setting but learning is an individual matter.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When you refer to learning, you are referring to specific individuals.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The reason for a learner not learning may reside outside a learner; the learner may not be ready, not be motivated or even have a learning impediment.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Whatever the reason, if a student has not learned a teacher cannot claim to have taught.</p>
