<p><b>Rotary Proposal - Draft 1</b></p>
<p><b>'Building Island Communities'</b></p>
<p><b>1. 	Background and Assumptions<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p>The Community Foundation of PEI <span><i>is committed to improving the quality of life in Prince Edward Island – in all its communities. Based on our activities to date, we<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span></i></span>believes that there are many Islanders living (or have lived) in communities all across the Island who <span><i>have the capacity and are interested in </i></span>leaving<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>a legacy to their community to support a worthy cause or service. However, there is often not a <span><i>broad-based </i></span>'community-owned' method or vehicle available to them to achieve their desire to do this. While it is acknowledged that there are opportunities to make donations or leave legacies to things like the regional hospital, these institutions are not really community-owned anymore as they are managed and funded by the government for the most part. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><span>and the remaining local charitable organizations do not have or are not perceived to have<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>the capacity to handle endowments in perpetuity.</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Over the past year, the Foundation has begun to develop a new approach to assisting Island communities through a fund called the Community Fund. The Community Fund is intended to provide a formal mechanism for Islanders to contribute to the well being of their community through a financial donation or a legacy fund. Having such a fund allows the community to support local services and initiatives (e.g. the high school band, local artists, health support services, etc).</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Our Foundation has already helped the Eastern Kings area set up such a fund, and has begun similar discussions with interested parties in both the Charlottetown and Summerside areas. The Foundation has a vision of establishing a Community Fund in all areas across the Island.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span>(insert a brief description of how the Eastern Kings/Souris Fund works - how it has already helped certain local causes - perhaps attach the Eastern Kings Fund 'handout' as part of appendix)</span><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Note:</b> For purposes of this proposal, a community could be a distinct smaller (Kensington, Tyne Valley, Murray River) or larger (Summerside, Charlottetown, Montague) community, or a distinct geographic area such as Eastern Kings, West Prince, or Borden Carleton. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><b>2. 	Project Goals and Objectives</b></p>
<p>Our Foundation has already helped the Eastern Kings Community set up such a fund, and has begun similar discussions with interested parties in both the Charlottetown and Summerside areas. The Foundation has a vision of establishing a Community Fund in at least 10 Island communities over the next three years (2010-2012).<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span>(need to search/find out what are Rotary's overall goals - would be good to match the descriptive language re our goals, etc with their language)</span> <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Overarching<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Goal:</b></p>
<p>The overarching project goal is to provide Island communities with a community-owned vehicle or mechanism whereby local citizens or patrons can financially contribute to and support the well-being of their community, and to be able to do this in perpetuity if that is their desire. <span><i>With the knowledge that such contributions/funds are professionally managed in erpetuity.</i></span><span class="Apple-converted-space">     </span></p>
<p><b>Specific Objective: <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p>to set up a Community Fund in ten Island communities by 2012.</p>
<p><b>3.	The Target Beneficiaries<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p>The target beneficiaries for this Community Fund initiative would be the ten Island communities; more specifically causes and/or concerns within these communities would be addressed and supported (e.g. youth leadership, needs of certain disadvantaged groups, other areas or causes that are important to a community)<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><span> and given the flexibility to grow or change to reflect future<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>changing community needs</span>.</p>
<p><b>4.	Project Activities and Timelines<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p>The process of establishing such funds will involve a series of developmental steps with each community and will be initially time consuming; hence, there will be staff time and other developmental costs associated with the process.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The key developmental steps with each community will include:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>identifying and engaging 3-4 community citizens to explore the idea of setting up a Community Fund (could involve 3-4 initial meetings).</p>
<p>if citizens are interested - help them establish a more formal 'committee' to oversee the establishment of the fund.</p>
<p>work with this formal 'committee' to:</p>
<p>develop the local 'terms of reference' regarding their Community Fund; e.g. specific purpose of fund, how it will be structured, how people can contribute to it, etc.</p>
<p>develop and 'sign off' on the formal agreement with the Community Foundation of PEI to manage the Community Fund.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>develop a 'matching' fund development structure whereby the community would commit to raising a certain amount of funds annually and this amount would be matched by the Rotary Club of Charlottetown Royalty.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></p>
<p>develop a local strategy to promote the fund within community itself, and to those former community members who may be 'living away' but are still interested in their 'home community'. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>identify causes and/or concerns within the community that the Fund could be used to assist in the future (e.g. youth leadership, disadvantaged groups, other areas or causes that are important to a community but are often overlooked or under-supported).<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>develop a local communication strategy that provides a regular update to the community generally as to how the Fund is doing growth-wise, how it is helping enrich and support local community causes, etc.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>5.	Proposed Time Frame<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p>As noted above, the Community Foundation views this initiative to be a three year endeavor, beginning in 2010 and ending in 2012; the Foundation's goal would be to assist at least three communities establish Community Funds during each year of the project.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><b>6.	Proposed Budget</b></p>
<p>The proposed budget for the Community Fund initiative is presented in two components.</p>
<p>	<b>Project Administration:</b></p>
<p>The Community Foundation is proposing a budget of $11,200 per year, and $33,600 over the three year life of the project. The annual budget is broken down as follows:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Project Leader/Coordinator</p>
<p>48 days @$150 		= $7,200</p>
<p>Travel			= $2,000</p>
<p>Communications 		=<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>$500</p>
<p>Meeting (room, coffee) 	=<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>$500</p>
<p>Brochures/handouts 	=<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>$500</p>
<p>Developing a database 	=<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>$500</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Total:					= $11,200 per year ($33,600 over 3 year life of the project)<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Matching Funds:</b></p>
<p>The Community Foundation is proposing that the Rotary Club of Charlottetown Royalty provide an 		<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>annual 'matching grant' to each Community Fund based on the one of the following options. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><span>(Don - you and I should discuss this and determine which option may be the most attractive to Rotary)</span><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>$1 for each $1 raised</p>
<p>$1 for each $2 raised</p>
<p>$1 for each $3 raised<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>To a maximum of $10,000 for each community</p>
<p>Grant $1,000 for each $5,000 added to endowment.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>At end of 5 years, endowment will carry $1,000 in perpetuity</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span>Total: (depending on which option we go with - need to identify what would be the annualized costs)</span><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><b>7.	Foundation Staff<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p>The Foundation currently employs two staff persons on a part time basis; a General Manager who provides leadership and direction to the work of the Foundation (twenty hours per week), and an Administrative Support person (twelve hours a week). Their resumes are attached to this proposal.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></p>
<p>In order for the Community Foundation to fully undertake this project, additional staff time and resources are required as per the above budget in Section 6 above.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><b>8.	Plan for Measuring Results <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p>The Community Foundation will establish a project review/evaluation plan that will be designed around the following elements:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>identification of key project success indicators (e.g. number of communities engaged, number of Funds established, amount of Fund, etc)</p>
<p>identification of data sources regarding success indicators</p>
<p>collection of data re success indicators</p>
<p>Regularly reporting of results (bi-annually) to Project Sponsor<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
