  Funding-1
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Policy analysis document examining funding and systemic coordination of mathematics education in PEI. Establishes agreement on skill difference attribution through four factors: number of skills learned, nature of skills, student performance levels, and clustering patterns. Documents misalignment between public school outcomes-based curriculum and postsecondary competency-based approaches, arguing for unified framework. Identifies seven systemic conclusions: fragmented instruction delivery, skill-level-clustering differences, outcome-competency misalignment, instruction-grading conflicts, regulatory vs. instructional functions, teacher authorization inconsistencies, and lack of agreed-upon definitions. Addresses educational philosophy gaps (30-year-old, public school only), absent coordination mechanisms, inconsistent assessment criteria, and content description variations. Notes 2019 mathematics curriculum review timeline. Recommends standard definitions, common competency list, and independent achievement level determination body.</div>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">The above statement
by the Council of Ministers of Education Canada (CMEC) highlights a
concern that is shared by many educators, employers, certification
agencies and the community at large.   The matter of transition in
mathematics  has been a topic of informal discussion with a number of
Islanders over the past year with a view to identifying what, if
anything, could/should be done to improve the transition process. The
paragraphs that follow are an attempt to capture some of the views
heard ‘round the table  
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><b>Conclusions;</b></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Based on the
literature and the above noted discussions, the writer concludes
that:</p>
<ol>
	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Math
	instruction on PEI is fragmented in that it provided by a number of
	agencies</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Differences in
	math levels between and among individuals may be attributed to three
	factors: number of skills learned, level of skills learned and
	degree of clustering of skills learned.</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Instruction in
	the public school system is based on curriculum outcomes;
	universities and colleges increasingly are adopting educational
	outcomes and competencies as a basis for instructional programs; it
	would be advantageous for all levels of education on PEI to be using
	the same curriculum framework</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">A potential for
	conflict arises when the body that instructs also “grades” 
	</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Grading
	students is a regulatory function, not an instructional one</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">The large
	number of teachers authorized to grade students signals the
	likelihood of inconsistencies across the system.</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Cooperation
	among providers is hampered by the lack of agreed- upon definitions
	of a number of key terms such as skills, competencies, education
	outcomes and curriculum outcome</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Broadly
	speaking, education lacks an overarching statement of philosophy and
	direction; the existing educational  philosophy is nearly thirty
	years old and covers only public schools 
	</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">There is no
	formal mechanism for coordination across the spectrum of providers</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">The lack of
	consistent assessment criteria across the system is confusing to
	learners.</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">The way content
	is described differs from provider to provider.</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Public school
	mathematics curriculum is due for a “review and re-write” in
	2019 
	</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">The group
	expressed an interest in working together on a pilot project</p></li>
</ol>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">The literature
provides mixed messages about the nature of competencies, outcomes
and skills; it probably does not make any difference which term we
use, however, my reading suggests that it would reduce the confusion
if  both public and postsecondary institutions defined them the same
way and, at the student level, statements be as precise as possible
in stating ”the knowledge, skills and abilities that a learner must
acquire or improve during or by the end of a learning situation”.</p>
