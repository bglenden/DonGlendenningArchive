  Poverty proposal
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">January 2008 proposal exploring poverty alleviation initiatives in Eastern Prince Edward Island. Don&#x27;s research identified multiple intervention opportunities: expanding Breakfast for Learning program (serving 5,500 students at $0.85/day), enhancing school poverty funds for clothing and field trip assistance, supporting isolated high school students living independently, and addressing gaps in Christmas basket distribution systems. Proposes three management approaches: direct grants to existing programs, call for proposals, or community committee implementation. Demonstrates Don&#x27;s fieldwork approach to needs assessment and his interest in identifying gaps between existing services and vulnerable populations.</div>

<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>COMMUNIITY FOUNDATION OF PRINCE EDWARD ISLAND</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Possible Project in Eastern Prince Edward Island</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Background:</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>An anonymous donor has indicated an interest in a project in Eastern PEI for the purpose, loosely defined, as the alleviation of poverty.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In gathering information, I spoke directly with a number of people including teachers, the Breakfast for Learning Coordinator, a former Board member in Souris and several people in the field of social services.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There are many needs and many worthwhile options; the specific initiative depends upon the interests of the donor.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>One can simply fund an upgrade or extension of work already being done or reach out to folk not now being served.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Multi-year funding is recommended especially if the reject is a new initiative.. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Ideas/options</b><b></b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>My enquiries resulted in the following areas of need:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Breakfast for Learning, a national program operated locally by volunteers provides breakfast to about 5500 Islander students at an average cost of 85 cents per student per day; breakfasts usually includes a muffin, toast or bagel along with milk and a piece of fruit or vegetable..<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Organizers would like to increase the number of times that fruit and carrots<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>can be included.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Some schools offer a mid-morning snack instead at an average cost of 55 cents per student per day.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>While intended for those who need, in effect, it is open to any student at any grade level.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Most schools offer the service 5 days a week although a few offer it for<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>two or three days each week only.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A few schools offer a mid-morning snack instead. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Core funding is available from the national organization and is supplemented by local donations of groceries and money.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The program has a half-time paid Provincial coordinator but the project does not receive any Provincial funding (although the Government has indicated an interest in this area). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Additional funding would allow the program to be offered in additional schools or to expand the offerings.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>For example, the project would like to offer fruit or vegetables on a more regular basis.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><b>(Idea:<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Add locally grown fruit and vegetables to the menu)</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>Many, perhaps all, schools also have a “poverty fund” with money provided by the province and supplemented by donations from individuals, companies and service clubs, whereby students in need may be provided with warm clothing, cost of field trips, books, supplies, etc.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Needs are identified and funds controlled by one or two teachers in each school.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>One teacher I know picks up items on sale when doing her own shopping and simply donates them to the cause.</p>
<p>I also was made aware of a number of high school students, sometimes more than one from the same family, who are living alone.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Some support is provided, I believe, from the poverty fund.</p>
<p>The Eastern end of the Island was identified a few times as a place of particular need, either in the Souris family of schools or the community generally. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>A former Board member pointed out gaps in the current system.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>For example, most Christmas baskets are provided to people who are on lists of people served by existing welfare agencies but there are people, known to community activists, who are missed because they are not on anyone’s list.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Management Approaches;</b><b></b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Make a grant to Breakfast for Learning to be used in a specified area such as Souris School district, Eastern School District, Morrell/St. Peters area, Murray River, etc.</p>
<p>Call for proposals and evaluate each proposal on its merit.</p>
<p>Arrange for our Souris Committee, activists in the Souris Area, to develop and implement a plan to fill gaps in current support system</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Notes;</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>CFPEI can deliver assistance into any area of PEI</p>
<p>Assistance in any amount and for any time period will be helpful</p>
<p>A grant to an existing organization to extend or expand their service would be the easiest to administer</p>
<p>A call for proposals or delivery through a CFPEI committee would<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>be the most unique and most likely to deliver the most service at the least cost.</p>
<p>There will be some administrative costs in any deli very model.</p>
