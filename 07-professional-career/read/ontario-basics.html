<p><b>Back to school...back to basics?</b></p>
<p><b>Ontario</b></p>
<p>The new basics for public education: survival skills for</p>
<p>the 21st century</p>
<p>As the new school year begins, parents across Ontario can be condent</p>
<p>in the</p>
<p>knowledge that their children are entering one of the most successful education systems</p>
<p>in the world. Provincial, national, and international test results show that Ontario’s</p>
<p>schools are doing well in teaching students the subjects that we have come to think of as</p>
<p>“the basics”.</p>
<p>While the importance of literacy and numeracy skills is widely recognized, students need</p>
<p>a broader set of skills, not only to master the old ‘basics’, but to ensure that they can</p>
<p>thrive – now and into the future.</p>
<p>People for Education, working with experts from across Canada, has identied</p>
<p>ve</p>
<p>areas</p>
<p>that are foundational to all learning and that encompass the broad skills students need to</p>
<p>be productive, engaged, healthy citizens. Each category has a set of concrete</p>
<p>competencies and skills that are teachable, learnable, and have an impact on students’</p>
<p>long-term success.</p>
<p>What are the new basics?</p>
<p>Health, citizenship, creativity, and social-emotional competencies, and a learning</p>
<p>environment that supports their development: these are the new basics of public</p>
<p>education.</p>
<p>But aren’t these just ‘soft skills’? Why should we care</p>
<p>about them?</p>

<p>There is sometimes a tendency to dismiss things like creativity or social-emotional</p>
<p>competencies as ‘soft skills’ that are not as important as content knowledge in traditional</p>
<p>subjects like math, English, or social studies. However, these so-called ‘soft skills’ are</p>
<p>foundational for content-learning, and they are increasingly recognized as essential for</p>
<p>future success.</p>
<p>Creativity</p>
<p>Employers want employees who are innovative and can think outside the box. Fostering</p>
<p>creativity develops resilience, resourcefulness, and condence,</p>
<p>and is positively linked</p>
<p>to student engagement, achievement, and innovation. Some of the creativity</p>
<p>competencies we have identied</p>
<p>include:</p>
<p>Health</p>
<p>Students who are healthy are ready to learn. Health education provides students with</p>
<p>the skills and competencies they need to make healthy decisions and engage in health</p>
<p>promoting behaviours. Here are some examples of health competencies:</p>
<p>Social-emotional skills</p>
<p>“Students make connections across disciplines and between objects and</p>
<p>ideas.”</p>
<p>“Students seek new resources to answer emerging questions.”</p>
<p>“Students take paths or approaches that are dierent</p>
<p>from their peers or</p>
<p>teachers.”</p>
<p>“Students can assess the risks associated with the health choices they make.”</p>
<p>“Students develop focus, concentration, and perseverance skills and</p>
<p>strategies.”</p>
<p>“Students can recognize emerging mental health issues in themselves and</p>
<p>others.”</p>

<p>Students who are calm and focused, and who can work with others, are better able to</p>
<p>engage in learning. Social-emotional learning develops students’ capacity for selfmanagement,</p>
<p>interpersonal relationships, and decision-making. Social-emotional</p>
<p>learning competencies include:</p>
<p>Citizenship</p>
<p>Strong citizenship skills support student learning across the curriculum. Citizenship</p>
<p>education develops students’ capacity to value dierent</p>
<p>perspectives, builds their sense</p>
<p>of agency, and supports them to become responsible, active citizens. Here are some of</p>
<p>the citizenship competencies:</p>
<p>The learning environment</p>
<p>The physical and social environment of the school, its connections to the community,</p>
<p>and the range of opportunities it provides, are key to the development of the</p>
<p>competencies students need for long-term success. The conditions of a quality learning</p>
<p>environment include:</p>
<p>“Students develop skills to negotiate fairly.”</p>
<p>“Students develop personalized learning strategies to master academic</p>
<p>material.”</p>
<p>“Students build and maintain trust in themselves and others.”</p>
<p>“Students can articulate elements of their own cultural identity and worldview.”</p>
<p>“Students understand power relationships in everyday life, including within</p>
<p>families, at school, and with friends.”</p>
<p>“Students identify a range of techniques used in public discussion to make</p>
<p>points or manipulate opinion.”</p>
<p>“Objectives of learning are clear and shared with students.”</p>
<p>“Interactions across the school are characterized by respect and appreciation</p>
<p>for individual diere</p>
