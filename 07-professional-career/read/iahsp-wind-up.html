  IAHSP Wind-up
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Strategic planning document for IAHSP wind-up (August 5, 2006) as the project approached conclusion on December 31, 2006. Don outlined three key planning questions: financial status projection, beneficial program activities beyond closure, and optimal use of remaining funds. He identified Lise Laneville (DOCH Program Manager), Harry Holman, and John Robinson as key contacts. The document shows Don&#x27;s strategic thinking about project closure and stakeholder management.</div>

<div class="reader-content">
<p><b>IAHSP WIND-UP</b></p>
<p><b>August 5, 2006</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Project ends on December 30, 2006; anticipate substantial unused funds.</p>
<p>Although some IAHSP Committee members have been asking for a wind-up plan, none has come forth for our consideration.</p>
<p>CFPEI has the contract with DOCH and, therefore, should propose/negotiate the windup of the project.</p>
<p>While there were three major donors, DOCH is the only one with which we have a formal contract.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Lise Laneville is the DOCH Program Manager in Ottawa and, I am told, is the person we work with on phase-out.</p>
<p>I think that we should also work with Harry Holmn on behalf of PEI but Bronfman only needs to be informed.</p>
<p>It is time for CFPEI to take the initiative and propose a phase out plan – obviously in consultation with IAHSP</p>
<p>To my way of thinking, there are three questions to be considered:</p>
<p>A	What is our best projection of the program status and financial status on</p>
<p>December 31, 2006</p>
<p>B	What program activities will be of most benefit to participants beyond</p>
<p>December 31, 2006?</p>
<p>	C	How can we best use the remaining dollars to make those things happen?</p>
