<div class="reader-summary">A letter critiquing educators&#x27; neglect of &quot;skill development&quot; in favor of knowledge focus. Don observes that teacher compensation and student grades emphasize knowledge acquisition (lowest level of Bloom&#x27;s taxonomy) rather than ability to apply knowledge. He defines skill development as &quot;an educational process of increasing a person&#x27;s ability to do something&quot; and argues it applies across all programs and subjects. The letter advocates for higher achievement standards and greater precision in educational terminology to increase accountability.</div>

<p>Dear Sir:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>	<b>	 <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b>Skill Development</b></p>
<p>Educators seldom talk about skill development; it seems at odds with their culture.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>An educator’s life seems to revolve around knowledge; teacher pay scales are<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>based on their level of knowledge rather than their skill or complexity of task.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Student grades are based on tests of knowledge, one of the lowest levels of learning.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Published grading requirements re waivd <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>through ”social promotion”.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>No wonder high school diplomas have lost much of their value as a screening device for postsecondary institutions or employment.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>On the other hand, the federal government pay for tithe latest example is that of “skill development”.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It’s almost as though being accurate or precise is not important or too confining or perhaps; a suspicious person may think it is avoided to reduce accountability.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My definition is a simple one; “Skill development is an educational process if increasing a person’s ability to do something.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">      </span>And it is applicable to any program and any subject.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>In my understanding, undertaking a skill development program could include increasing one’s level in public speaking, mathematics, coding, or teaching. It is more than increasing one’s knowledge it is about being able to apply that knowledge to solving additional or more complex problems.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Bloom’s taxonomy lists the lowest level of cognitive learning as knowing</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Skill development programs require a higher level of achievement on common skills than</p>
