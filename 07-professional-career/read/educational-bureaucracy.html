  Educational Bureaucracy
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">A critical analysis of educational bureaucracy, written May 4, 2004. Glendenning catalogs the extensive control systems schools maintain: determining students&#x27; departure times, bus behavior, lunch schedules, subject choices, room assignments, exam timing, and departure times. Teachers face comparable controls. He argues schools operate on obsolete industrial organizational models while other sectors have evolved. The document advocates learner-centered education beginning with educational assessment, permanent educational advisors (like family doctors), and individual learning plans—contrasting this with current group-based instruction assuming same-age students need identical lessons. He criticizes both bureaucratic control and the lack of individual attention in mass education.</div>

<p><b>16 - Bureaucracy</b></p>
<p>-</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>May 4, 2004</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The education system appears to thrive on taking control. For a period of twelve years or more, our young people spend a large chunk of each day and each year in a school system. The system determines the time they leave home, when and where they get on a school bus, how they act while on the bus, where to get off, when they enter the school, where they park their lunch and clothes, what subjects they will study, what rooms they will be in and when, when and where they will eat lunch, which teachers they may have, the text books to be used, when and where exams will be taken, when they may leave the facility and the list goes on.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The system also controls what hours teachers work, where they work, what they can teach, what they are paid, when a teacher must release a student to another student, the teaching-learning model, etc., etc., etc. Not much freedom in the system.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Schools continue to operate on an industrial organizational model; most other organizations have moved beyond that style of operation. The Minister decrees and the system executes. While the system does not literally execute its students, in some ways it demands and reinforces a kind of behaviour not in the best interests of learners and the community they will live in.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Compare, for a moment, a Department of Health and a Department of Education, excluding the actual hospitals and schools, doctors and teachers.</p>

<p>I let the reader draw his or her own conclusions.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>With that kind and level of bureaucracy, what chances does a teacher have of being innovative? Exploring new approaches? And the lowly learner is even more disadvantaged.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p><br></p>
<p>As a rule of thumb, we should not put control of any aspect of our life, including our education, into the hands of another~ we need to take control of our own affairs finances, health, happiness and I would include our education. I believe that this is a good general rule even while recognizing the all of us for some periods, including when we are young, may need to relinquish control for special purposes or periods oftime.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>We often hear, or use, the term learner-centered schools or education. But what does it really mean? Aren't schools now learner centered. After all, schools are there for children and they teach the things that children really need to know. How can schools be more learners centered than that?</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Of course, schools are there for learners and thousands of learners present themselves to schools each day. Teachers are there to direct, teach and help. When you examine how schools operate, however, you will find that most instruction and assistance is to students in groups. There is a basic assumption that students of the same age are at roughly the dame levee and need the same lessons. Instruction is organized mostly around the amount of work to be covered and the teacher's role in delivering that curriculum.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>No two students are at the same stage of development when they enter school, at any time while they are in school or when they graduate. Neither do they absorb or learn the same things at the same rate or to the same depth while they are in school. If this is the case.</p>
<p>Why do we act as though they do?</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>A learner-centered education begins with an assessment of the level of information and skill that the learner now has. The first step is likely to be a visit to a teacher or educational advisor by a parent with child in tow and a discussion about what the parent deems to be a need or a stumbling block. The advisor would make an assessment and confirm or reject the initial concern of the parent. The advisor may uncover some other concerns about the child, which need attention. Based on this diagnosis, a plan of action would be recommended.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>It is unfortunate that we do not have educational advisors. Teachers could fill the role but they are too busy coping with classes of students. The diagnostic step is usually overlooked~ as though it was not necessary or didn't exist. This step might be likened to a visit to your family doctor. So a first and important step is missed and the child enters class. Individual attention is likely not to be provided unless the child becomes a problem - that is, falls significantly behind the remainder ofthe class.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Assuming a successful first year, or at a minimum, not a disastrous one, the learner moves on to the next class. With no educational advisor, the child has lost the only teacher who knows anything about his learning style, needs, accomplishments, etc.</p>
<p>Individual learner files, I am led to believe, hold precious little which really describes an individual learner. In medicine, it is likely that you will have the same family physician for a number of years so that at least one person knows something of your medical<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>history. In education, it seems, as soon as your teacher gets to know you, you are passed to another. Planned discontent whether it has educational benefits or not.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
