<p><b>Learners and learning</b></p>

<p><b>Learners and Learning</b></p>
<p>At birth, we are launched on the road of life; whether the journey is long or short, it is an individual journey, our journey, and is likely to be complex and sometimes rocky.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The good news is that there is help available, help may be in a number of forms, but the pages that follow deal with help in the form of education.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The heart of education is learning;.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Learning is a lifelong process that engages us from birth to death. it is a process of growing, changing and developing. What we’ve learned or not learned, determines to a large degree who we are, and the life style available to us.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Learning is not limited to what we do at school; much of our learning<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>happens outside school.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Some of our most important learning occurs at home, at church, in our communities, through sports, conversations around the kitchen table, from family and friends. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Birth______________________________________________________________Death</p>
<p>Road of Life</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The road of life may be described in many ways; I’ve adopted the Life roles” model developed in 1990 by the State of Oregon it is easy to visualize, simple<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>to understand and easy to explain. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Life roles*<span><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li10">Individual<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li10">Learner<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li10">Producer</li>
  <li class="li10">Citizen</li>
  <li class="li10">Consume<span>r</span></li>
  <li class="li11">Family member</li>
</ul>
<p>*Oregon Educational Act, 1990</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>From the moment of birth to the moment of death, each of us is engaged in one or more of those roles, and usually several simultaneously.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The boundaries are fuzzy, the emphasis changes, success is not easy to define, some roles are crowded, and navigation may not be easy.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>All of us fill some roles; most of us fill all roles.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We do so at different ages and stages and we do so in different emphases and combinations.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>While we may travel the road with friends, most of the important decisions will be made alone – and we must deal with the consequences.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The road is crowded with people of all ages, stages of development and each with their own mix of live roles.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In the same way that life roles impact on our needs for help, so does our stage of development.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The very young are a special case in that they are so dependent on others, especially parents.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Life Stages:</p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li7">Early childhood</li>
  <li class="li7">Childhood</li>
  <li class="li7">Young adult/youth</li>
  <li class="li7">Adult</li>
  <li class="li7">Mature adult<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li7">Senior</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Success, fulfilment and<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>enjoyment on the road of life involves learning many new behaviour and modifying many others. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>So, what is learning? What happens when we learn?</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>In a nutshell, to learn is to change behaviour.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Educators talk about domains of learning but in simple terms learning is about changing attitudes, skills and knowledge.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A change of:<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li5">Attitudes, the affective domain – means that we act in a way that is different from before – perhaps we are more positive,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>more cheerful or<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>better team players.</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li16">Skills – the psychomotor domain- speaks of our ability to perform existing skills better or to perform new skills<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><span> – perhaps learning to play a musical instrument or developing career skills is a good example. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li5">Knowledge – the cognitive domain<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>- addresses the matter of additional or new knowledge</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>As I tried to point out earlier, learners are complex people in that they bring such a range of experiences to each new learning situation.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Learning, therefore, is a very personal experience, a very personal matter.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Each makes our own decision as to what to learn or not learn,; but it should be pointed out that we learn at our pace, in our own style, for our own reasons and, although we may learn in a group setting, learners may or may not be learning the same things.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>How can we tell when someone has learned? It’s easy, at least in theory.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Earlier, we said the learning results in a change of behaviour and behaviour changes can be demonstrated, observed and measured.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We may not always do what we have learned but we can do it if we want to.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>I’m of the view that most people can learn whatever they want to learn; some may learn more quickly than others, some may learn at at a higher level, but all can learn.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>There are number of things, I call them conditions, that usually help us learn.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I’ve listed some below:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Nurturing learning</b>:</p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li19">Early Childhood Development</li>
  <li class="li19">Encountering Opportunity</li>
  <li class="li7">Engaged<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>living</li>
  <li class="li19">An objective or purpose</li>
  <li class="li19">Receiving feedback<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li19">Relating the new to what you already know and can do</li>
  <li class="li19">Recalling and summarizing</li>
  <li class="li19">oing about it in an organized way</li>
  <li class="li19">Practice makes permanent</li>
  <li class="li19">Demonstrating and helping others</li>
  <li class="li19">Using more than one of the senses</li>
  <li class="li19">Full access to relevant information – outcomes</li>
  <li class="li19">Diagnosid/assessment</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Hindrances</b></p>

  <li class="li7">Home</li>
  <li class="li7">Poverty<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>

  <li class="li7">Isolation</li>
  <li class="li7">Lack of Universal skills</li>
  <li class="li7">Poor study habits</li>
  <li class="li7">Lack of confidence in abilities</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p>Our education is the sum total of all that we’ve learned or, perhaps better described as all the learning that has a continuing formative effect on us.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>To be consistent wit my earlier thoughts,Getting an education is about learning the things we should know or want to know to help us function well and enjoy our time in our various life roles.</p>
<p>We have an education whether or not we’ve spent a day in school, college or university.</p>

<p>Education has swirled about me all my life.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>First as a youngster in a one room school across the brook from my home, then as my mother talked about the new high school, the first of its kind in New Brunswick, under construction a few miles away from my home, followed by my own studies in that school.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Mine was a sandwich education, years of interspersed study and work as a teacher, principal, teacher trainer, consultant and administrator. curriculum I’ve been in education all my life.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It has provided my livelihood and a passion.</p>

<p><b>Education</b></p>
<p>Education is a lifelong process of engaging in experiences that have a formative effect on the way we feel, think and act; this effect is usually expressed in terms of a person’s attitudes, skills and knowledge.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Major contributors to one’s education include one’s self, one’s home and extended family, schools and the community at large. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Schools play a unique role in the provision of education in that they are the only provider of educational services allowed to award credentials, the folded paper, so esteemed by our society.</p>
<p>It is widely recognized that education is a key factor in determining one’s quality of life; in the same way, the collective education of our citizens will determine to a significant degree the future of our community and country. Because of this, we are among the world leaders in our investment in ensuring that our citizens, especially our youth, have access to a variety of educational activities and experiences.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Our education system developed over decades and served us well, however, there are significant changes occurring around us that demand some different responses; our education system is unlikely to make the desired changes by itself.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But there is a gap between what Islanders have and what they want in the way of education.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Not only is there a gap, but Islanders want meaningful engagement in bringing about the change. There is no panacea in sight and there is not likely to be one, however, change must be immediate, significant and continuous, but planned. Most comment is focused on changes to the school system, however, the issue is broader than that, it must encompass not only schools, but the broader education including the role of the home and community; any review must also include a variety of issues including expectations, the need for collaboration and engagement, credentials and standards, personal freedom and accountability.</p>
<p>I’ve spent most of my life in education first as a student, then as a teacher and administrator, and now as an interested observer and sometimes commentator. During the past few months I have re-engaged in<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>the field, read widely, exchanged views with parents, educators, employers and students and reflected on the results. In a nutshell, I find a widespread concern about the quality of education available to our citizens, especially by the public school system.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The following concerns stand out:</p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li5">Basic skills, sometimes referred to as universal skills, employability skills or just plain literacy.</li>
  <li class="li5">Bureaucracy that delays and obscures decision-making and accountability</li>
  <li class="li5">Inability or unwillingness to cater to needs of individual learners.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li5">Failure of increased investment to capture benefits.</li>
  <li class="li5">Widening gap between public expectations and actual improvement</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p>The public is experiencing a changing world and an education system that continues to resist it; the updating</p>

<p><br></p>
<p>I’ve wrestled with what I heard and learned from my many conversations and have now concluded that the missing element is concern for the learner; the learner has been replaced with concern about standardized testing, burnout, the place of technology or qualifications of teachers. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The paragraphs that follow begns to address that problem; this one is focused on learners and learning; hopefully, there will be a follow-up learning model and one on the elements of a support system.</p>
