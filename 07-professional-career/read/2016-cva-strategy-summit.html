  2016 CVA Strategy Summit
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">These notes from a 2016 CVA Strategy Summit reflect Don&#x27;s perspective on the association&#x27;s history, current status, and future directions. Don notes the CVA&#x27;s unique individual (not institutional) membership model, broad cross-sector participation, historical government partnership roles, and the 1970 emergence of ACCC which drew administrators toward institutional funding. He observes vocational education&#x27;s shift from content-based to performance-measured definitions and the federal government&#x27;s reduced leverage for change. Don argues the CVA could become a catalyst for educational change, particularly around &quot;transition&quot; from school to employment. Responding to summit questions about high points, current functioning, and future vision, Don emphasizes the value of personal networking and provincial connections developed at annual conferences. He proposes federal-provincial initiatives using &quot;transition&quot; as an organizing concept and questions whether the CVA could help coordinate training initiatives across regions.</div>

<p><b>2016 CVA Strategy Summit</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>CVA</b></p>
<p><b>About CVA:</b></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li4">CVA Is unique in That It has individuel not institutionnel or corporate memberships, and the focus was very much on ways and means of helping people prepare for and maintain income generating employment. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li4">Members are/were from all provinces, all kinds of institutions, all levels,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>employers, schools, colleges, universities and industrial trainers, public and private.</li>
  <li class="li4">In the early days, the federal and provincial governments were more like partners in training the working force ; later it became a buyer-seller relationship; it appears now that the Federal government has simply transferred funds to provinces and influences quality through some consultative arrangement, employer based programs and special NGO arrangements.</li>
  <li class="li4">Advent of ACCC in 1970 drew administrators away from CVA (administrators who controlled funds); focus changed from individuals to institutions and getting a fair share of federal dollars.</li>
  <li class="li4">The Federal government maintained a small core of staff officers (small busniness, industraial training, testing, occupational analysis) ; they were good sources of information about who was doing what and where.</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>About education:</b></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li4">Vocational education can no longer be defined by content;<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It differs from general education by way performance is measured</li>
  <li class="li4">Federal government has lost much of its leverage ito effect change ; CVA could become a catalyst for change.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li4">Transition may turn out to be a useful concept around which to initiate change.</li>
  <li class="li4">Need to spark discussion at another level of debate see my letters</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Summit questions:</b></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li6"><b>What has been a high point experience in the CVA when you felt this association most alive, successful and effective?</b></li>
</ul>
<p><i>For me, the high point was the exchange of information networking which occurred mostly at the annual conference and especially during the informal events. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As a result, I had “friends” in every Province that I could contact about specific matters.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I know that communications has changed dramatically in recent years but personal networking remains important in the change process.</i></p>
<p><i></i><br></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li6"><b>Presently, wihat are the core factors that make the CVA function at its best and without which it would cease to exist?</b></li>
</ul>
<p><i>Not sure what to say; I am retired, out of the loop and what little I do is focused on public education.; I scan the monthly CVA report, log on to the CEA and People for Education websites, and scan the Saturday issues of a half dozen foreign papers. The public school system could benefit from the DACUM process but few people I talk with are familiar with it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I do not feel that the public is well served in terms of the media but have no specific suggestions at the moment. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></i></p>
<p><i></i><br></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li6"><b>Imagine the CVA is 3 years into the future and it is just as you want it to be. What’s happening that makes it vibrant and successful? What has changed? What has stayed the same? And how have you contributed to this future?</b></li>
</ul>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Future/Project ideas/Strategy:</b></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li4">Need to engage the federal government<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li4">CVA adopt « transitions » as an initiative </li>
  <li class="li4">Would Federal government fund a small cadre of people to act as catalysts for change – levls of achievement, assessment, outcomes/competencies, one in each region; aquarterly meeting with Feds</li>
  <li class="li4">You may want to review the CMEC press release of July 8, 2016 as to their priorities or how to pitch proposals – for example, transition appears to be the replacement for « gap between school and work »</li>
  <li class="li4">Education offers few awards and incentives ; offer an award to a school or training program that …</li>
  <li class="li4">Is their potential for service through local initiatives something like offering local groups to organize a workshop on « transition ».<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Would the Federal Government fund ?</li>
</ul>
