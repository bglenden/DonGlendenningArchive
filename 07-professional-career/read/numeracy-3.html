Documents growing support for numeracy instruction based on Conference Board of Canada research showing 45% of Canadian adults have inadequate numeracy skills. Recommends that numeracy be recognized as an intrinsic part of every school subject, similar to literacy.

<b>Background</b></p>
<p lang="en-CA" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">
School
at all levels, it seems  teach math; it is considered a key skill in
all life roles.  The Prince Edward Island Government public-school
math  curriculum guide describes math as  the “study of the science
of  quantity, number and space” and lists goals of its math
offerings as being to “prepare students to solve problems,
communicate and reason mathematically, appreciate the value of
mathematics, make connections between mathematics and its
applications, commit themselves to lifelong learning and become
mathematically literate adults using mathematics to contribute to
society.” Typical math subjects include algebra, calculus,
geometry, measurement, number, permutations, probability, relations
and functions, statistics and trigonometry.</p>

<p lang="en-CA" style="widows: 2; orphans: 2; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
Numeracy,
on the other hand, is also math, sometimes described as the
application of  math ; ‘instead of digging deeper into the formal
and abstract world of mathematics, learning more mathematics, and
become more fluent with mathematics, numeracy fosters the
understanding and application of our mathematical knowledge and 
quantitative sense”.  being numerate has been described as “having
the confidence and skill to use numbers and mathematical approaches
in all aspects of life - at work, in practical everyday activities at
home and beyond, as consumers, in managing our finances, as parents
helping our children learn, as patients making sense of health
information, as citizens understanding the world about us.” .
Numeracy is said to operate especially in life settings,  personal,
community,  and career.</p>

<p lang="en-CA" style="widows: 2; orphans: 2; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
 In
fact, it seems to the writer that public concern about math is really
a concern about the need for math in solving every day problems.; in
other words, about numeracy.</p>

<b>Growing
support</b></p>
<p lang="en-CA" style="widows: 2; orphans: 2; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
The
literature shows growing support for instruction in numeracy; some
teachers teach it directly while others support numeracy through
on-line courses. Most seem to consider numeracy as an additional
offering and not a replacement course.  The National Numeracy
Organization (UK)proposes:</p>
<p lang="en-CA" style="widows: 2; margin-left: 0.5in; orphans: 2; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
1.	Every
teacher become a teacher of numeracy.  That does not mean that every
teacher becomes a maths teacher but that numeracy, just like
literacy- is recognized as an intrinsic part of every subject across
the school curriculum.</p>
<p lang="en-CA" style="widows: 2; margin-left: 0.5in; orphans: 2; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
2.	A
new measure of numeracy proficiency should be introduced for all
young people at the age of 14.  This would establish a national
benchmark for the level of numeracy needed for further study in all
subjects between the ages of 14-19</p>
<p lang="en-CA" style="widows: 2; margin-left: 0.5in; orphans: 2; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
3	An
additional and universally respected qualification in numeracy (or
core maths) is needed alongside GGCSE maths.  Politicians and
curriculum and qualifications regulators must give serious and urgent
consideration and introduction of dual GCSSEs in maths and numeracy</p>

The
Scottish Education Department suggests eight categories of
numeracies: estimation and rounding, number and number processes,
fractions, decimal fractions and percentages; money, time,
measurement, data and analysis, and chance and uncertainty.
Scotland
Education tells us that “Being numerate helps us to function
responsibly in everyday life and contribute effectively to society.
It increases our opportunities within the world of work and
establishes foundations which can be built upon through lifelong
learning. Numeracy is not only a subset of mathematics; it is also a
life skill which permeates and supports all areas of learning,
allowing young people access to the wider curriculum”</p>

Careers
New Zealand suggests that basic numeracy, needed for the workforce,
should include:</p>
<p lang="en-CA" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">
Counting
quantities for a customers, The use of percentages and subtraction
when giving a discount, using division when calculating costs per
head, measuring the area of shapes, calculating fuel consumption and
understanding tables in reports and interpreting graphs.</p>

In
spite of the importance of numeracy, my search of the literature and
call to friends did not result in lists of typical Numeracy skills;
they are arrived at through a survey of skills practiced by citizens,
employers or another identified group. Education 2030 survey
generated a list of some 84 skills under the following heading: (1) 
Estimate and calculate with whole numbers,(2) Use fractions,
decimals, percentages, rations and Rates ( 3) Use spatial reasoning,
(4) Recognize and use patterns and relationships, (5) interpret
statistical information, (6) Manage Personal Finance, (7) Use
Measurement. Until they are publicly identified, responsibility
assigned to a teacher, measured and asssignrf to a teacher, they are
unlikely to be taught .</p>
