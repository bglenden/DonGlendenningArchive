  Teacher Pay
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">(172 words):** Don advocates substantial teacher salary increases while critiquing current pay-grid systems based on training duration and tenure. Statistics Canada data show teacher salaries lag comparable professions. Don argues the grid system reflects what teachers know, not what they do, perpetuating low compensation. He proposes performance-based systems incorporating student numbers served, specialty complexity, responsibility, innovation, and market factors. Teachers should earn merit rewards for strong performance while facing market consequences for weak performance. However, Don notes teachers&#x27; limited autonomy—scripted curricula, prescribed timing, limited creativity—undermines professional status necessary for higher pay. He advocates professional control over working conditions as prerequisite for compensation growth. Denver&#x27;s student-performance-based increment system and student-choice market pressure offer models. Don&#x27;s perspective reveals frustration with education&#x27;s industrial organization preventing teacher professionalization and corresponding compensation growth.</div>

<p><b>12-Teacher Pay</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>If education is as important as we say it is, teachers deserve higher pay, at least, good teachers do. Teachers’ pay should be comparable to that of lawyers, doctors and accountants - perhaps even higher. While job satisfaction, benefits and security are important, salary is a significant factor in attracting and holding top-notch professionals; a pendulum swing towards higher salaries is long over due.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I’ve looked at Statistics Canada data for both PEI and Canada, and find salaries of other professionals to be generally higher than that of teachers.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The exception may be school administrators whose salaries top those of teachers.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The higher salaries for administrators reflects industrial organizational model for schools as compared to the collegial model more prevalent in other professions.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Obviously, when comparing income, one must remember that salaries are impacted by the length of the training period, working conditions, risk, hours worked or people served.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>One must also remember that many other professional groups provide their own working space and relevant support services.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Even taking all these factors into account, however, I believe that teachers’ pay and benefits should be much higher.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Teacher’s salaries are based on a grid that takes into account years of study and years of teaching experience; it is not a practice that I support.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The grid reflects what teachers know; if teachers are to earn what they deserve, their pay must be based on what they do.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Remuneration should reflect the work done not the qualifications of the incumbent.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>While there are a number of approaches to determining job size, any system should take into account the nature and level of preparation required, accountability, complexity of task, and impact of errors.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The teachers’ pay grid focuses on the preparation required for the job.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Freedom and accountability are not considered; maybe that is because teacher’s jobs have little of either. earnings in the private sector reflect an individual's level of effort, entrepreneurship and willingness to take risks<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Collective agreements have removed the latter two factors from consideration. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>To a large degree, decisions as to what is to be taught, when, where, how and for how long are determined for not by teachers.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The system allows little room for creativity and does not reward high performance either in numbers served or level of service.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Given the above, one wonders if teachers can really be called professionals – at least not professionals in the sense that they control much of their individual destinies. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>For teachers to receive the salaries they deserve, they must take control of their working conditions.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They must become true professionals in the sense of doctors, lawyers and others.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Higher pay is one issue under the control of front line teachers. So far, teachers have been satisfied to leave compensation decisions to others; their low salaries reflect that decision.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Teachers are in a comfortable rut. They have reasonable salaries, good working conditions, excellent benefits and their roles are fulfilling. What more could one ask? Or expect? But not all teachers think this way; obviously some would like to earn more. Or else, why do so many teachers run businesses? Or work at other jobs during the summer?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Some would argue that the extras reflect a low level of job satisfaction.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The current low levels of teacher earnings are dictated, to a large degree, by a focus on schooling rather than education. Pay is determined what a teachers know (or knew) and how long they knew it; teacher pay is determined by their placement on a grid with one axis showing years of formal training and the other their years of teaching experience.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Teachers pay will always remain low until they are paid for what they do, that is, what they do with what they know.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>We need to, and can, design a teacher compensation system with a degree or degrees as an entrance requirement, with salary based on some combination of number of students served, challenge of the specialty, days worked, degree of responsibility, risk, the market place, innovation and working conditions. Such a system will reward deserving teachers but, more important, reinvigorate the education system. Teachers who perform well deserve high salaries; those who do not deserve to feel the impact of the market place.</p>
<p>Most teachers will choose the former.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Beginning teachers should all start at the same salary. Early in their career, however, I would expect salaries to begin to reflect the normal conditions of a professional work place; some teachers will rapidly move up the scale, some may move with the scale and some will move out. That's the way the cookie crumbles.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Denver is introducing a system of that provides increments based on improved student performance.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Allow more choice by students -let teachers feel the impact of those choices. Better than all the merit and evaluation systems we could design</p>
