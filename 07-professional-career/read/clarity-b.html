  Clarity  B-
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Addresses education&#x27;s lack of conceptual clarity as fundamental barrier to improvement. Don critiques imprecise terminology and boundaries in education discourse, noting education&#x27;s reputation for jargon (&quot;educationese&quot;). Specific examples: &quot;Education and Lifelong Learning&quot; treated as separate when lifelong learning is inherent; &quot;helping young people find a place in society&quot; lacks actionable specificity; Department focuses on &quot;developing and delivering programs&quot; rather than educational outcomes. Calls for clear definitions, comparing PEI&#x27;s approach unfavorably to Alberta&#x27;s (&quot;preparing citizens for tomorrow&quot;) and New Brunswick&#x27;s (&quot;attributes for lifelong learning&quot;).</div>

CALL FOR CONCEPTUAL CLARITY -B</b></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 108%">As
a frequent participant in conversations about education, I am struck
by the absence of definitions and boundaries; communication and
understanding may suffer as a result. 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 108%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 108%">Education
is complex; information plays a key role.  Learners have different
interests, experiences, capabilities and needs; they also fill a
variety of life roles. Those who teach, or other-wise serve learners,
must be very clear in their communication. Conceptual clarity
heightens our understanding of key words and concepts; lack of
clarity is a significant issue for public education. 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 108%">Conceptual
clarity is a must to understand the people we serve, the services we
provide, learner needs, product, processes and values especially when
the subject carries layers of subjectivityClarity must be addressed
directly so that the concept of education won’t become diluted and
potentially ineffective. Lack of clarity may arise from an idea
itself, from the person promoting the idea or from the person
receiving the idea; Lack of clarity could also signal conflicting
ideas and levels of discomfort or disagreement within the education
family group itself and some say  “clarity” is also related to
self confidence.    Conceptual clarify is also a must in planning and
assessing performance. Education has a reputation for generating
“educationese”; in fact, one can purchase an education “jargon
generator”. The existence of a jargon generator is a signal of a
potential Problem.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 108%">EXAMPLES</p>
<ul>
	<li><p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0in">Department
	adopted “Education and Lifelong Learning” in title; are both 
	terms needed? 
	</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0in">Many
	references to “helping  young in society”; doesn’t Department
	serve all -lslanders?</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0in">Philosophy
	paper refers to helping young people to “secure a place” in
	society; How do we design programs to prepare peole for “a 
	place”?</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0in">Department
	refers to its goal as one of “developing and delivering programs”
	to young;” This doesn’t seem to capture the role as visualized
	by most Islanders</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0in">Most
	literature emanating from Department focuses on school matters;
	seldom deal with education issues</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0in">Recent
	report by World Bank cautioned developing countries for treating
	“education” and “going to school” as though they are one and
	the same. Aren’t we doing that also?</p></li>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 108%">Purpose
is key to planning education services and to measuring results; our
neighbours  say it thus:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0in">Alberta
	is “preparing citizens for tomorrow”</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0in">New
	Brunswick is helping citizens gain “attributes needed to be a
	lifelong learner”</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0in">Anon
	“preparing for life, work and citizenship”.</p></li>
