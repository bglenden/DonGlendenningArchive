  Mission 1 
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Don&#x27;s strategic analysis of PEI education mission and scope. Critiques narrow departmental focus on youth-only education, argues for comprehensive lifelong learning framework, and discusses problems with current school system. Proposes broader definition centered on life roles and community outcomes.</div>

<div class="reader-content">
<p><b>What’s the education mission for PEI?</b></p>
<p>Education is complex.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Learners have different interests, experiences, learning styles, capabilities and needs. They also fill a variety of life roles, that of an individual, student, citizen, family member, consumer and producer. The system offers programs, courses, grades, credits, degrees, diplomas and certificates usually at locations and in formats established by providers. Education is confusing to say the least. A clear purpose is essential</p>
<p>In reading PEI documents, I am surprised to find, at least officially, that the department is only interested in the education of young people.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A paper on philosophy of education tells us that the Department helps “students find a meaningful place in society”.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The Department of Education website<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>gives the Department’s role as one of developing and delivering high quality programs and curriculum” to youth. Four things bother me about these statements (1) it under sells its Islanders (4I<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>fail to mention the range of services offered<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>and lacks<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>detail needed to develop programs and to measure progress.</p>
<p>Current school services not sufficient education for tomorrow’s world; it’s time for the Department to step up to the plate.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>One could easily make the case that education is unexplored territory to the Department of education and not of great interest.great interest to those who run schools. in exploring it.</p>
<p>v</p>
<p>chooling has replaced education as the basis of communication. Silos are seldom breached and the task of informing the public is assigned to visiting experts.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></p>
<p>We understand the role of schools, neede for better ventilation and electric buses but citizens wonder why graduates still have problems with every day math, seem not to be able o managr personal finance, or be tuned to the expectations of employers.</p>
<p>Future of education is secure</p>
<p>Schools under pressure to change</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The future of<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>our community and Isladers will depend to a large degree o the nature and level of education of or citizens; all should be encouraged to participae.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Some parts or or seervicesr<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Our education system should serv all Islanders It should promote and encourage education for all,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>But Islanders still want and need to learn more.; to be more self sufficient and to collaborate with others. and to they need information, counselling, instruction, assessment, learning materials and technology. They want a 21t century education menu; ttheey want the fine cuisine of the 21<sup>st</sup> century.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Those who teach, or otherwise serve learners, must be very clear in their understandings and communication. Clarity heightens our understanding of key words and concepts. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Compared to other professions educatiors lack freedom to serve.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>dressed directly so that the concept of education won’t become diluted and potentially ineffective. Lack of clarity may arise form an idea itself, from the person promoting the idea or from the person receiving the idea; Lack of clarity could also signal conflicting ideas and level of discomfort or disagreement from within the group itself and some say<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>it is also thought to be related to self confidence</p>
<p>The writers attention was first drawn to the importance of structure during a series of public discussions of an education report published by the Community foundation a number of years ago.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>( <span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>) Recent discussion, reading and experience have brought it to the forefront. I’ve included some references a the bottom of this article.</p>
<p>My review of education literature and discussion with Islanders suggests a need for changes in the way that public education is structured. Structural iss</p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li2"><b>Need for a clear and compelling vision</b>. Islanders think that the Department of Education has a responsibility for education at all levels; Department of Education documents define Education’s role as serving youth.</li>
  <li class="li2"><b>Equating going to school with getting an education. </b>In a 20i9 report, The World Bank, the world’s largest funder of education services,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>cautioned Ministries of Education about the confusion of treating “education and going to school” as though they are one and the same; a review of PEI education documents suggests that PEI has also fallen into that trap. A school, like a hospital or shopping plaza, at best is only a resource rich location; education is influenced by student experiences while there.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li2"><b>Form follows function</b> is still the standard when structuring any venture; services provided by an education system to learners include information, counselling, instruction, assessment, learning products.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Given this, one would expect senior management to reflect these functions in their position titles and for front line workers to have flexibility in responding to learner needs.</li>
  <li class="li2"><b>Accountability </b>The OECD tells us that PISA results are better from schools with autonomy in their day-to-day operation; the World Bank advises Ministries of Education to delegate. Mathew Bedard of the Montreal Economic Institute points out that “autonomy and accountability jointly applied” would cost practically nothing and allow education to better adapt to the diversity of student needs and aptitudes. Yet teachers and principals in PEI appear to have little freedom to tailor services to suit individual learner needs.</li>
  <li class="li2"><b>Grades and grading</b>, represents an attempt to apply standardized measurement to levels of achievement in a course or program; in the education context, each grade is considered equivalent to one year of study.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Grades also serve as a communication device among educators and the people they serve. My eview of the literature<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>suggests that assessing students for the purpose of assigning levels of proficiency and ranking are not teaching functions</li>
