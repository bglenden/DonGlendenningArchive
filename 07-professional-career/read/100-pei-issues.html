  100 pei Issues. 
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Don&#x27;s comprehensive analysis of critical systemic issues facing PEI&#x27;s education system: lack of clarity in terminology, unclear purpose, fragmented services, poor organizational structure, insufficient autonomy for teachers, weak accountability mechanisms, professional isolation, limited transparency, and inadequate documentation. This document represents Don&#x27;s final assessment of obstacles to education improvement and his call for urgent public action.</div>

<p align="center" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 108%"><b>KEY
ISSUES</b><b>	___________________________________________________________________________</b></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 108%"><b>It is widely
recognized that education Is a key factor in determining a person’s
quality of life. In the same way, the collective education of our
citizens determines ,to a significant degree, the qualities of the
communities in which we live. Education is complex, made so by the
fact that each person is unique in so many ways – unique in basic
physical, emotional and mental make up, unique in the range and
nature of previous experience; unique also in perceived futures and
unique in terms of learning style, interests, pace and needs.</b></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 108%"><b>Given these
complexities, some system-wide issues are not surprising:</b></p>
<ol>
	<li><p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.11in">Clarity
	– a common terminology improves communication throughout the
	organization; the most obvious example, according to the World Bank,
	in the practice of using  the terms “education” and ‘going to
	school” interchangeably.</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0in"><b>Purpose
	</b>– purpose<b>
	</b>sets the stage for
	what we do and how we organize to do it. The
	PEI PEI education literature refers to helping people find “a
	place” in society’; we need to better define that “place”. 
	People are said to fill six life roles, that of an individual,
	citizen, a producer, a consumer, family member and student. All
	roles can benefit from education but all may not need the same
	amount, mix or time. 
	</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0in"><b>Services
	</b><b>–
	Learning is complex;</b>
	support services include: information, counselling, instruction,
	products and technology, quality assurance. governance, funding and
	human resources. Services should be publicly available as needed. . 
	</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.11in"><b>Structure
	</b><b>-</b>”Form
	follows function” is a standard when structuring any venture.
	Departments of Education, however, appear to structure around school
	levels and clients served.</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.11in"><b>Autonomy
	- </b><b>f</b><b>ront
	line service providers (teachers) need both expertise and autonomy
	to respond to learner needs.</b>
	<b>The OECD tells us
	that PISA results are better for students in schools with autonomy
	in their day-to-day operation.</b></p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0in"><b>Accountability
	-</b><b> Mathew
	Bedard of the Montreal Economic Institute points out that “autonomy
	and accountability jointly applied” would cost practically nothing
	and allow education to better adapt to the diversity of student
	needs and aptitudes. </b>
	</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0in"><b>Collaboration
	</b><b>–
	education thrives on collaboration and communication yet teachers
	and schools seem limited to silos.</b></p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0in"><b>Communication</b><b>
	– Paul Bennet speaks of the “muffled voices of teachers” who
	work alone in classrooms; others have noted that the teaching
	profession itself is often a silo in the community.</b></p></li>
</ol>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 108%"><br />

</p>
<ol start="9">
	<li><p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0in"><b>Transparency
	– </b><b>both
	the profession and the community would benefit from increased public
	information and discussion about the field, </b><b>
	</b>
	</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0in"><b>Documentation
	– </b><b>Given
	the size  and  complexity oof he taskm system would benefit   from
	documentation of education components.</b></p></li>
</ol>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 108%"><b>These
issues are not new; no doubt readers have others to propose. All
should be considered. They need to be dealt with</b> <b>in
a public manner soon, and should be dealt with soon.</b></p>
