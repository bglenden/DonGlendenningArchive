<p>EXPECTATIONS OF HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATES</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>High school graduation is an important event in our lives.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We look forward with anticipation and backwards with considerable satisfaction and nostalgia.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Graduation marks a turning point in our lives.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>For many, it means parting with long-time friends, entering college or university, moving from home or finding a job.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Graduation exercises and the related social activities also play a part in our nostalgia.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A high school diploma helps us make many of these transitions.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>But what does, or should, a graduation diploma signify?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Or for that matter, a college or university diploma or degree?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A person with a diploma should be different that one without, or else why have diplomas.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The distinguishing characteristics between a person having a diploma ;and one who does not are not clear to me.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Should we be able, for example, to distinguish between a graduate and a non-graduate without seeing a transcript or diploma?</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Employers like their new employees to be high school graduates.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Why?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>What do they see in a graduate that they do not find in a person who has not graduated?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Or is being a graduate simply a handy screening tool?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If it is the latter, employers are missing out on a vast pool of potential employees.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>A high school graduation diploma is granted on the basis of having completed a specified group of courses and some options for, I believe, a total of 18 credits.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The requirement also includes an acceptable grade.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Prizes and honors go to those who excel.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Current graduation requirements are quite rigidly adhered to and, I am told, although some choice is possible the pressure is on students to take as many of the “traditional” courses as possible I understand the reason for this since schools are judged by the number of students who go to college or university.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The rigid pattern of requirements deters students from broadening their education and exploring areas of interest.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The reason for not encouraging choice, I am told, is that it may affect a student’s chances of acceptance at a university.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I am not aware of any evidence to support one pattern of courses over another.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>About ten years ago, I conducted a survey to try to locate evidence in support of the current pattern of courses required for graduation.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I wrote to every Deputy Minister of Education, college and university presidents in Atlantic Canada and a large number of school superintendents.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I asked them for the evidence to support the graduation requirements.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I received many responses but only one provided information which was relevant to the question.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I understand, on the other hand, that grades earned in high school appear to be a predictor of success in university.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This is not surprising since secondary schools put great effort into preparing students for university and the nature of universities is an extension of that in a secondary school.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Changes are in the offing which, I believe, will more adequately describe the achievement of high school graduates.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This is a result of school focusing more clearly on graduation outcomes and designing programs to help students achieve them.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The four Atlantic Provinces have agreed on the following Essential Graduation Learning’s:</p>
<p>GRADUATES WILL BE ABLE TO:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Respond with critical awareness to various forms of the arts and be able to express themselves through the arts.</p>
<p>Assess social, cultural, economic and environmental interdependence in a local and global context.</p>
<p>Use the listening, viewing, speaking, reading and writing modes of language(s) and mathematical and scientific concepts and symbols to think, learn and communicate effectively.</p>
<p>Continue to learn and to pursue an active, healthy lifestyle.</p>
<p>Use the strategies and processes needed to solve a wide variety of problems, including those requiring language, and mathematical and scientific concepts.</p>
<p>Use a variety of technologies, demonstrate an understanding of technological applications and apply appropriate technologies to solving problems.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Schools are redesigning their programs to help students to meet these outcomes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is an excellent start but more needs to be done.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>First of all, the outcomes need to be expressed in the language of students and the public.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They now reflect the language of educators.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Next, a copy of these expectations should be placed in the hands of every teacher, parent and student so that all will know what is expected in order to graduate.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Then, we need to reconsider how we rate achievement on each outcome.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And, finally, these expectations should form the basis of school transcripts.</p>
