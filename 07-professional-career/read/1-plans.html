<p><b>Office operation in Marla’s absence</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I offered to cover the office during Marla’s absence and propose the following:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I have cancelled a number of appointments, delayed others for the period</p>
<p>I expect to be at the office most days, not all day or each day at the same time.</p>
<p>I suggest the phone message be changed to say that “office will be open on irregular hours for the next month. Mail or packages can be left across the hall, leave a message and we will get back to you</p>
<p>A similar notice to be posted on the door saying that packages can be left across the hall</p>
<p>Incoming mail to be logged, answered or referred as appropriate, to the extent possible I will draft a response for the appropriate signature.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Unless advised otherwise, a Directors mail will be placed in his/her file on the bookcase.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I would appreciate having you note action taken so that the loop can be closed</p>
<p>If you have letters you want typed for signature, please leave them on Marla’s desk</p>
<p>I will need help from the Treasurer on the handling of money both in and out</p>
<p>I am assuming that Lois will file as needed</p>
<p>I will read, answer, forward, delete email as appropriate and maintain a log of all actions.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In some cases I will make a copy in order that messages not get lost<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Not quite sure how to handle I will review Only plan to read emails once a day Responding to <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Please help me monitor tat mail and message sure attended to</p>
