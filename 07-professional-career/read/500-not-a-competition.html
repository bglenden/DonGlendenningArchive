  500 Not a competition
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Don argues schools should not operate on competitive principles despite teaching competition. He advocates for individual learning progress without public grade posting or student ranking, which he views as sorting rather than educating. Don contends that reaching an &quot;A&quot; level is achievable for most students with additional time, questioning why schools artificially limit achievement through time constraints rather than allowing flexible completion. He critiques schools for penalizing students by forcing them to advance before achieving mastery. Notably, he reports that over 50 percent of US high schools had discontinued ranking by the time of writing. Don&#x27;s own memory of a grade 8-9 ranking ceremony lasting impression, prompting lifelong reflection on its impact. He advocates discontinuing ranking and redirecting resources toward raising performance levels for all students.</div>

<p><b>School is not a Competition<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>Whether I stand first or last in my school class is my business and only my business.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I go to school for help with my learning, and I resent my grades being posted for all to see.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If I want someone to know what my grades are, I will tell them.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I have no evidence that posting my grades helps my education.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>On the other hand, if I enter a competition, I expect to be ranked, and have my rank made public.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But enrolling in an educational institution is not a race, not a competition – or it shouldn’t be.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Institutions that rank students and publicize the results are doing their students a disservice.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>While schools may teach competition, it should not be run on a competitive basis.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Reaching an A level of performance in any subject is within reach of most students if given a few more hours of instruction.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If an A is important, why not give students time to reach it?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>How long it takes to learn a skill and how quickly one can perform it are quite separate issues. Grades, at least theoretically, point to how much and how well a student learned in a given period of time; grades do not tell how much a student can do or how well in a given time – and it is the latter that counts outside of school.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Unfortunately, schools place limits on the achievement of many students by making time the constant and achievement the variable.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Instead of designing a system that allows all students to reach the top level, Schools impose time limits that force some students to quit before they reach the level of which they are capable.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Our current arrangement is to allow only one student to reach the top of the mountain each year and is the student, not the school that gets penalized.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Now I am not against student competitions and the recognition of high standing gained therein or for awarding prizes and publicity to winners.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In fact, I think that there should be more competitions and rewards for educational accomplishments.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My view, however, is that such competitions should be outside not inside the school system.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Schools are in the education business not the sorting business; they should not be in the sorting business.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The publication of all grade information is sorting but publication of rank is sorting in its most odious form.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Colleges and universities are and should be free to set the criteria for entrance and to institute their own selection procedures.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Taking this position, I would argue, would allow schools to concentrate on providing a good education and not limit the educational experience to those subjects required for university or college entrance.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Obtaining an education should not be limited to the few courses now required for high school graduation.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>According to what I read, many secondary schools in the USA no longer rank high school students and some who do, refuse to release their rankings to universities and colleges.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I am told that upwards of 50 percent of all high schools have taken this stand.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>My own experience with ranking is limited and ancient.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The one example that comes to mind, however, is a grade eight or nine graduation during which the rank of every student was given.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The event made a lasting impression.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I’ve often wondered about the impact of that event on the students’ future.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Its time to discontinue the practice of ranking students and spend the time gained in increasing their levels of performance.</p>
