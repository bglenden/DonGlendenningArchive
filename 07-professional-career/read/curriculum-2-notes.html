  Curriculum-2 `Notes
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Synthesizes curriculum development research and Don&#x27;s personal analysis of PEI education needs. Reviews provincial education literature (Alberta, Ontario, BC, Canada 2020) and emerging competency-based approaches. Discusses William Spady&#x27;s philosophy that practitioners, not educators alone, should identify outcomes. Notes that curriculum-based outcomes appear unique to Canada. Reports conversations with Island employers, parents, students, and educators revealing gaps in understanding of curriculum terms (outcomes, competencies, skills). Addresses mathematics education as key competency for new economy while remaining underperforming goal. Provides detailed observations and recommendations for PEI system improvements, including adoption of competency basis, dynamic rating scales, and independent assessment body.</div>

<b>EDUCATION</b></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Our
futures and the future of our community will depend in large measure
on the nature and level of education gained by our citizens.
Provinces encourage their have a responsibility to develop attitudes,
skills and knowledge needed to function in the 21<sup>st</sup>
century; they also have a responsibility to ensure that their
communities have the skilled people needed to care for the community
in which they live.   A 2003
multi-country study by the European Commission found that, if the
national average educational attainment level is increased by a
single year, aggregate productivity increases by 6.2 per cent right
away and by a further 3.1 per cent in the long run.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">In
most Provinces education is offered through a public-school system
devoted to serving the needs of young people, a relatively autonomous
postsecondary sector, and a conglomeration of services operated or
administered through provincial ministries of training and
development as ell as skills gained through informal and self study
and often on a self-supporting basis.

<ul>
	<li><p style="orphans: 2; margin-bottom: 0in; widows: 2; line-height: 100%">

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><b>MATHEMATIC
EDUCATION</b></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Mathematics
is considered one of the key competencies needed to prepare people
for he new economy and, for the most part, is organized around the
conventional structure of mathematics: arithmetic, algebra, geometry,
trigonometry, calculus, probability and statistics.  The
goal for students of PEI Grade 9 mathematics is to “become
mathematically literate adults”.  It is an achievable goal, at
least for most students but, if math test scores and public comment
are used as the measure, the goal remains a challenge rather than an
accomplishment.

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><span lang="en-US">Provider
who deliver to youth follow a curriculum approved by the Department
of Education based on a Curriculum Based Outcomes model.  Other
providers base math instruction on a from a variety of sources.  On
the other side of the coin, “receivers” of students have a
variety of math interests and needs not always well documented or
understood.  A common menu of available math “ingredients”;
master list of math skills or competencies exist elsewhere with the
best known likely being Common Core State Standards in the USA.  </span>

	<li><p style="orphans: 2; margin-bottom: 0in; widows: 2; line-height: 100%">
	<span lang="en-US">One
	of the common failures of outcomes and competency based instruction
	is the failure to separate the analysis step from that of curriculum
	development; separation greatly increases flexibility, adds to its
	value as a counselling and tracking tool and increases the uses to
	which analyses can be put. </span>
