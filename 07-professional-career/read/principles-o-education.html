<p><b>Evaluation</b></p>
<p><b>1.	Skills required in an occupational field should be identified by persons in the field</b></p>
<p><b>2.	Students are responsible for their own progress</b></p>
<p><b>3.	Learning should be stressed instead of teaching</b></p>
<p><b>4.	The role of the instructor is to assess, diagnose, prescribe, tutor but not to<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>be the sole conveyor of education</b></p>
<p><b>5.	Programs should be individualized to the extent that resources allow</b></p>
<p><b>6.	the College should operate on a year- round basis</b></p>
<p><b>7.	We should schedule resources, rooms, materials and instructors instead of students</b></p>
<p><b>8.	Evaluation should be as realistic and meaningful as possible in keeping with evaluation in the work environment</b></p>
<p><b>9.	We should maximize student<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>staff interaction</b></p>
<p><b>10.	Students should be able to enter and exit from a program at any time</b></p>
<p><b>11.	Advanced credit should be given for proven performance</b></p>
<p><b>12.	Students should be able to continue their learning program in a systematic way even after leaving the college</b></p>
<p><b>13.	Ratings are based on performance, not attendance</b></p>
<p><b>14.	Instructors are accountable for student progress</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>The ultimate goal of education is to help people to function well in a<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>variety of life roles</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>The teaching of essential skills (literacy, numeracy, critical thinking, digital navigation) will be a priority</b></p>
<p><b>Educational programs shall be based on clear and measurable education outcomes.</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Schools will be performance based not time based.</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Learning is an individual matter although it may take place in a group setting.</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Separate qualification fro teaching institutions<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b>Levels of achievement need to be clearly defined and met before diplomas awarded</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Every student entering school should have a reasonable expectation of completing a program.</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>An investment in education and learning should be driven by some core principles – principles that commit us to a vision of schooling that focuses on excellence, supports differences and makes sure we do not loose out on the global “war for talent”.</b></p>
<p><b>Ability comes in many forms and learners need to be supported to enjoy success no matter where their talents lie – education is not just for and about “academics” – we need to be a Province rich in all the talents.</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>The educational success of learners should not depend on the background or social status or economic characteristics of learners and their families. Schools, communities and families must work together to close gaps in attainment and give each learner the opportunity to find their talent, nurture that talent and be excellent. Success for all requires a significant investment in early childhood learning - without this, learners and the community spend their resources “catching up” rather than developing the talents of their learners.</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Education should engage the learner with exciting, relevant content and opportunities for learning through experience and doing. The curriculum should balance abstract and practical knowledge so that every learner can access high quality knowledge and skills as well as vocational opportunities. Teachers should be able to add adapt and develop curriculum – it should not be “over-prescribed” by the Province.</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Education should help learners to understand how to be healthy and happy and support them in their efforts to develop and maintain their emotional, physical and mental well-being. Schools should recognize that learning takes place both in and outside of schools – we need to facilitate, enable and recognize learning from a variety of different settings.</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Education must be a partnership.</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>The education of Albertans should be a partnership of schools, parents and the wider community in a local area. Learners have a valuable role to play in contributing to the design of their own learning, and in shaping the way their learning environment operates.</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Every place of learning should be different and innovative and we must find meaningful, yet effective, ways of holding schools to account for their performance that reward rather than stifle innovation and creativity.Every teacher should be a creative professional involved in the design of curricula and learning environments, and should be supported and supported in their acquisition of appropriate skills to fulfill that role.</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Decisions in education should respect the rights of learners as citizens.</b></p>
<p><b>To the extent possible, learners should have a choice of what they learn, when they learn</b></p>
