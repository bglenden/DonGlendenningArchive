<p>Subject:	Glenway Bylaws</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Greetings from Clearwater Beach; we’ve been here a couple of weeks and enjoying it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Weather has been great.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Not doing much but enjoying it anyway.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>We have been having much difficulty with our internet while in Florida; mostly a problem with the hotel internet service but, besides that, I am able to receive messages but not send them except via my web mail.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is a nuisance to say the least.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We usually visit the library daily to read the papers and use the internet.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As a result, this note comes as an attachment rather than just an Email message.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I’ve finally gotten back to the subject of my earlier Email and I thank you for your comments.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In fact, I have immersed myself in reading the bylaws and recasting some key Articles consistent with your thoughts; I am satisfied that we can make it work as you propose but also think that expanding the number of Directors is also an alternative.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Let me recap.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The residents of Glenway brought into being an Association to protect its interests and carry on its business.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We did this through lengthy discussions; participation was both encouraged and allowed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I recall at least some participants expressing an interest in retaining the model, a view that I certainly support. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Since then, and on reflection, I am of the view that our current constitution and bylaws interfere with the consultative process rather than foster it; furthermore, I believe that a broader consultative process should be restored and reinforced.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I would like to see all/most business concluded directly by residents rather than delegated to some and ratified by all later.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The issue, therefore, really about the extent to which we want to open the decision-making process to all residents.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>To do this, changes in, or interpretations of, the constitution and by laws will be required. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>As you know, I am active in the Community Foundation of Prince Edward Island (CFPEI.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Our constitution allows for members although we do not have any at the moment; the Association also has 12 Directors and the customary officers; the role of the Executive is to act if needed between meetings of the Directors.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>For many years we operated only through meetings of all Directors.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In recent years, however, we have also been holding Executive meetings as well as committee meetings. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Earlier this year, I sent a note to the President, who is also in Florida as I write, suggesting that we dispense with Executive meetings and revert to a model whereby all our business is conducted only by Directors.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I made this recommendation based on my perception that (1) too much Director time, much duplicative, is spent on administrative matters, (2) CFPEI has become less participative than formerly, (3) new Directors are not getting the orientation to and knowledge about CFPEI that they need, (4) Board has become fragmented.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>How he President will react, I do not know but the recommendation reflects my views and, I believe, is consistent with what I believe about the operation of our Association.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>CFPEI also has an annual and open annual meeting, which is usually very brief, where it deals with the kind of agenda as provided for in our bylaws.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Having said this, Wally, I certainly open to either alternative but believe that the simplest way to accommodate my concerns would be to encourage a larger Board. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I trust that you and Val had a good winter; I realize that you may well be in Spain as I write; if so, enjoy yourselves and have a great family visit.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Regards</p>
<p><br></p>
