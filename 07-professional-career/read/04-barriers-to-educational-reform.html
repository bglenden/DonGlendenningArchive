  04 Barriers to educational reform
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Don identifies three overlooked barriers to educational reform: employer recruitment practices that contradict their stated need for employability skills, professional certification requirements locked into traditional course offerings, and rigid college/university entrance requirements. He argues employers should lead by basing hiring on competencies rather than credentials; professionals should base designations on performance not time served; and post-secondary institutions should relax course rigidity. He ends optimistically: with ministerial directives, reform could advance through hiring and promotion based on competencies rather than credentials.</div>

<p><b>Barriers to educational reform</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>The clamor for educational reform, like the sounds of the holiday season, is all around us.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It’s exciting and full of promise.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Through educational reform we can right all wrongs, develop a highly skilled labor force, compete internationally, rescue drop-outs, improve the standards of education, reduce numbers on UI and welfare, reduce annual deficit and many other good things.</p>
<p>Now don’t get me wrong; I’m all for educational reform.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Every endeavor requires periodic assessment to review and restate goals and objectives, to realign organizational structures, to provide a new sense of coherence to its activities.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Education is no exception.</p>
<p>Current educational reforms include reducing the number of school boards, centralizing hiring and purchasing practices, cutting down on the number of non-school based administrators, introducing outcomes-based education, contracting some services now provided by people on the educational payroll, hiring new (and less expensive) staff, and delivering instruction using the latest technology.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And the list goes on, and on, and on.</p>
<p>But change doesn’t come easy.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There are all kinds of reasons why changes are delayed, not implemented, or get sidetracked.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Each of us could prepare our own list of reasons and there would be considerable overlay.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Most lists would include such things as inertia in the system, tradition, the system does not require changing, lack of political will, too many aging administrators, lack of leadership, outmoded teacher education programs, insufficient funding, poor motivation by students, lack of parental support, teacher unions and loss of control to the professionals.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And this list could also go on.</p>
<p>But there are other barriers which are seldom, if ever, mentioned.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>These include recruitment practices of employers, certification and licensing regulations and entrance requirements to universities and colleges.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The remainder of my column will be devoted to these three areas.</p>
<p>Many of the discordant notes about education come from the business community.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Criticism and suggestions for change abound.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The actions of these critics, do not give credence to their words.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Employers tell us that schools should give more attention to both personal and employment skills.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The employability skills identified by the Conference Board of Canada resulted from, I believe, significant consultation with employers.</p>
<p>If one examines recruitment practices, however, one sees little reference to the skills that employers ask schools to develop.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Take a look at your copy of the list of employability skills and then look at the help wanted section of your newspaper.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Do the two lists match?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If employers believe that the employability skills are important shouldn’t they use them in constructing their recruitment advertisements?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The largest employer of all, the public service, should lead the way in this reform.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If employers do that, schools, colleges and universities will soon pay attention.</p>
<p>Another barrier to reform is the requirements by professional associations to obtain a professional designation.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>These are often stated in terms of traditional course offerings.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Ay educational institution which dares to provide a transcript which doesn’t fit the mould may be jeopardizing its graduates.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I know because I had to deal with the problem in the past for students from Holland College.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I also remember when the requirement for a degree was first introduced for CA’s.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And there are more recent examples.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A professional designation, like a graduation certificate should be based on performance not on time served.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I know that some associations have moved towards performance-based assessment but many still have not.</p>
<p>The final barrier which I will mention is that of college and university entrance requirements.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Of the three barriers, this is the most obvious.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Post secondary institutions require successful completion of a very rigid set of courses in order for students to be accepted.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>While I have not done an exhaustive survey of the matter, my reading and discussion with other educators leaves me without evidence to support their position.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>On the other hand, I am not arguing for a lack of study of any of the current disciplines, but for the rigidity of the requirements.</p>
<p>But let me not leave you with an altogether bleak picture.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Ministers of education and employers can make a significant step toward educational reform.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And they can do it with the stroke of a pen.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>What is required is a directive to officials that henceforth recruitment and hiring will be on the basis of competencies, skills or outcomes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And I am using these terms interchangeably for performance; you may choose what4ever term suits your purpose.</p>
