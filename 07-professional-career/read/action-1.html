  Action 1
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Action-oriented paper addressing PEI education&#x27;s communication and organizational failures. Don claims lifelong education engagement and notes definition confusion between education and schooling (World Bank 2018 citation). Criticizes Department&#x27;s narrow curriculum-development focus when its true role is helping Islanders gain information, insights, and skills. Notes missing education definition in revised PEI Schools Act. Advocates structuring around function (helping Islanders thrive) rather than school operations. Proposes &quot;form follows function&quot; organizational principle. Argues Department should frame role expansively beyond school operations. Dated Feb 18/24, signed Don Glendenning. Emphasizes implementation as &quot;daily business&quot; rather than disruptive change.</div>

<b>Education is a large,

<ol>
	<li><p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0in"><b>There
	is a tendency to use education and school/schooling interchangeably;
	World Bank called attention to it in their 2018 report. It is
	causing problems on PEI as well.</b></p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0in"><b>Seems
	to me a Depatrment of Education needs a definition of education. My
	search of Department literature did not turn up a definition of
	Education. In fact,  I was informed that  a definition of education
	was left out of the PEI Schools AcL during a recent revision. A
	working definition is needed for clarity and should be developed and
	distributed generously throughout the system.</b></p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0in"><b>The
	Department describes its role as one of “developng and delivering
	high quality programs and curriculum.”  While the Department does
	this, I suggest that the the Department’s role is much, much
	greater, that of helping Islanders gain new information insights and
	skills.</b></p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0in"> <b>Government
	structure Departments around branches or fields of work;  In the
	case of education, however, structuring is based on levels of
	schooling – a major diversion from its real role.</b></p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0in">“<b>Form
	follows function “is an organizational maxim. The function of
	public education, I suggest, is to help Islanders gain knowledge,
	attitudes, skills and other attributes needed to thrive in future
	years. Instead, The Department of Education seems to be organized
	around the running of schools </b>
