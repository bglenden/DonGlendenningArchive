  System 9 spedial summary
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Dated draft 24/06/22. Largely mirrors System 6 content with 30 foundational beliefs and detailed analysis of PEI&#x27;s education structure. Key addition: examination of the &quot;PEI Community&quot; (160,000 people with wide interests, capabilities, and varied learning motivations). Document emphasizes that &quot;schools are organizational arrangement[s]&quot; for delivering services and reducing costs through specialization. Critiques observation that education philosophy merely references helping students find &quot;a place&quot; without clarity about meaning. Proposes several concrete actions including common definitions list, independent learner category, PEI Education Association, Education Council advisory body, role-reflective titles, and performance review mechanisms.</div>

future as individuals and as a community will be determined, in large
measure, by the nature and level of education demonstrated by our
citizens. Education is an umbrella concept and includes all
experiences that have had an impact on the way we think, feel and act
wherever those experiences occur and however they are triggered. The
key to a person’s education, the literature tells us, are early
experiences triggered in and through the home and family, followed by
the influence of teachers</b></p>

in Canada is a provincial responsibility; the role of a Province is
to promote, support and regulate services; in the case of PEI, the
Province is the chief deliverer. Although education services are not
separately identified they appear to be mainly delivered through
schools, colleges and universities and limited to students who are
enrolled in the various institutions. thus, giving rise to a
fragmented system. As a result, the writer argues, PEI is serviced by
a school system rather than an education system. This paper reports
on the writer’s exploration of the subject.</b></p>

accomplishing goals, completing assignments and making decisions that
deliver on expectations; people resist and fail to support what they
