  Czar
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">A creative thought experiment where Glendenning imagines himself as education czar with absolute authority to implement five transformative changes: (1) assigning each student a permanent educational advisor (like a family doctor) responsible for guidance through K-12; (2) separating teaching and credentialing functions into distinct organizations (like City and Guilds); (3) allowing learners choice of any teacher/school with student transportation; (4) replacing teacher compensation based on knowledge and experience with performance-based pay reflecting work done, complexity, and merit; and (5) replacing Department of Education bureaucracy with accountability to teachers for student learning. The piece reveals Don&#x27;s frustrations with institutional inertia while offering concrete reform proposals grounded in his philosophy.</div>

<p><b>45 Czar for a Day or maybe even two days</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>It would be fun to be Czar for a day; Putin is not likely to step aside so I’ll limit myself to being an educational Czar.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As Czar, one could make significant changes knowing that they could not be over-ruled by the Minister, watered down by the superintendent or principal or rejected by the teachers' union. I find that it is not teachers but rather administrators and teachers' unions that are most likely to oppose change.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>My initial list was a long one and included such changes as placing more freedom and accountability at the individual school level, clearer standards, clearer differentiation of levels of performance, clearer lines of accountability, more freedom for teachers to make professional decisions, changing the emphasis from time served to performance, emphasizing communication skills and merit pay.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Introducing those changes would be more than one could accomplish in one day so I decided to limit myself to five.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Here they are:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>First</b> would be to require each student to have an “education advisor” with a role similar to that of a family doctor.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Most of us would not be very happy if we had a new family doctor each year, especially if it was not of our choosing.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The education advisor would, for the most part, provide advice and direction for at least K through 12, however, students could elect to change advisors but advisors would have no choice in selecting students except because of a heavy workload.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As with a family doctor, the educational advisor would work with a learner and advice and direct the learner in a course of action intended to meet the learner’s educational goals; an educational advisor would also have authority to place students with specialist teachers as necessary. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Student transcripts would be signed off by the educational advisor. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Second,</b> I would separate the teaching and the sorting functions, that is, if degrees and diplomas are thought to be important, set up one or more qualification authorities to provide them, not unlike the City and Guilds in England or the New Zealand Qualification Authority.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I believe that teaching and sorting are two entirely separate functions and having teachers and institutions both teach and sort constitutes a conflict of interest.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If degrees and diplomas are important to employers or certification bodies, and they seem to be, then let them set up an organization to award them.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The cost of examinations and awarding degrees and diplomas would be met through an examination fee. Any individual should be able to challenge for credit at any time regardless of whether or not they have taken formal courses in the subject being tested.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Third </b>would be to give learners a choice of any teacher and any school but it would be up to the student to transport himself or herself to the chosen institution.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Obviously, choice will be greatest in larger centres but that is the same for any service.<b><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span></b>Excess demand for a teacher would be dealt with in the same way as excess demand on a lawyer or Dentist.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This change would demand considerable creativity, however, choice seems to be an expectation in other walks of life so why not in education.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If we believe in choice, we will find a way to bring it about</p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Four</b> is to replace the current system of teacher pay from one that emphasizes what the teacher knows to what a teacher does.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Currently teacher pay is based on a grid emphasizing years of<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>training and years of experience.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It needs to be replaced with a system that takes into account the work done, number of people served, complexity of task, and perhaps even merit.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Some, but not necessarily all, should be able to dramatically increase their earnings; the current system, I feel, holds back deserving teachers.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The top of the salary range needs to be moved up dramatically; teachers should be able to earn as much as a lawyer, accountant, dentist or a medical doctor.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The current hierarchical system and basis for calculating earnings does not allow this to happen. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There should also be room for pay arrangements to reflect numbers of students taught and relative complications of their specialties.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Five </b>would be to change the focus of the Departments of Education.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>From my perspective, teachers are prevented from being professionals by the limits placed upon them.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Get rid of the bureaucracy and hold the teacher accountable for student learning.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Teachers will rise to the occasion. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Of course, some administration will still be required by the Ministry of Education but teachers or students will be better served by having specialists in evaluation, diagnosis, remedial skills, and testing and evaluation in much as the health system has specialists to which patients are referred from time to time.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>When I make these suggestions in casual conversation I frequently hear “But that would be difficult”</p>
