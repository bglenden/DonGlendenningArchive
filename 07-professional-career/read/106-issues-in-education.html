<p><b>BACKGROUND</b></p>
<p><b><span class="Apple-converted-space">              </span></b></p>
<p>Issues are topics, problems or concerns of importance to groups of people; they are the big questions.<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Issues are not simple problems for which definitive answers can easily be found.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>On the contrary, they are complex and of significance. Once understood, the simpler questions can be dealt with and progress resumed. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It’s not always easy to describe an issue in precise terms; sometimes we confuse issues with symptoms and incidents.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>An issue may be current, that is a problem of today; emerging and potential issues, on the other hand, focus on those threats and opportunities that are like to impact on life tomorrow.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But the field is messy.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Issues arise in a variety of ways but often become of concern when they impact on personal interests, activities or events, or are related in some way to concerns of friends or family.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When trying to sort through issues, it is often useful to begin one’s analysis with the basic questions of who, what, when, where and why.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It may also be useful to browse or skim broadly in the field, such as browsing the internet, to get a feel for the issues.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In the case of education, while the organization is mine</p>

<p>Issues arise in a variety of ways but often become of concern when they impact on personal interests, activities or events, or are related in some way to concerns of friends or family.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When trying to sort through issues, it is often useful to begin one’s analysis with the basic questions of who, what, when, where and why.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It may also be useful to browse or skim broadly in the field, such as browsing the internet, to get a feel for the issues.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In the case of education, a scan of the internet quickly revealed three subtopics, research on issues, educational issues in Canada and education issues today. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p><b>ISSUE 1 : ORGANIZATIONAL CLARITY</b></p>
<p>Education suffers from the lack of clarity at the operating level.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Some examples:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Philisophy</p>
<p>Policy</p>
<p>Roles</p>
<p>Language of learning</p>
<p>Role of schools</p>
<p><br></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li6">Common practice of using education and schooling interchangeably. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li6">Clear statement of basic beliefs, values, definitions, what constitutes an education, role of the state, <span>principles, who decides, teaching and sorting</span></li>
  <li class="li11">Outcome statements Dr. William Spady, a sociologist and founder of the Network for Outcomes Based Schools, is widely credited with founding Outcomes Based Education (OBE).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Outcome statements always include an action word that identifies the performance to be demonstrated; some OBE users consider assessment criteria part of the outcome while others treat assessment as a separate issue.</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>ISSUE 2: ACCOUNTBILITY</b></p>

<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li6">Widely dispersed</li>
  <li class="li6">Not well defined<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Act, couldn’t find job description for principals or teachers, valuable tool for discussing role and performance<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li6">Unclear who is accountable for student learning, Appears to rest with principals not teachers, wonder if theyir roles are really at the professional level; Teachers lack opportunity for professional decision making – hallmark of a professional</li>
  <li class="li6">Diffused – no one person develops<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>an understanding of student neets or is charged withhelping, implied contract with teachwe, school or principal</li>

<p><b></b><br></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li6">Education and schooling used interchangeably, they are not the same, School system not an<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>education system, terms used inchangeably leads to confusion;m disservice to both results in the non-school based component being down played or even left out</li>
  <li class="li6">Inflated value of credentials by all stakeholders. Real test of education is what you can do with what you know; that is the role of qualifications<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li6">Lacks support for qualifications</li>
  <li class="li6">OBE, focused mostly on curriculum, outcomes need to be cast in terms of real life, curriculum outcomes support teaching but do little to support learning,</li>
  <li class="li6">Early years development not schooling, schooling appears to be creeping down into ECE, sufficiently important to have own focus like adult educatioin</li>
  <li class="li6">Would appear that only instruction counts, Independent learnerslittle recognition for what one learns on ones own, complicatied process for gerttring credit, not encouraged, Need to encourage not just schooling</li>
  <li class="li6">Schools have a postsecondary focus, little attention to employment skills,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li6">Technology over emphasized, public complaint is about basic skills, Lacks attention to basic skills; ideal education</li>

<p><b>ISSUE<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>: INFORMATION AND ADVICE</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>The process of getting an education is a complex one; it involves developing the knowledge, skills and attitudes that enable us to live a full and productive life; choices abound and each choice has its own consequences.<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Families have a family doctor, perhaps a financial advisor, often an accountant, sometimes a lawyer and perhaps other advisers, but when it comes to education, a much more complex field, learners and families are left on their own. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Jan Hodges (“Careers education needs to be an ongoing dialogue, in which information is discussed at every stage”, Manchester Guardian, Wednesday, May 29) identified the need to expand existing school-based counselling with “independent advice and guidance” about career education for 16-18 year-old youth; information would be directed not only to young people but also to their parents and teachers.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The need for advice on educational matters, however, exists well beyond careers and school walls; people of all ages could benefit from information, counseling, direction, advice and sometimes just an attentive ear.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Guidance counselors work with students in school; educational advisors would be available to anyone but would mostly serve people not in school. <span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></p>
