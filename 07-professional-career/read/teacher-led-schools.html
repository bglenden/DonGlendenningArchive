  Teacher-led Schools
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Don&#x27;s analysis of emerging teacher-led school movement, featuring case study of Palmer Park Preparatory Academy (Detroit, K-8, principal-less, union-member teachers). Identifies significance: teachers as professionals willing to be accountable; union concerned with education quality not just working conditions; school boards confident in experimental models. Other examples: Boston Teachers Union School (K-8, 2005), Minnesota EdVisions charter network (1990s), Math and Science Leadership Academy Denver (union-designed, team coverage, peer evaluation, individual attention), Milwaukee teacher cooperatives running dozen schools. Notes two management models: MSLA model with one/two managing teachers as partners; Law Firm model with manager reporting to partners&#x27; committee. Cites Education Evolving finding that teacher-led schools show higher morale, less turnover, greater improvement motivation—analogous to business ownership versus employment. Sources education journalist Stacy Teicher Khadaroo (Christian Science Monitor), Walt Gardner (Education Week), and online resources. Demonstrates Don&#x27;s continuing engagement with innovative governance and delivery models even in retirement years.</div>

Palmer Park Preparatory
Academy is a school without a principal; this Detroit school is
teacher led, and teachers are union members.  And Palmer Park,
serving students in k-8 grades, is not alone in the move to give
teachers both increased freedom and accountability.

Walt Gardner reports “That's because schools that are run by
teachers report higher morale, less turnover and greater motivation
to improve, according to Education Evolving, a St. Paul policy group
specializing in the matter. The finding is not surprising, since
teachers have a more direct professional stake in these schools. It's
analogous to owning one's own business, rather than being merely an
employee.”</p>
