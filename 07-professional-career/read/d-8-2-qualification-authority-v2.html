  D-8-2 Qualification Authority v2
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Occasional Paper D-8 proposing Canadian national qualification framework and independent assessment authority. Don argues for distinction between credentials (diplomas) and qualifications (demonstrated capability), using labour mobility examples and international models. Advocates for PEI government to lead development of qualification authority to improve school-to-work transition and economic competitiveness. Signature shows Don as author.</div>

	Labour
	mobility is a fact of life; our ancestors practiced it, so have most
	of us.  The difference is that circumstances around us have changed,
	employment numbers have increased, the pace has quickened and people
	travel further afield.  Labour
	mobility
	refers to the movement of people from one part of the country to
	another. While many provinces experience high migrant and immigrant
	labour mobility, Prince Edward Island’s mobility pattern of
	interprovincial migrants from within Canada is one of the lowest.
	One example may be seen in the regular commute of Islanders between
	their home in PEI and their workplace in Alberta, another is the
	retraining needed when a town is devastated by a plant closing, and
	a third example of mobility is the education and experience that
	allows young people to live and work around the world. Labour
	mobility may be hampered geographic ties, absence of housing,
	unemployment benefits, licensing requirements, lack of portable
	qualifications, and lack of nationally recognized educational
	levels. 
	</p>
	<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0.14in">Part of the
	mobility problem is the confusion between credentials and
	qualifications.  Diplomas and degrees are credentials; they are
	awarded to people who have successfully completed a prescribed
	number and pattern of courses in an institution. Given the huge
	variability of student expectations in each course and from one
	program of study to the next, it is understandable that graduates
	range in ability as is documented by grades spanning 50 to 100
	points. Graduates holding a credential do not necessarily mean they
	are ready for the demands of the workforce. We differentiate
	credentials from qualifications in that a qualification attests to
	the fact that the holder has demonstrated the attitudes, skills and
	knowledge required to successfully perform in a role or at a task
	deemed essential by a prospective employer. It is probable that
	graduates holding credentials are more likely have many of the
	qualifications required by an employer but not necessarily a
	complete set. Hence we argue that there is a significant difference
	between the two where the
	credential implies that the holder knows something, in comparison,
	the qualification is a measure of what the holder can do with what
	he or she knows.  There is a need for a qualifications authority; a
	body established under law and given the authority to assess and
	certify a person’s attitudes, skills and knowledge
	that is congruent to employment demands.

	</p>
	<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><span lang="en-US">Given
	the absence of a qualifications authority, we have training
	institutions issuing transcripts and credentials of their own
	making. Attempts that have been made that focused on input measures
	rather output, longer days, more subjects, additional technology,
	and more training (e.g., teachers and school administrators). One
	exception is </span>apprenticeship (a provincial responsibility)
	where provinces have found a way to both honour the jurisdictional
	boundaries and, at the same time, produce a qualification document
	recognized across the country.  This has been accomplished through
	common analyses, both provincial and national examinations and an
	endorsement known as the Red Seal.  Other exceptions include the
	work of the Royal Canadian conservatory of Music.<span lang="en-US">

	</p>
	<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Canada needs a
	qualification framework and an independent body to run it.  Such an
	authority would assess and certify a person’s level of performance
	on a task or set of tasks such as found in an occupation or field of
	study. For example, a qualifications authority would reduce, if not
	eliminate, the confusion between (a) teaching where teachers employ
	formative assessment practices to promote student learning and (b)
	sorting students through summative assessment practices. The
	qualifications authority would focus certification more clearly on
	performance that matters, support lifelong learning, and
	self-directed study and thereby allow schools to focus on formative
	assessment practices that serve to help students learn. A
	qualification authority would, in effect, serve two clients,
	organizations (i.e., employers) desiring an assessment of
	prospective employees and individuals wanting to confirm the level
	and suitability of their qualifications. While qualification
	authorities we have reviewed, focus on approving courses,
	accrediting institutions, and analyzing current offerings; we
	believe in a qualification authority that assesses individuals
	directly, not one that massages the minutiae of hours, outcomes,
	teacher qualification of education providers. A qualification
	authority could also play a useful role in helping people identify
	gaps in their preparation for a given field of work.  
	</p>
	<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">We support a
	qualification authority that is independent with its own governing
	structure, accepts clients on direct application or by referral and
	issues certificates as appropriate based on demonstrated
	performance. Additionally, the authority could (on request) provide
	applicants with information on learning gaps in certification
	requirements. A qualification authority would not, however, organize
	competitions, rank students, or grant credentials.  The main
	functions of a qualification authority would be to:<span lang="en-US"><b>

	</p>
	<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><span lang="en-US">A
	review of the literature certainly supports the value of a
	qualification framework. Benefits of the qualification framework
	used in other countries include: easing the assessment burden on
	teachers and the school system, improving the consistency in
	reporting achievement, helpful in comparing foreign credentials,
	easing the mobility process, improving communications between and
	among education stakeholders, e</span><span lang="en-US">ncourage
	self- study, reducing the problem of grade inflation, and send an
	almost instant widespread recognition of what a person is able to
	do.  Governments in most countries have taken the leadership in
	developing a qualification framework. In the US, this impetus
	appears to be coming primarily from the private sector.  Given that
	education in Canada is a Provincial responsibility, it is unlikely
	that the Government of Canada will move to fill the void.  Hence
	this niche waiting to be filled is in the hands of the Provinces to
	band together or the private sector. We are appealing to the
	government of Prince Edward Island to be a leader in this area and
	support the implementation of a qualifications authority that would
	strengthen Prince Edward Island’s economic outlook through
	bridging school to work transition. It is imperative to initiate the
	necessary steps soon; otherwise, US agencies are likely to fill this
	niche in Canada by default.</span></p>
