Hi John,<br>
<br>
Further to our exchange of messages yesterday, I confirm that I have<br>
reviewed the original trust agreement which established the trust in<br>
1973 ("the 1973 agreement"), and I have reviewed the draft document you<br>
provided, which it proposed to transfer the entire trust to the<br>
Community Foundation of Prince Edward Island.  You have requested that I<br>
review and comment on same on your behalf alone as a trustee to this<br>
trust fund.  My comments are as follows:<br>
<br>
1.  It is permissible for the trustees to transfer the trust funds in<br>
the manner proposed as section 4 of the 1973 agreement states, in part:<br>
<br>
" ... the Trustees may in their absolute discretion, provided that all<br>
Trustess agree, and with the consent of the<br>
Lieutenant-Governor-in-Council, at any time or times, pay to or for the<br>
use or benefit of the Minor Hockey Council of Prince Edward Island the<br>
entire capital or such part or parts of the capital of the trust funds<br>
as they deem advisable provided that such funds are used by the Minor<br>
Hockey Council of Prince Edward Island for the purposes set out in<br>
section 3 hereof......" <br>
<br>
Section 3 of the 1973 agreement states the purpose the said trust funds<br>
are to be used for:<br>
<br>
" ... and shall pay the net income derived therefrom to the Minor<br>
Hockey Council of Prince Edward Island to be used by the Council in its<br>
discretion for improvement of the Minor Hockey Program on Prince Edward<br>
Island covering all classifications up to and inlcuding juvenile<br>
classification and provided such expenditures are within the aims and<br>
objectives of the Prince Edward Island Minor Hockey Council."<br>
<br>
Accordingly, the transfer is appropriate if the purpose is complied<br>
with and continued.  This should thus be clear in the new agreement, and<br>
isn't really (see proposed section 3). I would suggest adding some type<br>
of preamble, or declaratory provision added (perhaps add on to proposed<br>
section 3?) to the new agreement confirming that the trustees are now<br>
desirous of transferring the capital of the trust fund to CFPEI, and<br>
that the trustees have the authority to do so and are doing so pursuant<br>
to section 4 of the 1973 agreement, and for the continued purpose set<br>
out in section 3 of the 1973 agreement.<br>
<br>
2.  The consent of the LGIC is required for this transfer.  I would<br>
presume, John, that this means obtaining and EC Order, or decision at<br>
least.  I'd also add a provision to the body of the new agreement<br>
confirming this consent, as well as the consent of the MHCPEI, rathering<br>
than simply having them both sign at the end of the document.<br>
<br>
3. What happens to the capital if CFPEI is ever wound up?  Perhaps this<br>
is covered off in the Statement of Investment Policies and Procedures,<br>
to be attached as Schedule A, which I don't have a copy of.<br>
<br>
4.  I'd like to see a release clause added whereby you, on behalf of<br>
the Province, released from any and all future obligations and liability<br>
with respect to the trust funds.  I'm not sure how the CFPEI would feel<br>
about executing such a release, but the beneficiary, MHCPEI, should find<br>
this acceptable since it is already consenting to the transfer.  Perhaps<br>
the other two trustees would also be desirous of such a provision being<br>
added as well.<br>
<br>
5.  I'm not certain what the section 8 in the new agreement is<br>
referencing but I assume is has already been determined that the MHCPEI<br>
is a qualified recipient and thus is eligible to recieve the annual<br>
grants?<br>
<br>
6.  The new agreement needs witness lines for execution for all except<br>
Government, and I'd put the date at the top if all parties are signing<br>
at different times?<br>
<br>
Those are my thoughts at this point John, please let me know if you<br>
would like me to review your final document once agreed to by all other<br>
parties.  Thanks, enjoy the day.<br>
<br>
best regards,<br>
<br>
Janice</p>
