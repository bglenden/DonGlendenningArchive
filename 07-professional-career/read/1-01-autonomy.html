  1-01 Autonomy
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Detailed examination of school autonomy&#x27;s relationship to student performance, citing OECD PISA research establishing the correlation between autonomy and achievement. Proposes specific autonomy measures for schools (hiring staff, setting calendars, allocating budgets) and teachers (grading decisions), with analysis of PEI&#x27;s limited principal autonomy under provincial legislation and examples of innovative school models utilizing autonomy.</div>

<p><b>School Autonomy</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>Simply stated, there is a direct relationship between school performance and school autonomy.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In the words of the OECD Report, Pisa in Focus, 2011:</p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li6">“In countries where schools have greater autonomy over what is taught and how students<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
</ul>
<p>are assessed, students tend to perform better.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li6">In countries where schools account for their results by posting achievement data publicly, schools that enjoy greater autonomy in resource allocation tend to show better student performance than those with less autonomy.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li6">In countries where there are no such accountability arrangements, schools with greater autonomy in resource allocation tend to perform worse.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
</ul>
<p>In support of the concept</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Ideally, a school should have autonomy on how to resolve all learning matters as they pertain to students In practical terms, autonomy at the school level means giving each school the freedom to:</p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li6">recruit, hire, assign and supervise any and all instructional staff whether full-time, part time, teachers, teacher aides or volunteers</li>
  <li class="li6">Set their own calendar <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li6">Adjust the school day</li>
  <li class="li6">Allocate funds within a budget to reflect the needs and priorities of students and the community.</li>
  <li class="li6">decisions about curricula and assessment, course offerings and textbooks.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p>But autonomy and accountability needs to be shared with teachers as well.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Teachers should have freedom to:</p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li6">Make decisions as to how best serve each individual</li>
  <li class="li6">Assign grades at their sole discretion<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p>Students should have freedom to:</p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li6">Select any school; other Provinces allow it. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li6">Challenge any course for credit</li>
</ul>
<p>. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Part of the dilemma stems from the uncertainty as to the function of principal – a teacher or administrators.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The health field settled the question by<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Context of provincilpolicies</p>

<p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>To make the right decision for teir school</p>
<p>Work within budget and be accountable for results</p>
<p>All decisions about learners should be made at the level of the teacher</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>PEI principals</b></p>
<p>The role of school principals is described in The PEI Schools Act, however, the degree of freedom to act is not clear. It appears that their scope of practice is quite limited The following are clearly spelled out:</p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li10">educational leadership in the school,</li>
  <li class="li10">ensures that educational programs as described are carried out,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li10">Evaluation of teachers</li>
  <li class="li10">Maintain discipline</li>
  <li class="li10">Foster cooperation within the school</li>
  <li class="li10">Maintain order</li>
  <li class="li10">Consult teachers</li>
  <li class="li10">Attend to health, comfort and safety of students</li>
  <li class="li10">Carry out such other duties as the Superintendent, School Board or minister may assign</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>So what do schools do with their autonomy?</b></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li6"> Some schools continue as they always have.</li>
  <li class="li6">One school decided to do without a principal and hired an administrator instead, similar to some professional offices</li>
  <li class="li6">A school in Arizona<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>received agreement from the teachers union to convert seven teaching position to 14<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>teaching assistant positions thus dramatically increasing<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>the adult student ratio</li>
  <li class="li6">A high school introduced alternative approach to grouping students so that all students studied math<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>during the first period of the day, each in a class dealing with the mat needed</li>
  <li class="li6">Schools continued to operate on the traditional model</li>
  <li class="li6">One school hired an administrator instead principal</li>
  <li class="li6">Miniversity in Vancouver</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p>Benefits</p>
<p>Stronger links with community</p>
<p>Improve student results</p>
<p>Linkage to<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>to better educ</p>
<p>Conducive to student achievement positively in developed countries</p>
<p>What sort of autonomy would be supportive of education?</p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li6">All decisions about an individual student should be made by professional staff and at the school level</li>
  <li class="li6">Accountability for student learning</li>
  <li class="li6">Communicate regularly with local community</li>
  <li class="li6">Delegate to<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>lowest level</li>
  <li class="li6">Engage teachers in process</li>
