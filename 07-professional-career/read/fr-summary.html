  FR Summary
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">An October 2004 memo from Don to Ken Gillis on IAHSP fundraising strategy. Don reports picking up fundraising packages from Katy, reviewing progress, and noting activities were at a halt with time running short. He expresses confidence in reaching the $200,000 goal with extra effort but emphasizes Ken&#x27;s leadership role with key players, noting Katy is &quot;too new to the business&quot; to close deals. Don proposes a detailed five-part strategy including tidying up commitments, activating volunteers, organizing letter campaigns, and researching off-island foundations. The memo demonstrates Don&#x27;s strategic thinking, fundraising expertise, and collaborative leadership style.</div>

<p>Date:		October 27, 2004</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>To:		Ken Gillis</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>From:		Don Glendenning</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Subject:	IAHSP</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I finally am back to focusing on IAHSP and a few days ago picked up packages from Katy and started to make my calls and follow-ups.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Triggered in part by Harry’s call and our discussion, I spent most of Wednesday morning with Katy reviewing a range of IAHSP matters but I would like to focus this memo on Fund Raising.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Since talking with Katy, I reviewed the tracking list and progress to date.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>It appears that our FR activities were/are almost at a halt – and time is short.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Some notes are not dated and, therefore, I cannot tell just how much recent activity is taking place.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Having said that, however, I was more encouraged than I expected to be and I am confident that, with some extra effort, we could reach our $200,000 in the next few weeks.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I know from our recent conversation, Ken, that you are relying heavily on Katy to carry the bulk of the remaining fund raising.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Katy can play a role but the key to success, I believe, is your follow-up with key players and new contacts with a few others.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Katy can make some calls but is too new to the business and not well enough known by decision-makers to pull it off.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I know that this is a busy time for you with your civic responsibilities now compounded by family concerns in Cape Breton.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>To cut to the chase, here is a proposed strategy:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>You direct your efforts to tidying up two of the categories in Katy’s list – support promised no amount given and fall schedule</p>
<p>Katy activate Marion, Jeannette and I to do our follow-ups and finish our commitments.</p>
<p>Katy and I review, and likely add to, our list of individuals who deserve a visit and decide who can/will make the call.</p>
<p>Prepare for a letter writing campaign to folk who we will not visit but who, collectively, could put us over the top.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>With Ron Irving’s help, we could probably put a list together fairly quickly but Katy may need help to gather addresses.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We would not mail letters now but we could be ready for a mail out campaign say next spring.</p>
<p>Find a volunteer, Ron Irving (?), to lead us in our approach to off-Island foundations</p>
<p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Review our strategy for off-Island corporations.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>While all of these need to be done, I suggest that we concentrate on the first three; we have a 5-6 week window of opportunity.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I would thinj that 20 hours each for you and I and fewer hours for Marion and Jeannette should make a major difference in our situation.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It will be great to have the matter behind us.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Just some ideas for your consideration.</p>
<p><br></p>
