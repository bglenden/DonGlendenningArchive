  A Snow Job
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">An expanded version of the earlier &quot;Snow Job&quot; essay with refined arguments about school closures during winter weather. Don maintains his position that blanket closures undermine parental decision-making and accommodate institutional convenience over educational responsibility. The revised version emphasizes that school closures represent another instance of the education system removing decisions that should belong to parents. Don reiterates that students operate at varying levels and that schools must develop better skills at addressing individual differences. He notes that &quot;there is no such thing as group learning&quot; but individuals can learn in group settings. The piece concludes that administrative convenience should not drive educational policy and that teachers should develop capacity to manage disruptions caused by student absences due to weather.</div>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">When
I first moved to PEI, I lived directly across the street from a
Registered Nurse who worked, I was told, in the operating room of the
local hospital; about 6:00 am each morning, she would leave her house
and walk to the hospital in fair weather or foul.  About the same
time on stormy days, the local radio would announce school closings
because of snow, ice, or high winds.  Frequently, by 9:00 am the
storm would have subsided or not developed and traffic along our
street would be almost normal.  And shortly thereafter, children
would be building forts or tunnels, or pelting snowballs at passers
by.  
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Schools
closings are based on a concern for student comfort and safety; that
I understand.  There are days when it may not be safe for anyone to
be on the road except emergency vehicles.  And there are days when
some busses shouldn’t be on the road but other could be - but all
students do not arrive at school by bus.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Many
students walk to school, others are dropped off at school by parents;
some may even have their own vehicles while others may be transported
by parents even on fine days.  Why should schools be closed to
students w3ho are able to reach school?  My own children, for
example, walked to school and could have done so even on stormy most
days.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">In
closing schools, the education system is taking away (another)
decision that should, in my view, be made by parents.  A school
closing policy is not as simple as schools closing or staying open;
there are many interested parties and actual decision makers; each
has an interest in the issue.  To name a few:</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<ul>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
	Parents have the ultimate decision as to whether a child goes to
	school on any day – and that is as it should be.  That decision is
	based on a range of information including the child’s safety.  The
	fact that the day is stormy or that a bus is not operating is only
	part of the decision-making process – but it is a parent’s
	decision.  Even if the bus runs, a parent may make a decision not to
	send a child – and that is as it should be.</p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
	Bus drivers or their supervisors have a responsibility to authorize
	a bus to travel or not to travel; the reasons for not turning out
	are many and one is road and weather conditions; another could be a
	faulty bus.  There are days when individual school buses should not
	be on the road but I am not convinced that there are many days when
	all buses must be kept off Island roads.</p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
	There may be days when the facility itself should be closed because
	of such things as a broken water pipe, lack of power, a
	non-functioning furnace, etc. but weather would seldom be one of
	them.  I assume such decisions are taken by the school principal,
	but I am not sure.  School maintenance and support staff know the
	location of the school and know the unpredictability of PEI weather
	when they accept employment.  From time to time, an employee may not
	be able to reach the place of employment because of weather but it
	would be rare indeed if all staff were unable to be there.  Frequent
	inability to be at work would likely have consequences.</p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
	Teachers are expected to be in school each day and on arrival should
	find the facility to be open, comfortable and safe.  Knowing nearby
	students are expected to attend, demands that teachers also be
	present.  Officially closing a school, I am told, means that
	teachers get paid for that storm day.   If the school is open and a
	teacher does not attend, I am told, could result in the loss of a
	day’s pay.  While we need to be reasonable about anybody missing a
	day or part of a day under these circumstances, frequent absences,
	however, and should have consequences.</p></li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Any
time the topic of school closings arises it is accompanied by the
question of how to deal with students who do not make it to school
that day.  Well, how do you accommodate a student who is is sick for
a day or two?   The idea that all students are at the same level in
any or all subjects is a myth.  It is well known that students in the
same grade or class operate at a variety of levels.  My reading
suggests that some students may be a couple of grades ahead and
others a couple of grades behind in any subject – and those who are
ahead in one subject may be behind in another.    Teachers may
deliver the same lesson to a class but we are fooling ourselves if we
believe that all students receive and deal with it the same way.  So
how are these students accommodated?</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Schools
have to become more skillful at dealing with students as individuals.
 There is no such thing as group learning   Individuals may, however,
learn in a group setting.  Many schools find it difficult to
accommodate individual differences - but I will leave that issue for
another paper.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Closing
schools on stormy days is administratively convenient but I believe
is disruptive to students and learning.  The decision to attend or
not attend on any given day is that of a students or parent.  I
believe that teachers are quite able to deal with students in a much
disruptive way.</p>
