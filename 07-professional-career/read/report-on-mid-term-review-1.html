<p><span><b>Status of Mid Term Review</b></span></p>
<p><span><b>June 9, 2005</b></span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span><b>Program Background</b></span></p>
<p>The Community Foundation of P.E.I. (incorporated in 1993) brought the Island Arts &amp; Heritage Stabilization Program into being following four years of research and development. Executive Director (Katy Baker) began in September of 2003 and the process for the assessment and selection of participants was established. Six organizations were identified in the fall of 2004 and more will be finalized via the Outreach portion in June 2005. The sole purpose of the Program is to build stronger and more viable organizations for long term success in the non-profit arts and heritage community of PEI. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span><b>Background to Mid-term Review</b></span></p>
<p><span><b></b></span><br></p>
<p>In January of 2005 Don Glendenning, Board Member of the IAHSP, raised the matter of a Mid-Term Review of the project. A preliminary contact was made with a number of individuals and organizations, through a series of email and direct conversations, in order to flesh out the idea and explore any interest in undertaking such a review.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The matter of a ‘Mid Term Review’ was discussed at a Board meeting on February 25, 2005.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Minutes of the meeting state:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>“The Mid-term report was considered a good step although premature at this date – maybe in a few months from now when organizations have had more work done while in the program, possibly in May”.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The matter was discussed again at a Board meeting on April 21, 2005 and the minutes record the discussion as follows: <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>“Don talked about the mid-term report – after discussion on its needs and merits it was conclude such a review be a function of the Board in the manner of a self evaluation. Such a review would take place in a Board meeting designated exclusively for that topic. It was scheduled for May, 12, 9:00 am West Royalty.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Points to be discussed: the process, in general, of the Program; what other programs did to ‘self-evaluate’; the CH Stabilization Experience report; Doug’s mid-term proposal and Fund Raising”.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The Board met as planned and commenced the review process.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A summary of discussions follows:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
