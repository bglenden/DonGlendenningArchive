  AA-3 26-5 Interventions School autonomy
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Major policy document on school governance based on Don&#x27;s Indiana University assignment analyzing university governance through Kant&#x27;s philosophy. Defines governance as &quot;who makes what decisions, and in what manner.&quot; Highlights confusion between education and schooling, credentials vs. qualifications, and professional accountability. Presents a case from OECD research showing direct correlation between school autonomy and student performance. Proposes decision-making framework: learners/parents choose schools, teachers manage individual learners, principals lead instruction, trustees/superintendent operate schools, Deputy Minister ensures quality, Minister delegates operational roles. References Alberta school board decisions and proposes immediate PEI changes including consolidating educational responsibilities and delegating to lowest appropriate levels. Includes section on &quot;Thoughts on School Governance&quot; (May 25, 2012 draft) emphasizing freedom to teach with accountability to those served.</div>

<p>School Autonomy <br>
</p>
<p>My introduction to governance included the following assignment many years ago by Professor Gibson at Indiana University: "Propose a university governing structure based on the writings of Emmanuel Kant"<span>. </span>That project provided a foundation for my interest in the subject but also for a number of important turns in my educational career. These notes simply reflect that interest, my reading on the subject, and both my persona! experience and philosophy.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><b>Definition<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p>I like the definition of governance provided by <i>Governing America's Schools: Changing the Rules - <br>
</i>"governance is defined as who makes what decisions, and in what manner. In education, the 'who' is <br>
everybody from state legislators to parents. The 'what' covers everything from standards to parent <br>
involvement. The 'in what manner' or 'how' is everything from decisions made autonomously to those <br>
made within a framework established by others<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><b>Underlying issues<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p>In recent months, the writer has become aware of a some issues that contribute to the confusion about <br>
education and, therefore, about governance.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li7">Educators and the public alike use education and schooling interchangeably; the most frequent <br>
example, probably, is encompassed in the question "Where did you get your education?".<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
</ul>
<p>What the questioner really wants to know "Where did you go to school?" or even <i>11 </i>where did <br>
you get your degree?" One's education is the result of a broad range of learning experiences <br>
that may occur at home, at church, in the community at large, at school, through travel, in <br>
sports and recreation, etc. It really is the result of all one's formative experiences of which <br>
schooling is only a part. If we can differentiate hospital and health care, surely we can do the <br>
same for education and schooling. This view is reinforced by the fact that many Departments of <br>
Education are responsible for public schools only with adult and post secondary education in a <br>
different one. Even further evidence of the school-centeredness of Departments is the lack of <br>
initiatives focused on encouraging and recognizing independent learning.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><span>	</span>Q 	There is a similar confusion about credentials and qualifications. Credentials, more specifically, <br>
degrees and diplomas, are awarded by educational institutions and simply attest to the fact <br>
that a person has completed a program of studies as required by the institution determined by <br>
the institution. Qualifications, on the other hand, address the issue of performance and attest <br>
to what one can do with what one knows. Educators help people learn. While performing their <br>
job, they need to diagnose and assess performance for the purpose of improving instruction. <br>
Sorting learners, on the other hand, is not an educational function although uses many of the <br>
same techniques. Asking teachers to sort places them in a conflict of interest situation; it is <br>
learning that suffers. The issuance of qualifications requires a separate body<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li10">There appears to be a high level of public acceptance of low level essential skills of students <br>
from all levels of the education system. The reason is unclear. Perhaps, as suggested by a <br>
colleague, it is the result of there being only one provider. Neither the employer nor the public <br>
are especially happy with the produce but the have decided, perhaps by default, to live with it.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li11">Professionalism: what are the conditions, are teachers professional; does bureaucracy <br>
eliminate professionalism, ???<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Background<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p>To understand better the governance issue, I did a quick scan ofthe PEI School's Act and its various <br>
regulations, as well as the teacher's collective agreement; it left me confused. I was looking for an <br>
understanding of the decisions that can be made by a teacher, a principal, a trustee, or any other <br>
decision-maker, especially decisions about learners that can be made without having to check with a <br>
higher level of authority. I did not find an answer, although I am sure it exists if I knew where to look. <br>
My conclusion, although perhaps an unfair one, is that there are few, if any, decisions that fall clearly to <br>
one position and one position alone. Report card comments, I am told, must be vetted by the principal.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>A test of good governance would likely include the following criteria:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li10">Well defined descriptions of roles and responsibilities<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li10">Measurable accountabilities<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li10">Transparent decision making process<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li10">A healthy measure of public engagement<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li10">Short communication lines between the governors and the governed<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
</ul>
<p>The most telling document however, was a 2011 report from the OECD that shows a direct link between <br>
PISA test results and school autonomy. Autonomy, or freedom to act, varies from country to country <br>
but may include such things as allocation of resources, hiring and dismissing teachers, formulating <br>
budgets, decisions about curricula and assessment, course offerings and textbooks. Simply stated, <br>
there is a direct relationship between school performance and school autonomy. In the words of the <br>
DECD Report:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li16">"In countries where schools have greater autonomy over what is taught and how students <br>
are assessed, students tend to perform better.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li17">In countries where schools account for their results by posting achievement data publicly, <br>
schools that enjoy greater autonomy in resource allocation tend to show better student <br>
performance than those with less autonomy.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>	</span>11 	In countries where there are no such accountability arrangements, schools with greater <br>
autonomy in resource allocation tend to perform worse."<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><b>Decision making levels in the Current System<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p>It is interesting to compare access by individuals to government funded professional human services; in <br>
this case, I looked at health and justice. In the latter cases, access to "help" is direct and personal; <br>
desired and needed services are personalized, delivered directly by a professional who takes the "case". <br>
The professional becomes an advocate and advisor until the objective is reached. In education, however, <br>
one is struck by the lack of focused personal attention and the required administrative approvals for <br>
what I believe are professional matters.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The writer proposes that decision-making be assigned as follows:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>•	Learner/parent - selection of school and program<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>•	Teacher - need for each learner to have a teacher who serves the same role as a family doctor <br>
for one's health and is accountable for all professional decisions for learners under his or her <br>
care.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>•	Principal- it is unlikely that the role of principal as instructional leader and school administrator <br>
can be successfully combined; my perception is that the role of instructional leader is most likely <br>
the one to be neglected.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>•	Trustees and Superintendent - operate schools<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>•	Deputy Minister - divest operational responsibilities and concentrate on ensuring quality <br>
education for every Islander, not just those in schools.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>•	Minister - relinquish role in relation to an individual learner, teacher or parent.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p>Thoughts on School Governance</p>
<p><b>Lens:</b> 	Standards should be set by Department of Education; freedom devolved to individual teachers to determine what, when, where and how to teach; full accountability to teachers for student learning, increased reliance on market forces to maintain/improve quality. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><b>Outline</b></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li28">A school governance model by itself will do little, if anything, but<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>improve the education but redesigning the role could make a change enabler.</li>
  <li class="li28">Current delivery model is not supportive of current educational thinking</li>
  <li class="li28">Need to start with clearly stated views as to the nature of education and the role of schools</li>
  <li class="li28">The role of Government is to exercise leadership, plan, set standards, certify teachers, fund, monitor, set policies</li>
  <li class="li28">The key to a quality education is a system which provides teachers with the professional freedom to teach and a direct accountability to those they serve.</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Background</b></p>
<p>The Government of Prince Edward Island has decided to change from two English school Boards to one.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>While I am sure that there are good reasons for the change, such a change by itself will do little, if anything, to improve the quality of education delivered to our youth.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>On the other hand, changing the model couldremove barriers to change, increase the chances of change or even reward change makers.</p>
<p>While not an expert on governance, it is a subject in which the writer has considerable interest and some experience.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In fact, it was a governance issue that led the writer, in 1969. to accept an offer from PEI rather than another jurisdiction.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Also, in 1969 the writer, as a member of the College Planning Committee, was intimately involved in deciding on the Governance model for Holland College and directly impacted by the result - a unicameral Board of Governors.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That decision, I believe, played a significant role in allowing Holland College to become the institution it is today.</p>
<p>Given the considerable level of comment and concern about public education, the decision by the Government of Prince Edward Island to establish a single Board of school trustees for the Island, this paper is put forth as an instrument to increase the level of public debate.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The writer realizes that there is not a single proven model for all situations, neither will PEI’s decision settle the matter forever; the school system surely must realize that, whatever the decision, it is a temporary one and prepare themselves for more changes to follow.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The tensions created during a change process are healthy ones; all we can hope is that changes lead to improvement and provide a platform<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>for changes yet unforeseen.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Education</b></p>
<p>One’s views on a subject reflect ones beliefs.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is the writer’s view that:</p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li28">Education is the most important issue in shaping our futures as individuals, as a community and as a nation.</li>
  <li class="li28">Departments of Education in Canada could be more accurately named Departments of Schooling, or perhaps, Departments of Public Instruction</li>
  <li class="li28">Government has a major role to play in assuring that every Islander has access to a quality education.</li>
  <li class="li28">Government should not be running schools; instruction should be left to the professionals.</li>
  <li class="li28">The role of Government is to exercise leadership, plan, set standards, certify teachers, fund, monitor, set policies but not run schoops.</li>
</ul>
<p>As for governance:</p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li28">There is a direct relationship between school performance and school autonomy<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li28">Delegate to the lowest level possible but hold each person accountable for results.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Role of a Board of School Trustees</b></p>
<p>Accountability,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>responsibilities -- the ability or authority to act or decide on one's own, without supervision</p>
<p>, duties – often confused</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>In leadership roles,<sup>[2]</sup> accountability is the acknowledgment and assumption of responsibility for actions, products, decisions, and policies including the administration, governance, and implementation within the scope of the role or employment position and encompassing the obligation to report, explain and be</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>In practical terms, this means giving each principal the freedom to:</p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li28">recruit, hire, assign and supervise any and all instructional staff whether full-time, part time, teachers, teacher aides or volunteers, even to set their own calendar <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li28">Allocate funds within a budget to reflect the needs and priorities of students and the community he/she serves.</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p>Teachers should have freedom to:</p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li28">Make decisions as to how best serve each individual</li>
  <li class="li28">Assign grades at their sole discretion<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p>Students should have freedom to:</p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li28">Select any school; other Provinces allow it. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li28">Challenge any course for credit</li>
</ul>
