<p>DACUM Analysis - Information for Panel Members</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>What we will do:</b></p>
<p>We will follow a structured, proven process to analyse your occupation. This will then be produced as a chart. The chart is an organized, accurate, current description of your occupation as it is now and will be in the foreseeable future.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I will orient you thoroughly at the beginning of the session. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>What is DACUM?</b></p>
<p>We will use the DACUM process, invented in Canada in 1960 and now used around the world.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>A DACUM Analysis is a cost-effective, highly valid and dynamic process of identifying what practitioners do. It uses experts from the occupation to identify the competencies required to perform the job. Although DACUM stands for Developing a Curriculum, it has a wide variety of uses: training needs assessment; program development / review / revision; job description; job modification; occupational performance standards; employee recruitment; career planning; skill achievement record, etc.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>What to bring:</b></p>
<p>Please bring a willingness to participate and a writing instrument. You will not need any documentation or electronic access.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Roles:</b></p>
<p>You are the expert panel, and I am your facilitator. You know your work; I’m the process person.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>What to expect:</b></p>
<p>Being a member of a DACUM panel can be both really easy and really difficult! I’ll be asking you what you do, in detail. Your panel will reach consensus about the activities you do and will be doing in the foreseeable future.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>You do not need to know anything other than what you do and expect to do at work. It does not matter if you have been doing this work for 20 years or 1 year, your input is equally valid.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>You will be thinking and expressing your thoughts, not writing. I will input the group decisions.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Most persons who participate find it to be a satisfying process.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>What helps:</b></p>
<p>It’s very helpful if you can participate fully – please say what you think!<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>It takes quite a bit of effort and concentration to complete the process, so please extricate yourselves from all of your other responsibilities during the scheduled sessions, if at all possible.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Looking forward to working with you,</p>
<p><br></p>
