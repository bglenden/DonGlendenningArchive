<p>Some time ago, I wrote to you, or your organization, exploring your interest in some follow-up to the IAHSP program.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>At that time, I was thinking of a possible workshop.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>There did not seem to be much interest, however, Scott MacAuley proposed, instead of a workshop, that the initial six organizations in the IAHSP program could benefit from a promotional brochure.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In Scott’s words “<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><i>“One thing I suggested at a previous workshop was for IAHSP Program organizations to come together in producing a pamphlet that would be circulated in the waiting areas and offices of Allied Professionals(doctors, lawyers, accountants, financial planners).</i></p>
<p><i> </i></p>
<p><i>The pamphlet might be called…Leave An Artistic Legacy...and each organization would have their own dedicated panel describing their mission, reason for being, registered charitable number(if any) board members, web site, etc.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></i></p>
<p><i> </i></p>
<p><i>This document would plant the seed in readers to consider leaving a legacy in their wills, through life insurance policies, stocks or properties etc. during their lives or in their estates.</i></p>
<p><i> </i></p>
<p><i>The Community Foundation could be the catalyst bringing all of these independent groups under one umbrella or assist in marketing the organizations as separate Independent entities.”</i></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Please let me know if you are interested and, if so, the Foundation will take steps to move the idea forward.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I would appreciate a prompt reply.</p>
