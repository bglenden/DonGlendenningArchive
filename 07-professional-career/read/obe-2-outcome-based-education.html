<p>In Spady’s words: “Outcome-Based Education means clearly focusing and organizing everything in</p>
<p>an educational system around what is essential for all students to be able to do successfully at the</p>

<p>In Spady’s words: “Outcome-Based Education means clearly focusing and organizing everything in</p>
<p>an educational system around what is essential for all students to be able to do successfully at the</p>
<p>end of their learning experiences. This means starting with a clear picture of what is important for</p>
<p>students to be able to do, then organizing the curriculum, instruction, and assessment to make sure</p>
<p>this learning ultimately happens” (Spady, 1994:1). Such an approach presupposes that someone can</p>
<p>determine what things are “essential for all students to be able to do”, and that it is possible to</p>
<p>achieve these things through an appropriate organisation of the education system and through</p>
<p>appropriate classroom practices</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>From his three premises, Spady developed four essential principles of OBE.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li6"><b><i>Clarity of focus</i></b>: this means that everything teachers do must be clearly focused on what they</li>
  <li class="li6"><b><i>Designing back </i></b>and it is inextricably linked to the</li>
  <li class="li6"> teachers should have <b><i>high expectations </i></b>for all students.</li>
  <li class="li6">that teachers must strive to</li>
