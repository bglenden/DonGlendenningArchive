  Issues in Secondary Education
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Don convened colleagues in 1991 to identify critical secondary education issues. The group recognized education as vital to economic prosperity, human development, and international competitiveness. Don identifies critical issues: computer technology implementation, teacher role transformation, accountability systems, educational leadership, serving disadvantaged students, and inter-level coordination. Recommended demonstration projects include developing lifetime achievement records, improving communication skills, establishing open learning systems, challenging credits, autonomous agencies for 15+ students without certificates, and comparative teacher studies. Co-authored by Hall, Thomas, Glendenning, Baker, and Malmberg.</div>

<p><b>18 - Critical Issues in Secondary Education</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>During the summer of 1991, I convened a meeting of colleagues to identify some of the critical issues in secondary education*. ~e of the ideas that follow were drawn from that discussion; others have been added. """'\</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>As background, we shared the view that:</p>
<p>· our economic prosperity would be determined in large measure by the degree to which our educational system develops the nation's human resources, · knowledge is a key factor in~ country's international strength · Secondary schools are key players in the development of heman resources · There is a need for flexibility of mind-set of individuals and organizations · There will be a need for greater analytical, problem-solving,communicatikon and interpersonal skills on the part of workers · Further study is needed on graduation requyirements, systems of grading, and promotion · Reducing grades due to lost days and the replacement with current graduation requirements with competencies.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>'1</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The paper identifies the following critical issues · Application of computer technology beyond administration and into the realm of being a resource available to all learners · Education of teachers must change to reflect the changing role from that of prime source of information to a manager of learning · Accountability to bring congruence between learner objectives and evaluation, to ensure that graduation requirements are relevant and meaningful, for service to all youth not just those who are university or college bound, · Leadership because school leaders articulate the school vision, shapes a climate which fosters learning, orchestrates a curriculum changes and innovations, and are the driving force within the school.</p>
<p>· Poorly served st;udents whether they be gifted, challenged, come from a minority, immigrants, in conflict with the law.</p>
<p>· Linkage and coordination between levels of government, in the sharing of resources among schools, between secondary schools and universities, between secondary school and employers, and between school and the home.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The original recommended a number [possible demonstration projects including: · Develop and provide eache learner with a lifelong record of achiemvement in cognitive, psychomotor and affective domains.</p>
<p>· Emphasize and study approaches to improving commun ication skills of all students.</p>
<p>· Identify criteria which distinguish a high school graduate from a person who has not graduated,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>· Develop an open learning system which allows any learner to challenge for any credit at any level within the system, · Develop a program planning model which starts with learning objectives and ends with evaluation criteria, · Establish an autominous agency to coordinate the trai;ning of 15 year plus students who have left the system without a school certificate · Undertake a comparative study of teachers who enter taeaching as mature students as compared wi;th steachers who move directly from secondary school through university into teaching.</p>
