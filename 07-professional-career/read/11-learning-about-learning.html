  11 Learning About Learning
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Don reflects on his teaching journey, commencing at age 17 at Teacher&#x27;s College Fredericton, then teaching rural one-room schools and secondary/post-secondary levels. He laments insufficient focus on the teaching-learning process during his training and advocates every school should publish a learning model focused on learner activities (not teacher activities). He provides a practical exercise: sketch steps from course entry to exit, sequence them, identify optional paths, and ask how you know the sequence is correct. Don emphasizes that developing a learning model takes minutes initially but lifetimes to perfect—and wishes he&#x27;d developed one before his teaching career.</div>

<p><b>Learning About Learning</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>In preparation for a teaching career, at age 17, I attended Teacher’s College in Fredericton, N.B.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Given the need for teachers, the Province then enrolled students twice a year for a six months training program.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>While still only seventeen, I commenced teaching in a one-room rural school.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was an experience I will never forget.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The students and I survived; whether they learned is another matter.</p>
<p>The years which followed were filled with teaching and summer school as I went on to complete the requirements for a teacher’s license.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>During that period, also, my teaching career included experience at both the secondary and post-secondary levels.</p>
<p>I still recall, at least some of the information and instruction received in Teacher’s College about developing lesson plans, using audio visual aids, maintaining the school register, school law, psychology, teaching methods, etc.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But I do not recall much about the teaching-learning process.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This process has since become an interest of mine and is the subject of this column.</p>
<p>The heart of schooling is, or should be, the teaching-learning process.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We should spend much more time learning and thinking about it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It provides a framework for the teaching we do; it provides a framework for our decisions as teachers.</p>
<p>In our study of the teaching learning process we need to consider the teacher, the learner and the process.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Our starting point should be the learner.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If we get the learner’s role and activities right, the rest will follow.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Organizational theory suggests that every organization needs a mission statement and it should be published.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The process of developing a mission statement is important for an organization and is usually highly consultative.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Many organizations have such a statement prominently displayed throughout their premises.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Schools, colleges and universities should have them too.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>So should training departments.</p>
<p>Even more important for training and education organizations is to have a published learning model.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This should focus on what the learner does.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>What the teacher/trainer does is a separate matter.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Having a learning model in place does not guarantee anything except that someone in the organization has consciously thought about an appropriate learning model for your organization.</p>
<p>Does your school have published learning model?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If so, you are in the minority.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If not, why not?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I’ve visited many schools in my day but seldom have I been shown one.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Yet, in my view, it is one of the first things that should be established.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It should be part of both the program planning and teacher education process.</p>
<p>Your learning model may apply to a course or to an entire program and it should allow for both full-time and part-time learners.</p>
<p>If your school does not have a published learning model, reach for a piece of paper and let’s sketch one. DO IT NOW.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It only takes a few minutes to draft the first one; it will take a lifetime to perfect it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I suggest that you draw the “ideal” model – the one towards which you strive rather than your existing one.</p>
<p>On the left hand side make a small box and insert the words "Student registers for class”.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>On the right side of the paper, draw another box and print the words “Student exits class”.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Now plot the steps in between.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Include all the steps and show ones which are required as well as those which are optional.</p>
<p>Your list of steps will probably include such steps as student reviews course objectives, takes tests, prepares course papers, participates in class discussions, performs laboratory experiments, completes work placement, takes final examination, exits course without completion, receives course credit, etc.</p>
<p>Now put the steps in sequence.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Which steps must be taken first?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Which ones can be skipped?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Draw arrows showing the alternative paths between entering and leaving a course.</p>
<p>As you list the steps, ask yourself the following questions:</p>
<p>What steps does/should a student take?</p>
<p>In what sequence should they be?</p>
<p>How do I know?</p>
<p>Answer as thoughtfully and honestly as you can.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Answering the last question may take you back to your textbooks and to recent educational and training journals.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Your model will likely be revised as your knowledge and experience grows.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I change mine regularly.</p>
<p>Even though I no longer teach, I am still interested in the activities and the sequences of a learning model.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Perhaps my students would have fared better had I thought more about learning during my preparation for teaching.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>For those who are still active in education and training, it is still not too late.</p>
