<p><b>Needed: An Atlantic Qualification Authority</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>Sometimes we need a piece of paper to prove what we’ve learned; this represents a sea change from the days when credentials, a high school diploma or college degree, would open most any door.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But diplomas and degrees are not enough, anymore, employers want evidence as to what a person can do with what he/she knows.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Welcome to the world of qualifications.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>There’s some confusion as to the difference between qualifications and credentials.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My definitions are simple.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Degrees and diplomas are credentials; they tell what and where a person has studied.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A qualification, on the other hand, certifies that a person has the attitudes, skills and knowledge required to perform a role or a task.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Most countries have qualification authorities, except Canada and the US, that is; it’s probably because we don’t have a National Education Department.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I’m most familiar with the one in New Zealand which regulates the nature and quality of courses offered at both the secondary and postsecondary level.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>a person has stud degrees aIt’s true the world has changed; we must think globally even when planning locally. We are linked through investment, transportation systems, banking regulations, international agreements travel and instant communication.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Knowledge industries have exploded but the knowledge on which they are based is available at the end if the arm. Manipulation of information is the cutting edge. The importance of the omportance of the information deliverer has declined</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Education is trapped by the cloak of its own success.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>What it became good at yesterday is impeding its progress today.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Our post war expansopn was led by skilled people from western Europe</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Education</p>
<p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Still content oriented</p>
<p>Time based</p>
<p>Havent risen beyond credentials</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>What can/ should we do</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>chool achievement levels are established during the curriculum development process by curriculum developers in consultation with teachers and education specialists and fitted into grade levels the grade level structure.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Assessment and evaluation measures the extent to which individual students meet or surpass expectations for the subject and grade.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>In practice:</p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li4">Using the same word, Grade, for two purposes is confusing and the results are misleading.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li4">The issue is further complicated by outcomes based curriculum development and delivery, but not adopting externally referenced criteria for assessment and grading. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li4">Spreading the authority to grant grades to all who teach exacerbates the matter of consistency of achievement levels throughout a province</li>
  <li class="li4">While formative testing is part of the teaching process, summative teaching is not.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p>As a result, interpreting what has been learned is often unfair to students and unclear to HR staff, admission offices and qualification bodies with a major headache.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li4"><b>Higher education initiatives:</b><span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></li>
</ul>
<p>The project is being designed to provide university and college admission officer, HR personnel and others who need to know, with reliable and consistent information about achievement levels of applicants so that they, in turn, can make better decisions about the students they accept.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Employers, postsecondary institutions and qualification bodies ask for “graduation” as a basic entrance requirement and then try to figure out just what that means on their system.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As a result, many college and university students struggle with course work and, it is felt, practice of accepting less than asked lowers the achievement level of college graduates and professionals in later life.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As well, postsecondary dollars are being used for non- postsecondary purposes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We want to remove the inconsistencies currently found in that term; of Education, it is an accepted fact that posted requirements may be significantly shaded first by the culture of the school providing the grade and secondly by the “shading” applied during the selection process.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li4"><b>Disadvantaged or vulnerable youth</b>: Securing a recognized proficiency level should help addresses the issue of basic skills, those skills needed to gain entry to the next phase of life and, without which many are branded as failures.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We are aware that sometimes this may result from poor decisions by<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>students<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>themselves; on the other hand, we are also aware that the gap may from incorrect information, biased counselling, streaming, outdated course content, poor teaching, inflexible scheduling, lack of encouragement and mentoring, and the list goes on</li>

<p><b>PROJECT NARRATIVE</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>Following the publication of a survey of Island youth in late 2013 (CFPEI, <span>Vital Signs</span>, 2013), Education 20/20 organized six public discussions for the purpose of informing the community of the report and its findings, learning more about youth issues in our communities, exploring issues of education and learning, and to identify actions to be taken to close gaps.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Discussions were lively and wide ranging, and carried on well after the formal session ended. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The final report included a recommendation that.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b><i>Further study be undertaken to clarify the gaps in preparation for further study and for work</i></b></p>
<p><b><i>-(Preparedness, Education 20/20 Inc., Occasional Paper No. 1</i></b></p>
<p>Since then Education 20/20 has continued its exploration, both formally and informally, with postsecondary institutions, employers, teachers and education officials and concluded that:</p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li6">The use of “Grade” to designate both age level and achievement level is confusing; we recommend that “<b>Grade</b>” continue to be used for this purpose.</li>
  <li class="li6">A separate classification (we recommend “<b>Level</b>”) be used to denote achievement level in a subject.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li6">The adoption of Curriculum Based Outcomes demands a review of achievement levels.</li>
  <li class="li6">Mathematics be chosen for the pilot project<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li6">An independent body is needed to conduct assessment for the purpose of assigning levels of achievement.</li>
  <li class="li6">Traditional assessment practices are no longer suitable</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p>Weaknesses of the current system include:</p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li4">The sheer number of institutions with authority to grant grades.</li>
  <li class="li4">Inherent conflict when those who teach also grade</li>
  <li class="li4">Different approaches to curriculum development</li>
  <li class="li4">Confusion arising from the use of “Grade” to both classify the age of the learner and as a level of achievement</li>
</ul>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li4">Growing use of social promotion</li>
  <li class="li4">Changing style of student reporting</li>
  <li class="li4">Lack of benchmarks<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Proposal </b>– as a pilot project and using mathematics as a vehicle, develop/test a model for establishing outcome-based achievement</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Steps:</b></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li4"><b>Establish Steering Committee –</b>to be chaired by President of Education 20/20 Inc. and include but not limited to educators,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>employers, public at large and the Community Foundation.</li>
  <li class="li4"><b>Gather background information - l</b>ocal institutions, Western and Northern Canada Protocol that provides math curriculum to most Provinces, Ontario Qualification Framework, Qualification Authorities (Australia and New Zealand), PISA, P-CAP,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li4"><b>Secure<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span></b>working list of outcomes or competencies<b> </b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li4"><b>Develop or adopt a rating scale;</b></li>
</ul>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li4">Criterion referenced</li>
  <li class="li4">Reflective of Bloom’s taxonomy</li>
</ul>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li4"><b>Prepare final report</b></li>
  <li class="li4"><b>Implement – </b>work with institutions and employers to implement</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Innovative and beneficial features:</b></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li4">A single analysis of a subject available to all educational institutions<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li4">Provides the same view of the subject for all users, teachers, students, parents, examiners, employers and parents.</li>
  <li class="li4">Improves capability for tracking student learning</li>
  <li class="li4">Allows for identification of a variety of profiles drawn from the same analysis<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li4">Supports independent study</li>
  <li class="li4">Bridges institutional and employer needs</li>
  <li class="li4">Encourages communication and teamwork<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li4">Allows learners to situate their learning in the context of the larger field<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Not surprising, people often confuse credentials and qualifications.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Diplomas and degrees are credentials and are awarded by institutions to people who have successfully completed a program or course of studies. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Credentialling criteria are mostly knowledge based and are heavy on input measures, time, content studied, qualification of teachers; they also emphasize what has been studied rather than what has been learned.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The reliability of credentials is limited, however, due to the large number of issuing organizations , reliance on teacher judgement and conflicting school policies such as social promotion.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A qualification, on the other hand, is an actual measure of what the holder can do with what he or she knows.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As an example, apprentices may take their formal training<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>in high schools, colleges, industrial training programs or even the armed forces.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Training is based on a common occupational analysis, agreed stages, on-job training and common exams, common analyses, both provincial and national examinations and an endorsement known as the Red Seal.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Other Canadian examples of the separation of credentialing and qualification include the work of the Royal Canadian Conservatory of Music, Canadian Red Cross, Canadian Swimming.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Education 20/20 Inc. supports<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>the establishment of a Canadian qualification framework and an independent body to run it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Such an authority would assess and certify a person’s level of performance on a task or set of tasks such as found in an occupation or field of study. For example, a qualifications authority would assume the grading function now handled by teachers but not the formative or dfiagnostic function. The qualifications authority would focus certification clearly on performance that matters support lifelong learning, and self-directed study and thereby allow schools to focus on formative assessment practices that serve to help students learn. A qualification authority would, in effect, serve two clients, organizations (i.e., employers) desiring an assessment of prospective employees and individuals wanting to establish the level and suitability of their qualifications. While qualification authorities we are familiar with, focus on approving courses, accrediting institutions, and analyzing current offerings; we believe in a qualification authority that assesses individuals directly, not one that massages the minutiae of hours, outcomes, teacher qualification of education providers. A qualification authority could also play a useful role in helping people identify gaps in their preparation for a given field of work. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Education 20/20 Inc. supports a qualification authority that is independent with its own governing structure, accepts clients on direct application or by referral and issues certificates as appropriate based on demonstrated performance. Additionally, the authority could (on request) provide applicants with information on learning gaps in certification requirements. A qualification authority would not, however, organize competitions, rank students, or grant credentials. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>A review of the literature supports the value of a qualification framework. Benefits include easing the assessment burden on teachers and the school system, improving the consistency in reporting, serve as a n agency to evaluate foreign credentials, easing the mobility process, improving communications between and among education stakeholders, encouraging self- study and reducing the incidence of grade inflation.</p>
