  Hall Stavert Potential Fund
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Formal letter from Don Glendenning (signed &quot;D. Glendenning, C.M.&quot; - noting his Order of Canada designation) proposing the establishment of a Hall and Stavert Family Fund to commemorate the historic manufacturing, agriculture, and fishing company&#x27;s legacy on PEI. Don suggests the fund serve triple purposes: reflecting family ideals, perpetuating the company name, and honoring employees&#x27; contributions. Proposes annual awards options including scholarships in mechanical engineering/design, innovation leadership awards, or public lectures on design and marketing. The letter demonstrates Don&#x27;s historical awareness and ability to connect heritage preservation with contemporary philanthropic giving.</div>

<p>Jim Stavert and Tom Hall</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Dear Jim and Tom,</p>
<p>With the long history that Hall and Stavert has on Prince Edward Island, it seems fitting that the name<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>be recognized in a tangible way.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Though the firm, Hall and Stavert, is no longer active on Prince Edward Island, their contributions to the manufacturing, agriculture and fishing industries were innovative, substantial widely recognized.</p>
<p>Given the partnership and your interest in PEI history, we present an idea for your consideration.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We propose the establishment of a Hall and Stavert Fund with the Community Foundation of Prince Edward Island to remember the name in perpetuity and to make an annual award to some worthy cause. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The purpose of the fund would be threefold, to reflect the ideals and values of the Hall and Stavert families, to commemorate the Hall and Stavert name on Prince Edward Island, to honour Hall and Stavert employees for their contributions to the company, and to<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>make an annual award for some worthy cause.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>To spark the discussion about an appropriate annual award, let me present the fllowing ideas for your consideration:</p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li2">A scholarship for an Island student either entering college or<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>university or proceeding to advanced study in mechanical engineering, manufacturing or design;</li>
  <li class="li2">An innovation or leadership award to an individual or company reflecting the Hall and Stavert history<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li2">An annual public lecture on design, innovation or marketing of Island products.</li>
</ul>
<p>I would be delighted to pursue these and other<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>ideas with you and will contact you shortly to set up a mutually convenient time. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>I hope you and your families are enjoying our Island summer and the many activities that it brings.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>D. Glendenning, C.M.</p>
<p>Director</p>
