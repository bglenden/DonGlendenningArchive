  Skopeck letter--Rev Smith
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Don&#x27;s October 4, 2012 letter to Lorraine Slopek requesting biographical information on Rev. Smith &quot;who served as Minister at St. John the Evangelist Church in Bay du Vin, New Brunswick between 1937 and 1940.&quot; Don describes Smith&#x27;s recognition of limited secondary education access, his rectory classes, hiring of teachers, and the resulting 1939 provincial approval for MRHS as &quot;the first of a series of rural high schools throughout the Province.&quot; Don mentions the scholarship committee&#x27;s ongoing efforts and requests additional biographical information. The letter exemplifies Don&#x27;s role as institutional historian and his continued involvement with the scholarship fund decades after his own MRHS graduation.</div>

<p>Hello, Don,</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I have very little information about Rev. Smith, except that he came to this diocese in 1940 and left in 1948 to go to Montreal.</p>
<p>He was ordained Deacon in 1936, and ordained Priest in 1938 both by the Bishop in the Diocese of Fredericton -- before he came here.</p>
<p>He seems to have been active in the Parish of Christ Church, Windsor, NS, in the early 1940s, having received a B.A. at King’s College in 1934, which was then located in Windsor, (unless there is also a King’s College in Fredericton --I assume there isn’t).</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>But he is noted in our Synod Journals as being “on leave” from 1945 onwards.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>To find out more about his early life you would have to contact the <span><b>Archives of the Diocese of Fredericton</b></span>:</p>

<b>Subject:</b> Rev. Harvey Douglas Smith</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I am seeking information about Rev. Harvey Douglas Smith, who served as Minister at St. John the Evangelist Church in Bay du Vin, New Brunswick between 1937 and 1940.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Shortly after his arrival, he became aware of and concerned about the small number of local youth proceeding into secondary education. As a result, he commenced classes for local youth in the Rectory. With support from some local citizens, he was able to hire an instructor or two and increase both the number served and grade levels offered. By 1939, Rev. Smith and community leaders convinced the Provincial Government to build a the Miramichi Rural High School – the first of a series of rural high schools throughout the Province.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>A number of years ago the local community established a Scholarship in his name to recognize his pioneering work and to assist young people of the area in their postsecondary studies. The Scholarship Committee is seeking to increase the amount available for scholarships. I volunteered to see if I could learn anything further about Rev. Smith. Any additional information that you can provide will be much appreciated.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Thanks in advance for your help</p>
<p><br></p>
