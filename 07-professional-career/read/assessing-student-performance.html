  Assessing Student Performance
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">A reflective account of Holland College&#x27;s innovative STEP (Systematic Training and Education Program) approach to student performance assessment. Don credits Robert Adams of Nova Scotia NewStart Corporation with developing the DACUM-based performance rating scale, distinguishing it from traditional school evaluation. The essay outlines seven principles of expert supervisory judgment that informed DACUM development: supervisors sense satisfaction through simultaneous factors; they assess by observation and subjective judgment; competent supervisors recognize good work; they avoid single-instance judgments; they base recognition on demonstrated performance, not knowledge; they observe problem-solving processes; and they don&#x27;t require rigid criteria. Don describes Holland College&#x27;s implementation: learners self-rate upon entry and throughout, engage in learning plans with instructors, receive confirmation ratings, and understand greatest learning occurs when ratings change. He credits instructors&#x27; occupational backgrounds for understanding this performance-based approach, establishing a best practice for competency-based training.</div>

<p><b>Assessing Student Performance</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Perhaps the most unique aspect of the STEP approach was how student’s performance was rated; it was truly performance based.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>No other educational institution that I know had implemented a performance based rating scale and, based on a survey of private industry, industrial based training programs do not use competency based rating either.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Along with the DACUM analysis, Holland College adopted and later modified the DACUM rating scale.</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Traditionally, school evaluation systems relate only to the acquisition of knowledge in a school setting.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Performance based rating is different; it is based in the reality of the real life work situation where application of knowledge, or performance, is the rule.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The criteria and levels of learner performance are the same as, or at least reflect, those of the workplace.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Learning is measured by observable behaviour of the kind that an immediate supervisor would recognize in a work situation.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The evaluation process is simple, clear, easily understood by both employer and employee alike and is directly applicable to trainees preparing to work in an occupation or field.</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Robert Adams of Nova Scotia NewStart corporation, the primary architect of the DACUM system, developed a performance based rating scale based on the view that:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>1.	Supervisors are able to sense their satisfaction or dissatisfaction with a task being performed. A number of factors may be combined simultaneously, such as speed with which a task is performed, the quality of the work that is visible, and the usefulness of the product being built, yet the good supervisor is able to make judgments about his satisfaction with performance involving a number of such assessment factors.</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>2.	Supervisors assess performance by observation, followed by a rather subjective expert decision or judgment. They seldom administer tests, and, in other than in the most simple or repetitive jobs, they seldom have an opportunity to measure performance in terms of production or quality of product.</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>3.	The occupationally competent supervisor can tell when a good job is being done while he observes and monitors work.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In other words, he can tell a good job when he sees it.</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>4.	The good supervisor typically avoids making judgments about performance on the basis of isolated instances.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He has to be shown that the individual can apply his skills in a variety of situations before that performance is satisfactory.</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>5.	While he professes otherwise during curriculum meetings, the good supervisor seldom makes judgments about ability on the basis of employee's knowledge.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Again, he has to be shown that the individual is capable of performing and achieving before he will grant recognition.</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>6.	The technically competent supervisor is able to observe and assess mental problem-solving skill performance not observable by those not expert in the occupation.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He can detect whether or not, or how well, an employee is applying design or problem-solving thought process that are not directly observable in action or not directly visible in the end product.</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>7.	The occupationally competent supervisor does not need rigid performance criteria to assess adequacy of performance.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Adequacy is exhibited in the speed and quality of application of skill and the results of the work.</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>8.	The good supervisor appreciates the fact that most rigid criteria developed for training programs are not really part of the job.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>For example, few executives are concerned about the typing speed of their secretaries.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They know when they are satisfied with the speed of production of a memo, a formal letter, or a project proposal or brief.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They are little concerned about whether the secretary can type at 60 or 80 words a minute.</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>9.	Most supervisors readily express their concern about educational-type measurement and entry qualifications.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They recognize that there are some persons who are not able to qualify for entry to the occupation but who perform reasonably well on the job once they are able to gain entry.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They realize, too, that there are persons who more than qualify but who do not seem to be able to produce or fill job requirements."</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Since our instructors came directly from the occupational field to Holland College, and many had held supervisory roles, they had a basic understanding of and feel for the performance based rating scale.</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Assessment of performance occurred:</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>On entry to a program, each learner reviewed the skills on an appropriate DACUM chart and noted, ticked of but preferably gave himself/herself an entry rating.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This action ensured that learners looked over the program which they had chosen, gained some insight into what would be learned and identified some of the skills they could already perform at some level.</b></p>
<p><b>Following this initial review, a learning plan was agreed to between learner and student.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Students were required to rate themselves prior to having an instructor rate their performance.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>While carrying out the learning plan, the instructor would be observing performance and, on occasion, be confirming a performance rating on the spot.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In other cases, confirmation of performance came at the end of the learning activity, problem or project – but always only after a self rating was given.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Some instructors often set schedules to meet with learners to have performance levels confirmed.</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>The self rating and confirmation session with an instructor was a performance review much like that of a supervisor and worker.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Ratings could be confirmed at the level indicated by the learner, could be increased or lowered.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The greatest learning, I believe, took place when a rating was being changed, either raised or lowered but especially if being lowered.</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Since learning is a spiral process, readers will realize that learner performance on any skill, even if already confirmed by an instructor could be either raised or lowered by an instructor as the program progressed.</b></p>
