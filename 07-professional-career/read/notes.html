</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Extensive research notes synthesizing literature on performance-based assessment and competency analysis. Glendenning documents the shift from input-based to outcome-based education, noting that &quot;certificates and diplomas should be awarded based on demonstrable skills rather than hours of instruction.&quot; He explores performance assessment&#x27;s advantages over traditional testing: better validity, more useful feedback to unsuccessful candidates, improved knowledge assessment, and potential cost-effectiveness. He emphasizes that &quot;informed professional judgment is essential&quot; to reliable assessment and advocates for competency analysis as the foundation for certification standards. The notes reveal Don&#x27;s deep engagement with educational research and his conviction that better assessment drives educational improvement.</div>

	Assessment on a combination of techniques; Traditional methods data

	inference is made about the individuals capacity to do  certain
	things in the future; In performance assessment, data is collected
	on the application of knowledge, the use of skills and on attitudes
	in real or simulated settings;  inference is still used ie on the

The demonstration of certain skills is usually associated with the
application f knowledge and/or its synthesis.  This is a higher form
of knowledge than is usually tested in traditional exams. 
Performance based assessment usually puts people in a position where
they have to comprehend, apply analyze, synthesize, and evaluate data
and information”  Performance has the potential for assessing
knowledge better than traditional assessment.</p>

but gaps still exist.  .  Standards are increasingly competency
based.  A competency analysis has become the basic document on which
certification requirements are based .  Organizations using a
competency analysis  have a head start; they have taken the first
step in instituting performance based standards.  Those organizations
not using a competency analysis should start now.  More will be said
about competency identification later in this paper.</p>

<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
Performance based rating scales are the weak, or more often the
missing, element in current occupational standards.  Most of the
material which I have reviewed on the subject fail to recognize this
component.  Current standards, for the most part, continue to
differentiate performance levels by what the person can or cannot do;
insufficient attention is paid to how well they do it.  Levels of
performance are poorly defined or missing.

<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
The essence of a performance standard lies in identifying the
competencies to be demonstrated and the level of performance expected
on each.  The concept is simple but gets lost in the bureaucracy of
implementation.  We’ve made a simple model un-necessarily complex.

By way of example, many readers, I am sure, are called upon to “edit
text”.  It is a clear and unambiguous statement.  I can edit text
and consider it one of my competencies.  I am quite sure, however,
that many, if not most, readers can perform at a much higher level
than I.  It is likely that they can edit more quickly, more
accurately, with less supervision, and with fewer checks in available
references.  In other words, others perform at a higher level than I
on this competency. Whereas classifying people by whether or not they
can “edit text” is one component of a standard, the level of
performance is a distinct and separate factor.</p>

</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
I am not sure why people who set standards are so reluctant to adopt
a performance based rating scale.  Perhaps it arises from a desire to
be, and to be seen to be,  objective; that is, a desire or a
requirement to remove judgement from the process.  Judgement cannot
be removed and trying to do so is a waste of valuable time.   
Assessing performance involves judgement; our objective should be to
make the judgement portion as fair, reasonable, consistent and
transparent as possible.	</p>

Training standards and occupational standards are not the same
although much of the current literature fails to make the
distinction.  The lines between the two are frequently obscured and
in, some instances, one is mistaken for the other.  The confusion is
widespread.  Occupational standards stand alone.  They identify what
a person can do and how well the person can do it.  The
implementation of standards is a sorting process.  Occupational
standards are not based on the amount of training, the nature of the
training, where the training as provided or by whom, or even the
grades obtained in the training institution.
