<p>----</p>
<p>As vice-chancellor of a British university, I recognise how vital it is for universities to support one another during a time of extensive reform in the higher education sector. Yet one question I am regularly asked is: why is <span>Keele University</span> not aligned to a mission group and never has been?</p>
<p>With mounting pressure on universities to lead the growth of our knowledge economy, it continues to surprise many of my contemporaries that being part of a mission group is a move Keele regularly considers, but has not yet been persuaded to undertake.</p>
<p>The simplest answer is that none of the existing mission groups provide a natural fit for Keele, a university founded on a principle to break away from established patterns. Keele is not unique in this respect, as a significant number of universities choose to be non-aligned, a fact frequently overlooked in the media and political engagement with the sector.</p>
<p>In an article for the Guardian earlier this year, Peter Scott surmised that universities are always going to be <span>"more different and individual" than the identity they share with their mission group</span>, and this is one of my main concerns with group alignment.</p>
<p>Yes, mission groups aim to highlight diversity in the sector, encourage collaboration and stimulate debate – the <span>Russell Group</span> provides the prevailing example of how a group can rally strength in numbers to create a powerful voice to stimulate change. Yet for me, being aligned brings with it greater risks of marginalising a university's own interests for the benefit of the wider group, which cannot be ignored.</p>
<p>Firstly, the very nature of group politics means that each group has clearly defined parameters, usually controlled by two or three dominant universities and voiced by just a handful of spokespeople. Doesn't alignment to a group come with an added pressure to pursue and conform to an agreed agenda, potentially sidelining your institution's interests and concerns? – particularly when these interests either aren't a priority for the group, or worse still, are not shared by the group at all.</p>
<p>Secondly, we need to consider the strong public identity of each group, and the impact of this on its members. We see time and again how MPs, parents, students and the media find mission group "identities" helpful to their own analysis. The group identity aids in the compartmentalisation of what its members stand for and each university becomes inextricably associated with its group colleagues and their latest campaigns, successes and failures. While there are undoubtedly some benefits to be had by this association, for me they are surpassed by the risk of being overshadowed, outshone and, in some cases, tarred by the overarching interests of the group, potentially causing lack of understanding about a university's offering and dampening its wider profile.</p>
<p>Most importantly for me, are the negative effects of alignment on innovation in the sector as a whole. Arguably, it discourages competition between universities aligned to the same group and creates a hierarchy where research funding and investment are more likely to be granted to universities in the Russell Group because of its collective success and powerful presence, as opposed to universities in other groups, which have an outstanding track record of developing world-leading research within smaller institutions.</p>
<p>So is Keele non-aligned simply because of the negative aspects of mission-groups? No. In my three years as vice-chancellor, I have found a number of positive reasons for Keele's standalone approach. Clearly, it helps Keele to define its own identity and interests without conforming to an overarching body, but what's more, it means we are viewed as more of a neutral, non-partisan university. I have found that senior colleagues are more likely to be invited to sit on thinktanks and committees to discuss issues in the sector and voice Keele's view.</p>
<p>Perhaps most importantly, it provides my staff with more opportunities for partnerships with a broader group of institutions, as we are not bound to collaborate with universities within our group.</p>
<p>For me, universities have the majority of their issues in common. We must be prepared to come together strongly around these issues, rather than simply allowing the compartmentalisation of the sector to provide an easy option for policymakers and resource providers to engage with the mission groups which, by definition, only ever represent a minority of the sector.</p>
