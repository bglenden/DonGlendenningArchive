<p>1. Meeting called to order by Dr. G. By reviewing following points:</p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li8">he is convinced we need to get engagement/ time to get debate in open/ not necessarily looking for agreement</li>
  <li class="li8">need to probe more what people are interested in “info is fuel for change”</li>
</ul>
<p>2. Newsletter: Do we need one?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Discussion around who is it for? How do we circulate? Copying? How to make more visible?</p>
<p>Electronic version? Paper version? Content?</p>
<p>Conclusions</p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li8">Yes, we need a newsletter.</li>
  <li class="li8">Focus needs to be on improving Quality of Education for everyone.</li>
  <li class="li8">Not too wordy. include quick facts, and/ or tips for parents and teachers/bits and pieces of significant information</li>
  <li class="li8">can advertise community engagement meetings</li>
  <li class="li8">local, national, international info on education.</li>

</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p>3. <b>Discussion on Community engagement:</b></p>
<p>Questions arising and discussed.</p>
<p>What would we achieve?</p>
<p>What would we do with info gathered?</p>
<p>Some discussion on inviting articles to be published in our newsletter, some concerns raised included<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>How to judge what to publish? What about copyright? What about quality of submissions?</p>
<p>Conclusions:</p>
<p>Yes, a good thing to do if we can encourage people to do things differently</p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li8">Must be a focused discussion</li>
  <li class="li8">Community participants will want to hear new things for example we must legitimize we are speaking for a broader community</li>
  <li class="li8">Possibility of developing a discussion guide for community engagement.</li>
  <li class="li8">Re articles: suggestions was made that perhaps could engage education students at UPEI by calling for submissions to get their perspectives on various related topics to stimulate wider discussion.</li>
</ul>
<p>This was thought to be a good idea but that we could defer this until we get website activated down a little further down the road and so was put on back burner for further discussion.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>4. Dr. G asked question of group </b>regarding his writing of articles for publication in local paper etc.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Did we think it could be perceived as a conflict?</p>
<p>Question was discussed and there was agreement that it could be confusing since he is well known as an advocate for change and so is the organization Education First Inc.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Conclusion:</b></p>
<p>Dr. G would write on behalf of Education First Inc. expressing views of the organization.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>He could/would however do occasional papers based on his personal opinions and values, which may or may not be those of the organization.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Note:</b></p>
<p>(Perhaps to be clear in distinguishing Dr. G could cite “the opinions/etc. expressed in this paper are his own and do not necessarily reflect the views of Education First Inc.)<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Meeting Concluded with the following listed as our immediate priorities:</b></p>
