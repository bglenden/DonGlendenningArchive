<div class="reader-summary">A brief document on occupational standards focusing on the distinction between what someone can do versus how well they do it. Drawing on his federal labor department experience, Don notes that standards discussions historically focused on training inputs rather than performance outputs. He argues existing standards emphasize range of tasks but neglect performance levels, illustrated by the difference between apprentice and journeyperson performance on the same skill. Don advocates for identifying broad performance criteria (quality, speed, supervision required) and establishing employment-based levels that are recognized by practitioners, clearly stated, readily understood, and easily applied. He contends the challenge remains unmet of creating standards that balance comprehensiveness with practical applicability.</div>

<p>STANDARDS: THE NEXT HURDLE</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>As a new employee of the Federal of Labour some three decades ago, I was soon introduced to the idea of national standards. It was a hot issue and was frequent included on agendas of Directors of Apprenticeship, Directors of Vocational Education, Directors of the newly emerging Institutes of Technology, etc. The focus of these discussions was on training standards. I know because I was at a number of the meetings.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Some of the initiatives intended to deal with the issue of training standards included:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>preparation of occupational analyses;</p>
<p>preparation of functional analyses of entire industries;</p>
<p>agreement on program content;</p>
<p>training for technical and vocational teachers;</p>
<p>agreement on criteria for awarding diplomas and certificates;</p>
<p>common program entrance requirements; and regular meet among program managers institution directors.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Most of the above initiatives were related to training input; not much attention was ven at the national level to output standards. Some of these initiatives are still around but others have fallen by the wayside.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>In recent months, I have had an opportunity to revisit the issue of standards; much of the old debate exists even to the issue of provincial jurisdiction. But much has also happened with HRDC and Sectoral Councils leading the charge. I am eased to report, furthermore, that the emphasis has switched from input measures to output or fo!rnlaIloe based measures. A sl fi development, indeed. But more needs to be done. A major component of standards setting remains relatively untouched</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I base my conclusions on considerable of the the year or more including a fairly extensive literature, involvement in a number of surveys and ring activities, considerable discussion with much reflection.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>ect during revi.ew of information colleagues and</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The remainder of my comments deal with occupational standards.</p>
<p>are different from but related to training standards. More importantl development of quality training standards must be based on ccupa ional standards.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The establishment of based occupational standards must takE': in. account two things, n.amely, what one can or should be able to do and the level at which a person can or should be able to do it. Exist standards are heavy on the former and light on the latter.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Let me illustrate the point through apprenticeship. The expected performance of a journeyperson and that of an ice dif in two ways. The journeyperson is expected to be able to perform a larger range of skills than the apprentice. This difference is usually fairly easy to establish.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The other difference however, is in the level of performance on each skill with the journeyperson being able to at a hi level. Levels of on a skill may show in such ways as a better quality product or service, the mak of a or delivery of a service in a shorter period of time and the extent or amount of supervision red to ensure a quality product or service. I am sure all of us can identi other criteria against which performance is measured.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>So what is the problem with existing standards? Based on my rev i e'\i\l , the answer 1.S simple. Current standards errlpllasize what one can do but pay insufficient attention to how well one can do i.t</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The challenge is to identi broad-based performance criteria and to develop recognizable levels of based on them.</p>
<p>These levels should be employment based, be recognized by people using them, be clearly stated, readily understood and easily applied. It is possible but we are not there yet.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
