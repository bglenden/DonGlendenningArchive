<p><b>CONCLUSIONS</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>The following summarizes the writer's </b><span><b>conclusions:</b></span></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>1.	A distinction should be made between the DACUM model and a DACUM chart. The writer proposes the following:</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>o	</b>DACUM is a systems model for planning, developing, organizing and managing competency based training and education.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>o	</b>A DACUM chart is a single sheet presentation of the skills included in an occupation or field which results from a structured brainstorming session of practitioners from the field.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><b>2.	DACUM, as practised today, is essentially a Canadian development.</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>3.	The single page course presentation at Clinton, Iowa was only one such model available to people of the day.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The other major contributor was the presentation of OCCupational and functional occupational analyses prepared by the Government of Canada.</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>4.	Howard Clement saw the value of a single sheet presentation of curriculum and introduced it to colleagues and friends.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The first DACUM Chart produced in Canada was quite different in both process and product than that used in Clinton, Iowa.</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>5.	Robert Adams established the idea of a disciplined competency analysis by practitioners as the basis of the DACUM model.</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>6.	The early implementation of DACUM in British Columbia reflected the model described in the document </b><span><b>Designing a Curriculum</b></span><b>.</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>7.	The BC Division of Technical and Vocational Curriculum, under the direction of Derek Franklin, under contract to the Department of Regional Economic Expansion, provided the first significant documentation on the approach to curriculum development and presentation based on the Clinton approach.</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>8.	Robert Adams of Nova Scotia NewStart Corporation developed an entire CBE systems model under the DACUM acronym using a rigorous performance based analysis as the foundation document.</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>9.	In recent years, the differences between a DACUM analysis prepared in BC and analyses based on the Nova Scotia model have been significantly reduced.</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>10.	Holland College was the first institution to adapt the DACUM chart as a basis for all its programs.</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>11.	Holland College was the first institution to implement a "complete" and integrated CBE system based on the DACUM model.</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>12.	Most users of DACUM use it only to identify competencies.</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>APPLICATIONS OF DACUM</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>DACUM has a number of major components or applications:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Χ	The first, and most widely used, is the analysis process.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>DACUM is a rigorous, relevant, inexpensive and internally consistent approach to identifying competencies in a field or occupation. And it is community based or, in the case of employment oriented training, it is based on a knowledge of the occupation or field as experienced by practitioners. It is readily understood by people in the field because it reflects what they do and is stated in a language that the field understands.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Χ	The rating scale is unique; it identifies achievement in terms of performance.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It includes all the required elements of a good rating scale<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>- competencies, performance criteria, a scale, and benchmarks.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Both criteria and benchmarks are rooted in and recognized by the employment community.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Χ	A<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>DACUM analysis is a tremendous tool for identifying and planning learning resources.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>For each competency, one can identify the kind of human resource expertise required; facilities, equipment and supplies; appropriate learning activities; assessment techniques and strategies; and the best location for learning whether it be a classroom, laboratory, shop or actually in a real work situation.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Χ	DACUM includes a simple yet comprehensive system for a learner to follow and for the management of learners by teachers.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It provides for an assessment of prior learning, a tool for career planning, a basis for learning plans, a place for recording learner progress and achievement, a foundation for certification and a planning tool for lifelong learning.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And it ensures that learners and teachers are "singing from the same hymnbook". <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Χ	A DACUM analysis can also be a basis for sorting learners for the purpose of credentials.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Certification can be for a single competency or for a grouping of competencies.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Sorting may also result in acceptance or rejection for employment, classification for pay or promotion or for acceptance or rejection to other levels of education.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Χ	DACUM is not limited to school use; DACUM has applicability to business and industry even well beyond the training department.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>DACUM can be used as a basis for making decisions about an organization.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Job responsibilities can be easily identified and relationships and overlaps between jobs quickly spotted.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It can be used as a basis for performance review, employment counselling and promotion.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Χ	Finally, DACUM provides a useful tool for planning and executing lifelong learning.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is an on-going record of what one can now do and at what level; it provides a framework to identify gaps between where one now is compared to where one wants to be.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It can become a useful tool for planning and negotiating the selection and purchase of training by and for a learner. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>SPREAD OF DACUM</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Dissemination of information about DACUM in the 1970's occurred from five major sources:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>4.	Humber College, Toronto, operated a DACUM Exchange through which charts were obtained from developers and distributed for a fee to other interested parties.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>5.	</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>DACUM COMPARISON</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Perhaps the best way to introduce this section is to recall a discussion in the early 1970's between the writer and Dr. C. R. Ford, former Director of the Training Branch for Employment and Immigration and who directed the expansion of programs and facilities under the Technical and Vocational Training Assistance Act during the 1960's.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>At the time of this conversation, Ford was directing the Zambia project but had returned to Canada to attend the annual conference of the Canadian Vocational Association which was being held in Edmonton.</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>As Ford explained his work in Zambia and the implementation of DACUM, it soon became evident that the application of DACUM in Zambia and that at Holland College were significantly different.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was only now that the writer really understands the basis of the differences which existed in the early years and, to some extent, still exist today.</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>A comparison of DACUM as described by Clement and followed in the initial stages in BC and DACUM as developed by Adams reveals a number of substantive similarities and differences.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They are shown in Figure 10.</b></p>
