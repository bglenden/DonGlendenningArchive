<div class="reader-summary">Sam Dillon reports on trends showing American colleges spending more on recreational facilities and administration while proportionally reducing expenditure on instruction. Study by Delta Cost Project analyzed spending 1998-2008, documenting a shift toward &quot;country-clubization&quot; of universities. Private research universities increased spending on instruction 22% over the decade, but 36% for student services and 36% for institutional support. Community colleges show similar patterns. The article criticizes this reallocation as inconsistent with educational mission and notes the economic crisis has made spending models unsustainable.</div>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.17in; line-height: 0.24in">
American
colleges are spending a smaller share of their budgets on
instruction, and more on recreational facilities for students and on
administration, according to a new study of college costs. 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.17in; line-height: 0.24in">
The
report, based on government data, documents a growing stratification
of wealth across America’s system of higher education. 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.17in; line-height: 0.24in">
At
the top of the pyramid are private colleges and universities, which
educate a small portion of the nation’s students, while public
universities and <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/c/community_colleges/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier"><u>community
colleges</u></a>
serve greater numbers, have fewer resources and are seeing tuitions
rise most rapidly. 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.17in; line-height: 0.24in">
The
study of trends in revenues and spending by American institutions of
higher education from 1998 through 2008 traces how the patterns at
elite private institutions like <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/h/harvard_university/index.html?inline=nyt-org"><u>Harvard
University</u></a>
and <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/a/amherst_college/index.html?inline=nyt-org"><u>Amherst
College</u></a>
differed from sprawling public universities like <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/o/ohio_state_university/index.html?inline=nyt-org"><u>Ohio
State</u></a>
and community colleges like Alabama Southern. 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.17in; line-height: 0.24in">
The
United States is reputed to have the world’s wealthiest
postsecondary education system, with average spending of around
$19,000 per student compared with $8,400 across other developed
countries, says the report, “<a href="http://deltacostproject.org/analyses/delta_reports.asp"><u>Trends
in College Spending 1998-2008</u></a>,”
by the Delta Cost Project, a nonprofit group in Washington that
advocates for controlling costs to keep college affordable. 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.17in; line-height: 0.24in">
“Our
analysis shows that these comparisons are misleading,” said Jane
Wellman, the project’s executive director. “While the United
States has some of the wealthiest institutions in the world, it also
has a ‘system’ of postsecondary education with far more economic
stratification than is true of any other country.” 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.17in; line-height: 0.24in">
Community
colleges, which enroll about a third of students, spend close to
$10,000 per student per year, Ms. Wellman said, while the private
research institutions, which enroll far fewer students, spend an
average $35,000 a year for each one. 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.17in; line-height: 0.24in">
Undergraduate
and graduate enrollments nationwide grew to 18.6 million students
overall in 2008 from 14.8 million in 1998, an increase of 26 percent,
the report said. Among all the sectors that make up American
postsecondary education, public community colleges added the most
students over the decade, growing to 6.3 million from 5 million. 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.17in; line-height: 0.24in">
Enrollment
at private colleges and universities, by comparison, grew to 2
million students from 1.8 million in the 10 years. 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.17in; line-height: 0.24in">
Tuition,
on average, rose more rapidly over the decade at public institutions
than it did at private ones. Average tuition rose 45 percent at
public research universities and 36 percent at community colleges
from 1998 to 2008, compared with about 21 percent at private research
universities. 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.17in; line-height: 0.24in">
But
the trend toward increased spending on nonacademic areas prevailed
across the higher education spectrum, with public and private, elite
and community colleges increasing expenditures more for student
services than for instruction, the report said. 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.17in; line-height: 0.24in">
The
student services category can include spending on career counseling
and financial aid offices, but also on intramural athletics and
student centers. 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.17in; line-height: 0.24in">
“This
is the country-clubization of the American university,” said
Richard Vedder, a professor at Ohio University who studies the
economics of higher education. “A lot of it is for great athletic
centers and spectacular student union buildings. In the zeal to get
students, they are going after them on the basis of recreational
amenities.” 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.17in; line-height: 0.24in">
On
average, spending on instruction increased 22 percent over the decade
at private research universities, about the same as tuition, but 36
percent for student services and 36 percent for institutional
support, a category that includes general administration, legal
services and public relations, the study said. 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.17in; line-height: 0.24in">
At
public research universities, spending for student services rose 20
percent over the decade, compared with 10 percent for instruction. 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.17in; line-height: 0.24in">
Even
at community colleges, with their far smaller budgets, spending on
students services increased 9.5 percent, compared with 3.4 percent
for instruction. 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.17in; line-height: 0.24in">
The
study also said that the <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/r/recession_and_depression/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier"><u>recession</u></a>
that began in the last months of 2008 has dramatically changed the
economics of higher education, probably forever. 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.17in; line-height: 0.24in">
“The
funding models we’ve created in higher ed are not sustainable,”
Ms. Wellman said. “We ran up spending in the ’90s and early 2000s
to levels we can’t maintain, and this is true not only in the elite
privates, but in many of the public institutions, too.” 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.17in; line-height: 0.24in">
Now,
with private-college endowments battered and state legislatures
slashing university budgets coast to coast, “policymakers as well
as university presidents and boards must learn to be better stewards
of tuition and taxpayer dollars,” she said.
