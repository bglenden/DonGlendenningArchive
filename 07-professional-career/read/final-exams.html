  Final Exams
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Published as &quot;MY 200 WORDS&quot; commentary, Glendenning questions the term &quot;final exams,&quot; suggesting it contradicts lifelong learning ideology. He distinguishes between exams for learning (diagnostic, improving) and exams for qualification (certifying competence), arguing only the latter belong outside schools. Schools should assess ongoing learning; external qualification authorities should determine competence for employment or further study. He advocates making validation available to lifelong learners, so people acquiring skills outside school can have learning recognized. The document exemplifies Don&#x27;s precision in educational terminology and his concern for validating learning wherever it occurs.</div>

<p><b>Final Exams</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>While browsing the morning paper (Guardian, January 25, 2010), my eye caught a reference to final exams; it seemed so ominous.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>What, I wonder, makes exams in January, or any other time of the year, one’s final exams? Are they for students with a terminal illness?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Are these final in terms of individual students or final as far as the institution is concerned?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Then I wondered, if my doctor called my next exam my final exam, what would that mean? <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Would that be even more ominous than a final exam for learning?</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>A final exam for students implies, at least for me, that students are not expected to learn anything further.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The term is at odds with the concept of life-long learning.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The day or week after exams are finished, a student may have a significant learning experience; maybe even while taking the exam.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The exams mentioned in my morning paper are more likely to be semester or year-end finals.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But they could also reflect the fact that the school will no longer offer that subject ad, therefore, the school will no longer assess student performance in it.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>One’s record of learning in school plays a significant role, I believe, when seeking employment or acceptance to further study.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>So where, in the scheme of things, can a student who has had significant learning experiences outside school have that experience validated, or measured and reported?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If we believe in lifelong learning and want to encourage it, and I think that most people do, we should make it easy for people who learn outside the school have that learning validated. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Examinations are, and should be, an important tool in helping people learn.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The assessing of what has been learned for the purpose of<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>obtaining a qualification, or obtaining employment, is an entirely different matter, and has no place in schools.</p>
