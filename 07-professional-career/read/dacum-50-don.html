<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">The
decade of industrial expansion immediately after WW2 was made
possible by the influx of skilled immigrants from Western Europe.  By
the late 1950’s, however, it became evident that Canada could no
longer depend on this source of supply. Furthermore, large numbers of
Canadians remained unemployed even though Canada suffered from a
shortage of skilled workers.  The Technical and Vocational Training
Assistance Act (1960) provided massive funding to remedy the
situation. During the 1960’s Canada and the Provinces mounted a
technical and vocational training program to prepare Canadians to
participate in the post war industrial expansion.  Cost were shared
by the federal and provincial governments and resulted in an
initiative that was the envy of many countries.  In the mid 1960’s,
TVTA administrators joined with officials working on the issue of
high unemployment and slow economic growth and pooled their efforts
in support of a series of demonstration projects.  These projects,
called Canada NewStart Corporations, were funded by the Federal
Government but given a large degree of independence as to the
clientele and focus of their research.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">The
Nova Scotia NewStart Corporation was established in Yarmouth, Nova
Scotia in 1967 with Tom Jones as Director and Robert Adams as
Director of Occupational Training; the project focused on skill
training for rural youth.  Given Adams experience in occupational and
functional analyses, it was not surprising that analysis was a
cornerstone of his research.  In Nova Scotia, Adams worked directly
with local employers and unemployed youth to develop relevant
training for people wanting to improve their lot in life.

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.11in; line-height: 108%">Each
training program was preceded by an analysis of competencies
practiced by high performers in the occupation.  Adams convened a
group of practitioners and, those who supervised them, with Adams,
himself, facilitating the analysis process.  The group engaged in a
three-day brainstorming process during which individual competencies
were printed on small cards and posted in rows on a large blank wall.
When completed, competencies were transferred to one side of a large
single sheet of paper.  Called, DACUM (Developing a Curriculum) the
chart itself was simply a map of competencies in an occupation or
field sequenced from left to right roughly as they would be
encountered in the occupation.  Competencies were selected as
appropriate for the purpose of curriculum development, student
tracking, school transcripts, a basis for certification or a map of
further training. The result was a single-sheet presentation of
competencies which could be used by a variety of users.  With DACUM
chart in hand, Adams developed a competency based delivery model

College, a College of Applied Arts and Technology in Prince Edward
Island was established by an Act of the PEI Legislature on April 15,
1969; on May 1 the Board of Governors approved a paper outlining the
nature of its offering and style of operation; the College opened its
doors to students on September 2, 1969.  Staff met weekly to  and
soon developed a set of operating principles for the new institution;
next came a search for an operating model.  Visits were made to
Canadian Forces Base Kingston to view Performance Oriented
Electronics Training (POET), the Technical Education Research Project
in Cambridge, Mass (Biomedical Equipment Technician Program) and
modular curriculum development activities at College Montmorencie, a
new CEGEP located in Quebec City, all the while keeping an eye on
innovations happening elsewhere. Exploration also included a visit to
the Nova Scotia NewStart Corporation in Yarmouth, Nova Scotia to see
DACUM in operation following which Adams was invited to Charlottetown
on March 2-4, 1970 to lead the first analysis, that of Secretarial
Arts.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">The
Holland College Diary carries the following item dated July 2, 1970:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">“College
adopts individualized learning program adapted from DACUM system as
developed by Nova Scotia NewStart Inc.  Program is to be based on
performance objectives and will provide for: (1) recognition of
previously acquired skills; (2) continuous intake; (3) individual
rates of progress; (4) consultative evaluation; and (5) individual
termination times.  System is to be known as STEP (Self Training and
Evaluation Process)”</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">In
the mid 1970’s, Holland College became a test site for resource
materials for a teacher education project under development by the
Vocational Education Centre at Ohio State University.  During
discussions leading up to the contract, the Center Director, Robert
E. Norton, visited Charlottetown.  Norton was impressed with the
DACUM mode, became an advocate and driving force in its spread,
although a modified version, throughout the USA.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">As
to DACUM’s originator, Robert Edwin Adams was born in Swan Lake,
Manitoba   in 1932, where he also attended school. His father not
being well, Bob took over the operation of the

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">the
family farm at a very early age; he moved to Winnipeg where he
studied and later taught at the Manitoba Institute of Technology.
Following completion of Bachelor’s degree at Bradley University,
Bob moved to Ottawa where he worked in the Training Branch of the
Department of Labour as an occupational analyst.  In 1967 he moved to
Yarmouth where he was Director of Training at the Nova Scotia
Newstart Corporation. With the close of the Newtart Corporation, Bob
moved to Dartmouth Nova Scotia where he operated his own firm,
Competency Systems, until his death in 2016.</p>
