<p><b>An Introduction</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>From time to time I am asked where I got my education.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As an example, recently I was asked by an organization to provide some information for their files – introductions, promotions and birthdays mostly, but increasingly it seems for obituaries.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I decided to respond on the spot, sat at a nearby table, whipped out my pencil and started filling in the blanks.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was a short form; tombstone data came quickly, name, address, date of birth, etc.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Then there were several boxes devoted to education.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I reported that my work ethic came from my family, my knowledge base probably was a combination of formal study, travel and from reading, moral compass probably reflected my initial home community, etc. I turned in the form and was about to move on when the form was handed back indicating that what was wanted was the list of schools and universities attended.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And herein lies the first challenge in improving education, the confusion in both the public mind and that of educators, as to what we mean by education and what constitutes an education system.</p>
<p>At birth, we are thrown somewhat unceremoniously onto the road of life and thereafter, and as long as we live, will continue to dealing with personal and societal needs, fears, hopes and the ups and downs of life.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A road of life may be described in many ways; I’ve adopted the Life roles model developed in 1990 by the State of Oregon; it identifies life roles as that of an <span>Individual, Learner , Producer, Citizen, Consume</span><span>r and Family member.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span></span>Our education is all the things we learn to do to help us on the road of life. <span>Our education is the of all those changes<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Each person is unique, we have different stages of health, different interests, different kinds and levels of previous learning, different attitudes and learning style. We may have lived in a different culture, had mor or less secure and loving families<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><span>Education is a lifelong process; it is a process of growing, changing and developing.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span></span>Getting an education is a process of learning, and learning is a process of changing behaviour.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That may be a new knowledge, a new skill or an old skill at a higher level or a change of attitude – or some combination thereof</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>So why do we learn?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We learn because we are curious, we learn to fit in with the crowd and we learn when circumstance impact us learn to help us cope with and contribute to our various life roles.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is a developmental<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>process of engaging in experiences that have a formative effect on the way we feel, think and act; this effect is usually expressed in terms of a person’s attitudes, skills and knowledge. Education is an individual matter, others cannot kearn for us although others may help. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>We are all different, we all struggling with the same issues, all need help all need the same kind of help but in a different measure and mix<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Differ in a number of ways conditions , etc Education is an individual matter<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Education is for all of us – you, me, our families, friends neighbours – in fact for everyone we know as well as people we don’t know.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>\literally, everyone <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Ultimate responsibility is our own</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Wheree do we learn We learn anywhere and everywhere. Home and community biggest influence; school has been estimate at 20-30 percent<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Learning is not limited to what we do at school; much of our learning<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>happens outside school.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Some of our most important learning occurs at home, at church, in our communities, through sports, conversations around the kitchen table, from family and friends. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>It is widely recognized that education is a key factor in determining one’s quality of life; in the same way, the collective education of our citizens will determine to a significant degree the future of our community and country.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Need help, community provides help why?</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Our futures, as individuals and as a community, depend, to a large degree, on the nature and level of education available to, and actually attained by, our citizens.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Education helps us to develop our individual potential to the fullest and prepares us for our many life roles* that of an individual, family member, learner, citizen, producer and consumer.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This means engaging in a variety of activities with a view to assembling a variety of skills, knowledge and attitudes supportive of functioning in those life roles. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Based on this thinking, the quality of one’s education would be measured by how well one is able to function in the various life roles. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>One’s education is the result of everything that we learn in our lifetime that has had a formative effect on us.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It starts at birth with some of our most important learning occurring in the first few year of life; skills learned at that time, to a large degree, determine what we become in later life.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Learning is a partnership and nowhere is that partnership more important than in improving the reading level of every citizen.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Key to success in education generally, is reading, the golden skill, and a tool for lifelong learning.<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Statistics reveal the magnitude of the task.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We are aware of the attention given by our Ministers of Education in Atlantic Canada to increasing literacy rates, including reading, and this increased attention appears to be paying dividend.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Reading is a community problem; it cannot be solved by schools alone. Early childhood development sets the stage for reading. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>We recognize that learning to read, and learning to read better, occurs in the context of learning to communicate generally and includes learning to listen, to write and to speak.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We also believe, however, that it is important to understand<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>each component separately, and propose to commence our examination with the field of reading. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Education System</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>We believe that an education system should:</p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li9">Focus on needs and interests of individual learners<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li9">Recognize educational experiences gained outside schools</li>
  <li class="li9">Include engagement of learners, parents and the public at large. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li9">Encourage and recognize independent learning.</li>
  <li class="li9">Provide schools with significant autonomy and teachers with maximum professional freedom and accountability.</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>What we’ve learned or not learned, determines to a large degree who we are, and the life style available to us. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><b>Why is education important</b></p>
<p><b>Helps you do things</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Education system</b></p>
<p>Because of this, we are among the world leaders in our investment in ensuring that our citizens, especially our youth, have access to a variety of educational activities and experiences. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Our education system developed over decades and served us well, however, there are significant changes occurring around us that demand some different responses; our education system is unlikely to make the desired changes by itself.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But there is a gap between what Islanders have and what they want in the way of education. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>I’ve spent most of my life in education first as a student, then as a teacher and administrator, and now as an interested observer and sometimes commentator. During the past few months I have re-engaged in<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>the field, read widely, exchanged views with parents, educators, employers and students and reflected on the results. In a nutshell, I find a widespread concern about the quality of education available to our citizens, especially by the public school system.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The following concerns stand out:</p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li4">Basic skills, sometimes referred to as universal skills, employability skills or just plain literacy.</li>
  <li class="li4">Bureaucracy that delays and obscures decision-making and accountability</li>
  <li class="li4">Inability or unwillingness to cater to needs of individual learners.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li4">Failure of increased investment to capture benefits.</li>
  <li class="li4">Widening gap between public expectations and actual improvement</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p>The public is experiencing a changing world and an education system that continues to resist it; the updating of buildings, infusion of technology or additional training<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>for staff gives an illusion of change but more is needed, and the public wants to be part of the change process.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Real change requires considerable rethinking of ways to better support learners and learning, and the kind of system that can best deliver that support.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Educators, it appears, are reluctant to engage the public in the education process, therefore it is unlikely that the desired changes will occur without a measure of external interventions.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I’ve wrestled with what I heard and learned from my many conversations and have now concluded that the missing element is concern for the learner; the learner has been replaced with concern about standardized testing, burnout, the place of technology or qualifications of teachers. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The paragraphs that follow begns to address that problem; this one is focused on learners and learning; hopefully, there will be a follow-up learning model and one on the elements of a support system.</p>

<p><i>.</i></p>
<p><i></i><br></p>
<p><i>The road is crowded with people of all ages, stages of development and each with their own mix of live roles.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In the same way that life roles impact on our needs for help, so does our stage of development.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The very young are a special case in that they are so dependent on others, especially parents.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></i></p>
<p><i></i><br></p>
<p>Life Stages:</p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li13">Early childhood</li>
  <li class="li13">Childhood</li>
  <li class="li13">Young adult/youth</li>
  <li class="li13">Adult</li>
  <li class="li13">Mature adult<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li13">Senior</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><i>Success, fulfilment and<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>enjoyment on the road of life involves learning many new behaviour and modifying many others. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>So, what is learning? What happens when we learn?</i></p>
<p><i></i><br></p>
<p><i></i><br></p>
<p>In a nutshell, to learn is to change behaviour.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Educators talk about domains of learning but in simple terms learning is about changing attitudes, skills and knowledge.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A change of:<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li4">Attitudes, the affective domain – means that we act in a way that is different from before – perhaps we are more positive,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>more cheerful or<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>better team players.</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li17">Skills – the psychomotor domain- speaks of our ability to perform existing skills better or to perform new skills<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><span><i> – perhaps learning to play a musical instrument or developing career skills is a good example. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></i></span></li>
</ul>
<p><i></i><br></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li4">Knowledge – the cognitive domain<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>- addresses the matter of additional or new knowledge</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>As I tried to point out earlier, learners are complex people in that they bring such a range of experiences to each new learning situation.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Learning, therefore, is a very personal experience, a very personal matter.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Each makes our own decision as to what to learn or not learn,; but it should be pointed out that we learn at our pace, in our own style, for our own reasons and, although we may learn in a group setting, learners may or may not be learning the same things.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>How can we tell when someone has learned? It’s easy, at least in theory.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Earlier, we said the learning results in a change of behaviour and behaviour changes can be demonstrated, observed and measured.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We may not always do what we have learned but we can do it if we want to.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>I’m of the view that most people can learn whatever they want to learn; some may learn more quickly than others, some may learn at at a higher level, but all can learn.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>There are number of things, I call them conditions, that usually help us learn.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I’ve listed some below:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Nurturing learning</b>:</p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li19">Early Childhood Development</li>
  <li class="li19">Encountering Opportunity</li>

  <li class="li19">An objective or purpose</li>
  <li class="li19">Receiving feedback<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li19">Relating the new to what you already know and can do</li>
  <li class="li19">Recalling and summarizing</li>
  <li class="li19">oing about it in an organized way</li>
  <li class="li19">Practice makes permanent</li>
  <li class="li19">Demonstrating and helping others</li>
  <li class="li19">Using more than one of the senses</li>
  <li class="li19">Full access to relevant information – outcomes</li>
  <li class="li19">Diagnosid/assessment</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Hindrances</b></p>

  <li class="li13">Poor study habits</li>
  <li class="li13">Lack of confidence in abilities</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p><i>Our education is the sum total of all that we’ve learned or, perhaps better described as </i>all the learning that has a continuing formative effect on us.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>To be consistent wit my earlier thoughts,<i>Getting an education is about learning the things we should know or want to know to help us function well and enjoy our time in our various life roles.</i></p>
<p>We have an education whether or not we’ve spent a day in school, college or university.</p>
