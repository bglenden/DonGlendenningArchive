<p>Research shows that smaller schools:</p>

<p><span>􀂃</span><span> </span>elevate teacher satisfaction,</p>

<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li5"><span>􀂃</span><span> </span>increase parent and community involvement.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Pros and cons/benefits may include:</b></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li3">Smaller schools may be especially important for disadvantaged students by more individualized attention and teachers being able to address different learning styles.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li3">Smaller schools may promote substantially improved achievement and higher grades</li>
  <li class="li6">improved instructional quality and working conditions.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li6">greater job satisfaction for the small school faculty<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li6">an environment in which students may be more visible.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li6">Student-teacher relationships improve, allowing teachers to more easily identify individual talents and unique needs of each student, which offers a more personalized educational experience.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li6">eachers are able to interact more with their faculty administrators.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li6">A small school staff size allows more opportunity for teachers to know each other well, more easily share information about their students, collaborate to solve problems, and generally support one another.</li>
  <li class="li6">on a cost per-graduate basis, small schools have been shown to be more efficient.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li6">While small schools alone are not the solution, they can prove to be a useful platform for improved student achievement.</li>
  <li class="li7"><span>Five previous rigorous studies of this program and other small school initiatives have demonstrated significant benefits for students</span><span>.  </span></li>
  <li class="li6">Students randomly offered a seat at a small school accumulate 1.4 more credits per year, attend school for 4 more days each year, and are 9% more likely to receive a high school diploma.</li>
  <li class="li6">Small schools are rated higher than fallback schools by student survey respondents on the overwhelming majority of questions on engagement, safety and respect, academic expectations, and communication.  Surveys indicate that students feel safer and have closer interactions with their peers and teachers, despite reporting a smaller variety of course offerings and activities.  Teachers indicate greater feedback, increased safety, and improved collaboration.</li>
  <li class="li3">Extensive research over the last decade shows that small schools make excellent learning environments for students, and that, despite economies of scale, they are often cost effective because of their higher graduation rates. Creative and proactive strategies must be developed now to recognise the value of small schools and to ensure their viability and that of their communities.</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li9"><span> Colorado </span>Research on school size points to several conclusions about the benefits of smaller schools. Smaller school size has been associated with higher achievement under certain conditions. Smaller schools promote substantially improved equity in achievement among all students, and smaller schools may be especially important for disadvantaged students. Many US schools are too large to serve students well, while smaller schools, especially in impoverished communities, are widely needed. The evidence favoring the benefits of small schools, however, cannot be generalized to so-called “Schools Within Schools,” which to date lack a substantial research base supporting the belief that they provide benefits equivalent to smaller schools.</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p>Recommendations Ontario)</p>
<p>o ensure the viability of Ontario’s small schools, People for Education recommends</p>
<p>that the provincial government:</p>
<p>1) Appoint representatives from Ontario’s school boards, federal, provincial, and</p>
<p>municipal governments to work together to develop co-ordinated policies and</p>
<p>programs to support and sustain small schools and their communities.</p>
<p>2) Implement the recommendation of the Education Equality Task Force to</p>
<p>“establish a Cabinet-level advisory council on integrated services for children</p>
<p>and families, composed of representatives from the Ministries of Community</p>
<p>and Family Services, Education, Health and Long-Term Care, Public Safety and</p>
<p>Security, and Tourism and Recreation, to meet on a regular basis to align the</p>
<p>work and the funding mechanisms of the ministries that serve families, children</p>
<p>and youth.”</p>
<p>3) Develop provisions in provincial funding to reward rather than penalize school</p>
<p>boards that enhance the function of school buildings by providing municipal</p>
<p>services, health care, community services, social services, parks and recreation,</p>
<p>libraries, and/or child care within their walls.</p>
<p>4) Implement each of the recommendations in the Rozanski report, including the</p>
<p>• Provide core support funding for small schools in single school communities;</p>
<p>• Update benchmark costs to provide boards with additional funding to sustain</p>
<p>those small schools that boards decide to keep open;</p>
<p>• Update the School Operations Allocation to provide boards with funds to</p>
<p>ensure that their small schools are safe, clean and well-maintained;</p>
<p>• Review the benchmark factors and capacity criteria to ensure that boards</p>
<p>that have small schools in single-school communities are not penalized for</p>
<p>keeping those small schools open.</p>
<p>5) Establish optimal enrolments for elementary and secondary schools based on</p>
<p>research data, and supported with new per pupil funding benchmarks to ensure</p>
<p>that schools have principals, secretaries, teacher-librarians, and guidance counsellors</p>
<p>and to ensure that all students have access to viable physical education</p>
<p>and music programs.</p>
<p>6) Adjust transportation guidelines and funding to ensure that no student spends</p>
<p>more than 1½ hours per day on the school bus.</p>
<p>7) Enact a standardized review process for the construction and closing of schools</p>
<p>to include:</p>
<p><span>􀂃</span><span> </span>mandatory involvement of municipal governments in decision-making,</p>
<p><span>􀂃</span><span> </span>mandatory consultation periods of no shorter than six months, and mandatory</p>
<p>reports on the economic and social impact on the affected communit</p>

<p>Policy makers should:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>• Find ways to sustain existing small schools, especially in impoverished rural and urban communities.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>• Acknowledge an upper limit for school size, acknowledgment that means many schools should be much smaller than the upper limit.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>• Not design, build, or sustain mega-schools serving upwards of 500 to 2,000 students, depending on educational level and grade-span configuration.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>• Design, build, and sustain much smaller schools in impoverished districts or districts with a mixed social-class composition. In very poor communities, design, build, and sustain the smallest schools.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>• Not oversell smaller schools. Operating smaller schools in impoverished communities is good policy, but it is not a “magic bullet.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>• Not believe that mega-schools serving affluent areas are necessarily excellent or even very good. Most accountability schemes obscure this fact because they do not generally take socio-economic status into account.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>• Recognize that smaller schools in impoverished settings accomplish miracles even when their test scores are about average.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
