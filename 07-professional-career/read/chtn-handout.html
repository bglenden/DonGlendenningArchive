<div class="reader-summary">Comprehensive public handout contextualizing the youth preparedness issue. Don frames youth challenges (high debt, low incomes, unemployment, emotional stress) alongside systemic issues (sluggish economy, low literacy rates). He emphasizes that these are community issues requiring concerted stakeholder action. His call for joint effort among learners, parents, employers, and community members exemplifies his inclusive leadership philosophy.</div>

<p><b>Education and Preparedness</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>Youth today are facing many issues including high debt load, low incomes, temporary employment, emotional stress, lack of jobs and high unemployment; the good news is that there is growing recognition that something needs to be done, and soon.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>On the one hand, a sluggish economy reduces opportunity for employment; on the other hand young people lack skills and experience needed to take advantages of the opportunities that do come along.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As a result, our young people are at risk of an uncertain future. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span>Low rates of youth literacy are at play in the issue.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>For example, an International Adult Literacy and Life Skills </span>survey in 2003 revealed that nearly half of our youth have low literacy rates and, in fact, the rates had not improved during the previous 10 years. Until these figures improve significantly, PEI will have difficulty in attracting high skilled industries and retaining our young people.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span>In order to better understand the issues of youth, The Community Foundation of Prince Edward Island (CFPEI) undertook a survey of over 200 Island youth on a number of issues that directly affect them; the report, </span><span>Taking the Pulse of Island Youth</span><span>, available on the Foundation website, www.cfpei.ca, provides a snapshot of findings.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span></span>Bright spots include a positive sense of community, emerging entrepreneurial opportunities, volunteerism and new postsecondary offerings.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Main concerns include lack of jobs, surviving on low paying jobs, educational deficiencies and drug and alcohol addictions.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>On the subject of education and learning, the study reports a high rate of completion of high school and postsecondary education, a high level of inclusivity and relatively affordable tuition costs.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In terms of “preparedness”, however, participants report relatively low levels of achievement on PISA tests in reading, mathematics and science.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>These are serious issues, but they are not school issues, not even education issues, they are community issues, issues that strike at the very heart of what we are and what we want our community to be.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The report identifies the issues and provides a place to start.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Resolving the issues will take a concerted and joint effort by all stakeholders, especially learners, parents, employers and the community at large. <span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>To increase understanding of the issues faced by youth, Education 20/20 plans a number of public discussions on the CFPEI report.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The purpose is to learn more about youth issues in our community, to explore in particular the issues of education and learning, and to identify actions to be taken, if any, to address<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>them.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Each session will include a review of CFPEI findings and be followed by small group discussion.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Dates, times and locations will be announced on our website, <span>www.caneducation2020.com</span> and in the public media.</p>
