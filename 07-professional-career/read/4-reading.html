  4 Reading
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Comprehensive April 9, 2013 synthesis of Don&#x27;s reading education research and advocacy. Positions reading as golden skill and tool for lifelong learning within education framework emphasizing individual potential development across life roles. Emphasizes reading as community problem requiring partnership approach beyond school boundaries. Catalogs extensive statistics on reading challenges, identifies performance levels from emerging pre-reader through expert reader, and details key performance criteria (comprehension, material variety, syntax, fluency, vocabulary, sound-decoding). Documents reading competencies, development strategies, benchmarks, and intervention points. Includes practical proposals: reading as separate report card subject, consistent standards, rating scales, flexible scheduling, summer/evening/Saturday classes, tutoring, reading clinics. Catalogs issues (emphasis gaps, funding continuity, jurisdiction divisions, specialist shortages, professional association absence, parent support gaps, reporting inconsistency). Proposes comprehensive improvement strategy incorporating information, engagement, innovation, recognition, research, early diagnosis, and modernized delivery. Reflects Don&#x27;s commitment to making reading improvement systematic, community-wide effort.</div>

<p>My Notes</p>

<p><b>ALL NOTES ON READING</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>Our futures, as individuals and as a community, depend, to a large degree, on the nature and level of education available to, and actually attained by, our citizens.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Education helps us to develop our individual potential to the fullest and prepares us for our many life roles* that of an individual, family member, learner, citizen, producer and consumer.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This means engaging in a variety of activities with a view to assembling a variety of skills, knowledge and attitudes supportive of functioning in those life roles. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Based on this thinking, the quality of one’s education would be measured by how well one is able to function in the various life roles. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>One’s education is the result of everything that we learn in our lifetime that has had a formative effect on us.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It starts at birth with some of our most important learning occurring in the first few year of life; skills learned at that time, to a large degree, determine what we become in later life.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Learning is a partnership and nowhere is that partnership more important than in improving the reading level of every citizen.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Key to success in education generally, is reading, the golden skill, and a tool for lifelong learning.<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Statistics reveal the magnitude of the task.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We are aware of the attention given by our Ministers of Education in Atlantic Canada to increasing literacy rates, including reading, and this increased attention appears to be paying dividend.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Reading is a community problem; it cannot be solved by schools alone. Early childhood development sets the stage for reading. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>We recognize that learning to read, and learning to read better, occurs in the context of learning to communicate generally and includes learning to listen, to write and to speak.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We also believe, however, that it is important to understand<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>each component separately, and propose to commence our examination with the field of reading. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p><b>LITERACY</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Literacy</b> is defined as the ability to understand and use printed information at home, at work, and in the community to achieve one’s goals and develop ones knowledge and potential.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Literacy is not about whether or not one can read but how well one reads</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Components</b></p>
<p>Traditional descriptions identify the following components or kinds of literacy:</p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li24"><b>Prose - </b>the ability to find and use information contained in text such as newspapers, magazines, textbooks and tourist literature.</li>
  <li class="li24"><b>Document –</b> the ability to find and use maps, charts and employment forms, <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li24"><b>Numeracy –</b> the ability to find and manipulate numbers in relation to such tasks as keeping household records, placing an order, checking a grocery bill and tipping for a pizza delivery.</li>
  <li class="li29"><span><b>Problem solving –</b> the ability to </span>analyze information related to a given situation and generate appropriate responses</li>
</ul>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li24"><b>Oral communications</b> – ability to provide or obtain information through speech and gesture.</li>
  <li class="li24"><b>Computer skills</b> – the ability to use computers and related technologies</li>

<p><b>Observations/conclusions</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li24">Clients fall into two broad categories – adults and young people still in school; there has been little improvement in levels of literacy in either group in past decade</li>
  <li class="li24">There is little exchange of information among service providers<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li24">Services to adults, except for programs offered at Holland College, are quite ad hoc and often depend on annual applications for funding <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li24">There is a stigma attached to the term literacy; literacy may be an acceptable umbrella term but offerings to individuals should more specific - reading, problem solving, etc.</li>
  <li class="li24">One piece of research suggested that what is provided is at odds with what is needed.</li>
  <li class="li24">There is a view that the way schools are organized is at odds with requirements for successful literacy programs (classroom schedules, annual reassignments of teachers, etc)</li>
  <li class="li24">Schools could benefit from some approaches used by private schools<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li24">No person or position has an overall view of literacy or is in charge of the response</li>
  <li class="li24">Bursaries can play be an important motivator especially for people moving from Level two to level three.</li>
  <li class="li24">It has been suggested that the “best bang for the buck” comes from helping people move beyond level two</li>

<p>Although my review did not provide the clear and sharp statistics that I had hoped for, there is not doubt about the need for training in literacy both in Canada and in PEI. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Statistics that I reviewed show that:</p>

<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li5">Review your child’s report card.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Do you understand it?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Does it make sense? That doesn’t necessarily mean that you agree with it but does it make sense?</li>

  <li class="li5">What action does the teacher recommendations?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li5">Remember that the Minister sets the standard, defines the curriculum, licenses the<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>teacher, hires teachers, sets the time allocations and other conditions under which your child learns.</li>
