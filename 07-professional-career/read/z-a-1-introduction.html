<p><b>A LEARNING FRAMEWORK</b></p>
<p><b>Introduction</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Given that learners and learning are at the heart of education, we start our conversation about what we know and believe about learners and learning.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b>Understanding the learning process will help with our own learning, but it will also help us become more effective in supporting the learning of others, including our children. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>To provide a framework for making decisions about learning, Education 20/20 Inc. has developed a series of webinars, short clips on a variety of subjects available at the touch of your fingers.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Each presentation is in outline form and of 3-4 minutes duration. Each may be viewed alone or with others, and we’ve included questions for you to mull over at the end of each unit.</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Some time ago, each of us was dumped unceremoniously on life’s road, and we’ve been travelling<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>that road ever since; the road itself has many twists and turns, hills and hollows, and smooth and<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>rough patches as well.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>While on the road, we fill many roles, that of an individual, family member, citizen, learner, consumer and producer.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Our education helps us in our travels; it helps us understand, prepare for, adjust to, extricate from and manage situations we encounter along the way.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Our education is the outcome of experiences that change us. What we can do today, as compared to what we were able to do yesterday or twenty years ago, constitutes our education – that is, any and all experiences that have changed us, all the experiences that have had a formative effect on what we think, feel and do. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Consider the presentations as providing a framework, a framework that will:</b></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li4"><b>help our understanding.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></li>
  <li class="li4"><b>improve the consistency of our decisions, and <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></li>
  <li class="li4"><b>insure that elements are left out by design not by accident.</b></li>
</ul>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>There are many ways to build a framework, we’ve adopted one that revolves around the learner and the learning process; this series includes presentations and discussions on:</b></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li4"><b>Learners<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></li>
  <li class="li4"><b>Learning</b></li>
  <li class="li4"><b>Levels of learning, and a</b></li>
  <li class="li4"><b>Learning flow-chart</b></li>
</ul>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>We hope that your experience with this series will contribute in some small way to making better decisions about your learning, and providing better assistance to learners you help.</b></p>
