  4 Speaking
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Dated July 31, 2012, draft document defining speaking as conveying information in spoken language. Positioned as background to broader communication skills improvement initiatives for Islanders of all ages. Identifies four key communication components (reading, writing, speaking, listening) for separate treatment while recognizing typical combination teaching. Don indicates this draft document will evolve through ongoing learning and implementation of improvements. Brief document appears incomplete, emphasizing background framework for speaking skill development parallel to his work on listening and reading.</div>

<p><b>SOME NOTES ON SPEAKING</b></p>

<p><b>About this paper:</b></p>
<p>This paper is intended as background to discussions about the improvement of communication skills among Islanders of all ages.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Our review of the literature, discussion with people both inside and outside the formal education system and our own beliefs support the view that communication skills are important, that they can be learned, and can be improved through formal instruction.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>For the purpose of this initiative, we view the key components as reading, writing, speaking and listening; while usually taught in combination, for the purposes of clarity, each will be dealt with separately.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This is a draft document and expected to continue in that form as we learn more and more about the subject and improvements that are likely to arise are in place and working effectively.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Background:</b></p>
<p>Good listening skills result in better communication skills overall, for listeners and for speakers. Evaluating listening skills requires knowledge of what constitutes good listening--attention given to the speaker, active listening by note-taking, avoiding external distraction, body language and asking follow-up questions.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
