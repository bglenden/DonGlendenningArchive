  Re-engineering
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Major policy proposal by Don advocating comprehensive education system re-engineering, replacing time-based schooling with student-centered learning via education advisors and competency-based certification. Demonstrates his innovative education reform philosophy and structural thinking about institutional transformation.</div>

<div class="reader-content">
<p><b>Re-engineering Education</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>Our education system is quite outdated; it emphasizes schooling rather than education, is inflexible,</p>
<p>accountability is scattered, there is too much emphasis on time spent in a class or on a subject,</p>
<p>allows little choice by learners and lacks clear and consistent standards.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Tinkering with the system won't do. We need to do more than strike a new committee, undertake a</p>
<p>new public survey, add or change courses, increase teacher pay, revise the curriculum, add more</p>
<p>professional development days or purchase a few new computers. The system could profit from</p>
<p>some re-engineering. But where do we start? The following structural changes would be high on</p>
<p>my list.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Provide each student with an "education advisor", a person with a role similar to that of a family</p>
<p>doctor, with whom the learner or parent could consult at any time on matters pertaining to the</p>
<p>education of their child. Most of us would not be very happy if we had a new family doctor each</p>
<p>year, especially if the new doctor was not of our choosing. An education advisor would, for the</p>
<p>most part, provide advice and direction during at least K through 12, however, it could be longer if</p>
<p>needed. Students could elect to change advisors but advisors would have no choice in selecting</p>
<p>students; advisors could refuse to take a student only if they were not accepting additional students.</p>
<p>The educational advisor would provide an access point to the education system, provide continuity</p>
<p>for each learner; the advisor would work closely with each learner providing advice, instruction and</p>
<p>referral to specialist teachers as needed. Student transcripts would be signed off by the educational</p>
<p>advisor.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Our current system of awarding degrees, diplomas and certificates interferes with getting an</p>
<p>education. Teaching and certifying are very different functions; they serve different purposes.</p>
<p>Pursuing an education is more than, perhaps even entirely different from, pursuing a diploma or</p>
<p>degree; in fact, awarding degrees and diplomas, in my view, is not even an educational function.</p>
<p>Education should be seamless and lifelong; awarding diplomas and degrees Balkanizes the field</p>
<p>and the function. In the same way, good health is not measured by the number of trips to the doctor</p>
<p>or hospital, the list of medicines prescribed or to an exercise regime, a good education is not</p>
<p>described by courses taken, years studied or certificates awarded. These activities may contribute</p>
<p>to one's education but are not a measure of one’s education.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Degrees, diplomas and certificates are or represent qualifications; they provide recognition to the</p>
<p>recipient for activities in which they engaged; they are also a useful screening device for</p>
<p>employers. If we need certificates, let us set up one or more qualification authorities to award them</p>
<p>- not unlike the City and Guilds in England or the New Zealand Qualification Authority. Teaching</p>
<p>and sorting are two entirely separate functions and having teachers and institutions both teach and</p>
<p>sort constitutes a conflict of interest.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>A qualification authority should do what its name implies, assess an individual's skills and issue an</p>
<p>appropriate qualification. Qualifications should begin with an assessment process and not be linked</p>
<p>in any way to years of schooling or courses taken. A person interested in obtaining a qualification,</p>
<p>would make application and undergo an assessment. If the applicant meets the standard, the</p>
<p>qualification is granted; if the applicant does not meet the standard, no qualification is awarded but</p>
<p>the student is given a detailed set of requirements to close the gap. That description could be taken</p>
<p>to an educational institution and form the basis of additional studies. Or the individual could study</p>
<p>on his own and return at a late date for a new assessment. The cost of examinations and awarding</p>
<p>degrees and diplomas would be met through a separate fee.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Learners should have more choice including more choice as to when, where and what they will</p>
<p>study. But the system also should be designed so that learners can choose their schools and even</p>
<p>their teachers. Taking advantage of choices may result in additional cost and inconvenience to a</p>
<p>learner or parent including the cost of transportation - but that is so in accessing many other</p>
<p>services. Obviously, choice will be greatest in larger centres. Excess demand for an individual</p>
<p>teacher would be dealt with in the same way as excess demand on a lawyer or dentist. This change</p>
<p>will demand considerable creativity among educational planners; however, consumers have choices</p>
<p>in other sectors of their life so why not in education. If we believe in choice, we will find a way to</p>
<p>allow it to happen</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Paying people for what they know or how long they've known it is overdue for a change. We need</p>
<p>to replace the current system of teacher pay from one that emphasizes what the teacher knows to</p>
<p>one based on what a teacher does. Currently teacher pay is based on a grid that takes into account</p>
<p>preparation and years of experience. That model needs to be replaced with a system that takes into</p>
<p>account the work done, number of people served and complexity of task. Some teachers, but not</p>
<p>necessarily all, should be able to dramatically increase their earnings; the current system, I feel,</p>
<p>holds back deserving teachers. The top of the salary range needs to be moved up dramatically;</p>
<p>teachers should be able to earn as much as a lawyer, accountant, dentist or a medical doctor. The</p>
<p>current grid does not and will not allow this to happen.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>No other professional is under the same kinds of strains and pressures as teachers; they tend to be</p>
<p>lone operators for long hours each day. It need not be that way. I recall visiting a school a few</p>
<p>years ago in which the school's ranking rose from second lowest in the system to second highest</p>
<p>during a two year period; officials attributed the change in ranking, not to new curriculum, not to</p>
<p>longer days, not to more in-service training for staff, but to a dramatic increase in student/adult</p>
<p>contact. What the school did was to replace 7 teachers with 14 teaching assistants. A review of</p>
<p>school staffing is certainly in order. But the system could also benefit from more highly qualified</p>
<p>specialists, in the area of diagnosis for example, to be available to teachers who deal with difficult</p>
<p>situations on a daily basis. The same specialists would also be available to students by referral.</p>
<p>This service could well be of greater benefit to learners and teachers than some of the services now</p>
<p>provided by Departments of Education.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>When I make suggestions like these in casual conversations, I am usually met with "But wouldn't</p>
<p>that be difficult?" Probably. But the question should be "Would a learner benefit from increased</p>
<p>choice, published standards and more contact with adults in his/her learning? Having an education</p>
<p>advisor? If the answer is no, the ideas should be abandoned. If the answer is yes, we should seek</p>
<p>ways to make it happen.</p>
