  Issues-3, Schooling-1
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">This lengthy document explores systemic issues in schooling, treating issues as complex problems requiring deep analysis. Don distinguishes between issues, symptoms, and incidents, and provides methodology for issue analysis (who, what, when, where, why). He addresses five major issues: Focus on Knowledge (learner-centered versus subject-centered instruction), Professional Freedom (autonomy and accountability), Delivery Model (administrative versus educational functions), Assessment and Standards (independence from teaching), and Credentials and Qualifications. The paper advocates for learner-centered approaches, teacher autonomy in instructional decisions, separation of coaching from referee functions (grading/ranking), outcome-based education, and independent assessment bodies. Implementation strategies include public campaigns, school autonomy, community advisory boards, and learner-focused policies.</div>

<p><b>BACKGROUND</b></p>
<p><b><span class="Apple-converted-space">              </span></b></p>
<p>Issues are topics, problems or concerns of importance to groups of people; they are the big questions.<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Issues are not simple problems for which definitive answers can easily be found.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>On the contrary, they are complex and of significance. Once understood, the simpler questions can be dealt with and progress resumed. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It’s not always easy to describe an issue in precise terms; sometimes we confuse issues with symptoms and incidents.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>An issue may be current, that is a problem of today; emerging and potential issues, on the other hand, focus on those threats and opportunities that are like to impact on life tomorrow.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But the field is messy.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Issues arise in a variety of ways but often become of concern when they impact on personal interests, activities or events, or are related in some way to concerns of friends or family.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When trying to sort through issues, it is often useful to begin one’s analysis with the basic questions of who, what, when, where and why.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It may also be useful to browse or skim broadly in the field, such as browsing the internet, to get a feel for the issues.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In the case of education, while the organization is mine</p>

<p><b>ISSUE NO. 1: FOCUS ON Knowledge<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>Each learner comes to a learning situation, whether at home or in school, with a unique set of health conditions and also a unique pattern of skills, knowledge and attitudes; but they also have a unique set of interests, plans and ambitions; both what they’ve experienced and what they plan to do will have an impact on their learning.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Some may simply need information or advice, some may want instruction, feedback or resource material; all need encouragement.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Most if not all of the help needed is available within the community including the local school.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We simply have to find ways to identify and harness it for the benefit of learners.</p>
<p>All learners arrive at a new learning activity with previous experience; that’s one of the ways that learners differ.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They grew up in different homes, with different values, different culture, different relationships with other family members, different communities, their culture and even their access to learning opportunities; and the list goes on.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That’s the reality for all people.</p>
<p>But they also have different levels of wellness, physical, mental, emotional and social.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They have different interests, objectives, plans for what they want to do or be.</p>
<p>And they all need support of a kind and at a level that differs from fellow students. It differs at least in part because of their previous experience but also because of the lack or mix of support found elsewhere in their lives</p>
<p><br></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li6">Schools organize instruction around subjects, grades and time; they do so in spite of the fact Someone even went so far as to describe the role at the secondary level as that of an instructor rather than a teacher.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Teachers report that they have little time to focus on learners and their needs. Schools should focus, instead on learners and marshalling resources to help them learn.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>One way, of course, is to organize instruction It is not always easy but schools must find ways to deliver support to students as, if and when they need it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Schools can be organized to reflect learning with students being grouped to reflect the help they need or want rather than by age.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Testing should be reorganized to identify strengths and weaknesses and made available to that students may test out of sa module or course when ready, and move to the next level.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The use of technology such as on line courses may help. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Individualizing student assistance should be an objective but will not always be possible. On the other hand, grouping is likely within reach.</li>
  <li class="li6">And then, of course, there’s the matter of finding additional time for students needing extra help.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Here’s where extended days, weeks or even the extended year comes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I’ve often thought that it would be interesting to see the impact on learning of an extra 30, 40 50 days would make to a student’s performance.</li>
  <li class="li6"> Providing individual learner support should increase student engagement, something that also improves learning.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
</ul>
<p>Help for learning comes in many forms including Formal instruction, Tutoring, Coaching, Variety of approaches, Practice, Engagement, School culture, Referral to specialists, Information , Professional advice</p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li6">Counseling - Learners often need help in making educational decisions; most help counseling and advice is available<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>only through organizations that deliver courses</li>

<p><b>ISSUE 2: PROFESSIONAL Freedom<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b>1	Autonomy</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>Simply stated, there is a direct relationship between school performance and school autonomy. An OECD Report in 2010 reported that “In countries where schools have greater autonomy over what is taught and how students are assessed, students tend to perform better.”</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>In most professions, actual and implied accountability of the professional to the client is clear; not so in education.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Students and parents are on their own.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Let me give some examples.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li6">It is well known that parents are our first teachers and that the first 5-8 years determjne what we become.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>schools and teachers is not clear.What parents think schools do for their child and whWe often hear about the importance of having high expectation for students; the same can be said for schools.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Shouldn’t we be told, for example, PISA results for each school?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Apparently posting school results has a positive impact on school improvement.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>During the past month, the matter of school accountability has come up in conversation at least 4 times.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>None were clear as to the implied contract between student and his school.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>One referred to 192 days of quality care thereby relating the child care role.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Surely there is more to schooling than that.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Autonomy, or freedom to act, varies from country to country but may include such things as allocation of<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>resources, hiring and dismissing teachers, formulating budgets, decisions about curricula and assessment, course offerings and textbooks.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In practical terms, this means giving each school the freedom to:</p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li6">recruit, hire, assign and supervise any and all instructional staff whether full-time, part time, teachers, teacher aides or volunteers</li>
  <li class="li6">Set their own calendar <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li6">Adjust the school day</li>
  <li class="li6">Allocate funds within a budget to reflect the needs and priorities of students and the community he/she serves.</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p>But autonomy and accountability needs to be shared with teacher as well.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Teachers should have freedom to:</p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li6">Make decisions as to how best serve each individual</li>
  <li class="li6">Assign grades at their sole discretion<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
</ul>

<p>Toles of aupt, principals, supt<b> BACKGROUND</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>Schools are teaching institutions; we place our children in their care for which we pay schools about $10,000 per student per year. Students, and parents, deserve factual information about their progress. Direct feedback to the learner and parents is crucial. For each subject, a student should be told how well they are doing.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In reading, for example, a student deserves to know the vital signs of a good reader, comprehension, vocabulary, flow, and the steps that the school is taking or recommending to improve each subject. Based on the results, teachers should have a better understanding of what the student has learned and what is required if he/she is going to meet their learning objectives.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Results may also show that the teacher’s strategy needs changing or more time may be needed. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>It would appear, however, that much of the assessment process results in the ranking of students, to determine who is ahead and who is behind on the curve.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This approach is useful for picking winners but does little to help learners improve.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is likely that the relative ranking of a student on a subject changes little from semester to semester so why continue to emphasize it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Furthermore, at least in my view, establish a ranking is neither an educational function or school responsibility. While it may tell a student’s standing in relation to others, it tells nothing about corrective action.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Furthermore, asking teachers teach and sort places a teacher in a conflict of interest. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>It is not by accident that sports include both coaches and referees, lawyers present their cases but judges decide, we have accountants and auditors, and we read consumers reports before making decisions on major purchases.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There are many good reasons for sorting students but, when that happens, students deserve independent assessors</p>

<p><br></p>
<p><b>ISSUE 7: LIFE BASED OUTCOMES</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>Dr. William Spady, a sociologist and founder of the Network for Outcomes Based Schools, is widely credited with founding Outcomes Based Education (OBE). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span>OBE is </span><span>a student-centred, results-oriented, standards-referenced system of education premised on the belief that all individuals can learn. <span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></span> According to Spady, outcomes could be written with “<span>traditional, transitional, or transformational goals in mind”.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A scan of the literature suggests that most outcomes are used to meet traditional goals. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>An OBE system is learner centered in that:</p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li26">what is to be learned is clearly identified;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li26">each learner’s progress is based on demonstrated achievement;</li>
  <li class="li26">each learner's needs are accommodated through a variety of instructional strategies and assessment; and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li26">each learner is provided time and assistance to realize her or<span> </span>his potential.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p>Outcome statements always include an action word that identifies the performance to be demonstrated; some OBE users consider assessment criteria part of the outcome while others treat assessment as a separate issue.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Outcomes for PEI school courses can be found on the PEI Department of Education website.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Parents may find it useful to review curriculum guides and outcomes for the courses being taken by their children; students may find a copy of the outcomes helpful in orienting them to their program and courses.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p>Each learner comes to a learning situation, whether at home or in school, with a unique set of health conditions and also a unique pattern of skills, knowledge and attitudes; but they also have a unique set of interests, plans and ambitions; both what they’ve experienced and what they plan to do will have an impact on their learning.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Some may simply need information or advice, some may want instruction, feedback or resource material; all need encouragement.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Most if not all of the help needed is available within the community including the local school.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We simply have to find ways to identify and harness it for the benefit of learners.</p>
<p>All learners arrive at a new learning activity with previous experience; that’s one of the ways that learners differ.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They grew up in different homes, with different values, different culture, different relationships with other family members, different communities, their culture and even their access to learning opportunities; and the list goes on.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That’s the reality for all people.</p>
<p>But they also have different levels of wellness, physical, mental, emotional and social.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They have different interests, objectives, plans for what they want to do or be.</p>
<p>And they all need support of a kind and at a level that differs from fellow students. It differs at least in part because of their previous experience but also because of the lack or mix of support found elsewhere in their lives</p>
<p><br></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li6">Schools organize instruction around subjects, grades and time; they do so in spite of the fact Someone even went so far as to describe the role at the secondary level as that of an instructor rather than a teacher.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Teachers report that they have little time to focus on learners and their needs. Schools should focus, instead on learners and marshalling resources to help them learn.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>One way, of course, is to organize instruction It is not always easy but schools must find ways to deliver support to students as, if and when they need it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Schools can be organized to reflect learning with students being grouped to reflect the help they need or want rather than by age.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Testing should be reorganized to identify strengths and weaknesses and made available to that students may test out of sa module or course when ready, and move to the next level.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The use of technology such as on line courses may help. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Individualizing student assistance should be an objective but will not always be possible. On the other hand, grouping is likely within reach.</li>
  <li class="li6">And then, of course, there’s the matter of finding additional time for students needing extra help.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Here’s where extended days, weeks or even the extended year comes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I’ve often thought that it would be interesting to see the impact on learning of an extra 30, 40 50 days would make to a student’s performance.</li>
  <li class="li6"> Providing individual learner support should increase student engagement, something that also improves learning.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
</ul>
<p>Help for learning comes in many forms including Formal instruction, Tutoring, Coaching, Variety of approaches, Practice, Engagement, School culture, Referral to specialists, Information , Professional advice</p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li6">Counseling - Learners often need help in making educational decisions; most help counseling and advice is available<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>only through organizations that deliver courses</li>

<p><b>ISSUE 2: PROFESSIONAL Freedom AUTONOMY AND ACCOUNTBILITY</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>1	Autonomy</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>Simply stated, there is a direct relationship between school performance and school autonomy. An OECD Report in 2010 reported that “In countries where schools have greater autonomy over what is taught and how students are assessed, students tend to perform better.”</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>In most professions, actual and implied accountability of the professional to the client is clear; not so in education.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Students and parents are on their own.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Let me give some examples.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li6">It is well known that parents are our first teachers and that the first 5-8 years determjne what we become.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>schools and teachers is not clear.What parents think schools do for their child and whWe often hear about the importance of having high expectation for students; the same can be said for schools.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Shouldn’t we be told, for example, PISA results for each school?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Apparently posting school results has a positive impact on school improvement.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>During the past month, the matter of school accountability has come up in conversation at least 4 times.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>None were clear as to the implied contract between student and his school.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>One referred to 192 days of quality care thereby relating the child care role.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Surely there is more to schooling than that.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Autonomy, or freedom to act, varies from country to country but may include such things as allocation of<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>resources, hiring and dismissing teachers, formulating budgets, decisions about curricula and assessment, course offerings and textbooks.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In practical terms, this means giving each school the freedom to:</p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li6">recruit, hire, assign and supervise any and all instructional staff whether full-time, part time, teachers, teacher aides or volunteers</li>
  <li class="li6">Set their own calendar <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li6">Adjust the school day</li>
  <li class="li6">Allocate funds within a budget to reflect the needs and priorities of students and the community he/she serves.</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p>But autonomy and accountability needs to be shared with teacher as well.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Teachers should have freedom to:</p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li6">Make decisions as to how best serve each individual</li>
  <li class="li6">Assign grades at their sole discretion<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>

<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>We have complicated the matter of education by, what I call, sloppy language.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>By that I refer to the frequent practice of using education and schooling interchangeably.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This turns up in conversations as the question “Where did you get your education? When what is being asked is really only where you went to school.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A more important limitation resulting from the confusion, however, is the fact the narrowing of the meaning of education.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As a result one’s education is limited to the portion described or alluded to in diplomas and degrees.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I’ve taken a conscious decision, therefore, to identify issues associated with education from a learner’s perspective, issues that apply to a system as may be found in any Province and the educational issues associated with schools.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p>Toles of aupt, principals, supt<b> BACKGROUND</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>Schools are teaching institutions; we place our children in their care for which we pay schools about $10,000 per student per year. Students, and parents, deserve factual information about their progress. Direct feedback to the learner and parents is crucial. For each subject, a student should be told how well they are doing.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In reading, for example, a student deserves to know the vital signs of a good reader, comprehension, vocabulary, flow, and the steps that the school is taking or recommending to improve each subject. Based on the results, teachers should have a better understanding of what the student has learned and what is required if he/she is going to meet their learning objectives.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Results may also show that the teacher’s strategy needs changing or more time may be needed. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>It would appear, however, that much of the assessment process results in the ranking of students, to determine who is ahead and who is behind on the curve.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This approach is useful for picking winners but does little to help learners improve.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is likely that the relative ranking of a student on a subject changes little from semester to semester so why continue to emphasize it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Furthermore, at least in my view, establish a ranking is neither an educational function or school responsibility. While it may tell a student’s standing in relation to others, it tells nothing about corrective action.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Furthermore, asking teachers teach and sort places a teacher in a conflict of interest. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>It is not by accident that sports include both coaches and referees, lawyers present their cases but judges decide, we have accountants and auditors, and we read consumers reports before making decisions on major purchases.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There are many good reasons for sorting students but, when that happens, students deserve independent assessors</p>

<p><br></p>
<p>Jan Hodges (“Careers education needs to be an ongoing dialogue, in which information is discussed at every stage”, Manchester Guardian, Wednesday, May 29) identified the need to expand existing school-based counselling with “independent advice and guidance” about career education for 16-18 year-old youth; information would be directed not only to young people but also to their parents and teachers.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></p>

<p><b>ISSUE 7: LIFE BASED OUTCOMES</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>Dr. William Spady, a sociologist and founder of the Network for Outcomes Based Schools, is widely credited with founding Outcomes Based Education (OBE). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span>OBE is </span><span>a student-centred, results-oriented, standards-referenced system of education premised on the belief that all individuals can learn. <span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></span> According to Spady, outcomes could be written with “<span>traditional, transitional, or transformational goals in mind”.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A scan of the literature suggests that most outcomes are used to meet traditional goals. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>An OBE system is learner centered in that:</p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li26">what is to be learned is clearly identified;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li26">each learner’s progress is based on demonstrated achievement;</li>
  <li class="li26">each learner's needs are accommodated through a variety of instructional strategies and assessment; and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li26">each learner is provided time and assistance to realize her or<span> </span>his potential.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p>Outcome statements always include an action word that identifies the performance to be demonstrated; some OBE users consider assessment criteria part of the outcome while others treat assessment as a separate issue.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Outcomes for PEI school courses can be found on the PEI Department of Education website.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Parents may find it useful to review curriculum guides and outcomes for the courses being taken by their children; students may find a copy of the outcomes helpful in orienting them to their program and courses.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
