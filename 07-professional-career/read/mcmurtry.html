<p><b>Memorial Service</b></p>
<p><b>Walter S. (Bud) McMurtry (1922-2001)</b></p>
<p><b>January 6, 2002</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>Gathered to remember and pay respects to Bud McMurtry</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I first met Bud in Ottawa at a National meeting in 1962,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He was articulate, knowledgeable and represented the Island well around the Conference table.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>PEI became a founding member of a regional teacher training program.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Some things are easy to visualize:</p>
<p>A young lad growing up in Nova Scotia</p>
<p>A student<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>A husband</p>
<p>A father</p>
<p>A stint in the Navy</p>
<p>Arrival on Prince Edward Island to work with the Department of Agriculture</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>For a number of years Bud was Mr. Vocational Education in PEI</p>
<p>Bud was a jack of all trades</p>
<p>Director of Vocational Education</p>
<p>Larger Provinces had specialists in each area but Bud was responsible for everything - vocational High school education, training of technicians, apprenticeship, training of unemployed , vocational teacher training</p>
<p>The face of education on PEI changed under his leadership</p>
<p>Construction of PVI and PCVHS</p>
<p>A college of applied arts and technology was established</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>In 1969 he came to Holland college<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>As Program Planning Coordinator he spearheaded the establishment of the Atlantic Police Academy.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He worked with Police Chiefs and others involved in law enforcement to keep the initiative moving.</p>
<p>Chief Dan Allen, then in Chatham, was promoting police training.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We thought that we should talk with him.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Bud arranged with Someone, bill Rix, I think, to bring him over for the day</p>
<p>Later he was an instructor in the Academy - a role from which he retired</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Bud was a good communicator	distinguished looking</p>
<p>articulate</p>
<p>					a good listener</p>
<p>					liked to talk but did not boast of his accomplishmnts</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Bud and Myrtle were active in their church</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Active in scouting and rose through the ranks to be Provincial Ccommissioner</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Had a love affair with the sea.</p>
<p>Had a boat</p>
<p>Spent many hours on his boat, or perhaps more accurately, around his boat. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Seems to me that he spent more time cleaning, painting and repairing it than in actually sailing.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>He loved to moor off shore, turn off his CB and just enjoy the water<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>and being out of reach of the office</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>In the early years Bud taught courses in basic instructional techniques.</p>
<p>Students that that course was one of the best they ever had<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>His courses are still remembered</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>In talking with colleagues in recent days, these were the kind of phrases they used:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Articulate</p>
<p>An excellent instructor</p>
<p>So often in uniform – choir, navy, police academy uniform, scouts</p>
<p>Craftsman</p>
<p>Love of the sea</p>
<p>Very active</p>
<p>Very involved</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Bud McMurtry understood and believed in vocational education</p>
<p>He knew and practiced its basic principles</p>
<p>Many Islanders profited from the results of his good works<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The Island is richer because Bud was here</p>
