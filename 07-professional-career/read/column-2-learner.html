  Column 2 Learner
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">A reflective column recounting an anecdote where Don was asked about his education at a social group. When he provided a comprehensive answer about farm upbringing, teaching training, and industrial arts education, his questioner dismissed it, wanting only formal school information. The piece illustrates Don&#x27;s philosophical point about the limited, conventional understanding of &quot;education&quot; versus his holistic, lifelong view encompassing practical experience and skill development.</div>

<div class="reader-content">
<p><b>About Education</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><i>Where did I get my education?</i></p>
<p>I was asked not long ago where I got my education. I had joined a new group and expected to be a regular so I assumed that they wanted a bit of information for their records or in case someone needed notes to introduce me.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I was happy to comply. My questioner handed me a form to complete.</p>
<p>There were the usual questions, name, address, telephone number, Email address, where I was born, name of spouse, etc., etc, etc. not too difficult. Then came a space labelled “Education”.</p>
<p>Now that’s a question that invokes views. so I decided to elaborate in my answer. I mentioned growing up on a mixed farm which meant some involvement<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>with animals, vegetables and general<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>farm practices and, o course winter work in the woods. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I also mentioned that we each had chores to do and they varied<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>depending on the time of year.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I mention that I had traineed as a eacher, and separately as an industrial arts teacher,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>but did not say for how long.I thought that I had given a reasonable view of my educational background.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Soon my friend returned to the table, picked up the paper and walked away; two minutes later he was back.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>With a curt “I just want to know what school you went to”.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
