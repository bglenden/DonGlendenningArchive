<p>Off to the Woods</p>
<p>Undated manuscript</p>
<p>Typed and edited on June 19, 2016</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Wearing a pair of mother-made woolen mitts, I sat at the right end of the bunk on the front bobsled, feet resting on the runner as the team of grey horses (Queen and Lady?)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>trotted over the frosty, crunching snow.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Brother Norman sat at the other end of the bunk, urging and directing the team of horses towards the ridge.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The folded horse rug on the bunk protected our backsides from the cold bunk and provided a safety envelope to carry the sharpened double-bitted axes; we actually sat on the head of the axe.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A crosscut saw was fastened to the bunk of the rear sled.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A well-travelled track spread ahead, across the little Branch Road, in Uncle Jim’s lane, through the barnyard, across the fields and brook and into a thicket of spruce and balsam fir. further along we would pass the huge white pines and eventually reach our destination, a hardwood ridge.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>At the time, I slept in the little room over the kitchen, the one where the pipe from the kitchen stove came up through the floor a. turned east and entered the chimney.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I’d wakened before 6:00 to the rattle of the stove as Norman was starting the kitchen fire.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That was my signal to get up and get dressed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Woolen long-johns were the order of the day although I wore fleece lined underwear which was softer on the skin, woolen socks, Humphrey’s woolen pants, a redshirt, a cap with rear-muffs, and a heavy woolen Jacket was the typical dress for such an occasion.<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Scuffed work boots completed the attire but they were more comfortable and less sweaty than the gumboots I wore as a kid.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Soon we reached the cover of the woods where the sleds twisted, bumped and slewed over the hummock and hollow. Because of the way bobsleds were constructed and linked it was a relatively smooth ride; flat sleds would have thumped along and forced is to hold on.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The huge white pones reached the sky from pristine forest floor marked only by the lone rabbit tracks and the occasional rabbit run.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A few minutes later we reached the ridge marked, not so much by a rise in the land but by the change of trees.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Gone were the spruce, var and stately pine; in their place were the leafless beech and maple with a sprinkling of with a sprinkling of white and yellow birch an occasional ash (Treasured for axe handles \i later learned.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Norm selected an area to be cut; it was obvious that it was next to yesterday’s chopping.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We rugged the horses, removed the outer pair of mitts, set our lunch pails on a stump and then, axe and cross cut saw in hand trapped 50 yards through the knee-deep snow to a stand of birches.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The first was about a foot in diameter snow stopping in front of a white birch.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Since the tree stood straight and there was no wind, the direction of fall was simple, fall it so that the butt was closest to the road so that it would be easy to twitch.<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Norm stepped behind the tree and with a keen double bitted axe and a strong swing soon made a horizontal notch about 15 inches above the ground.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We grabbed our crosscut saw, each standing on opposite sides of the tree and started to saw on the side away from the notch. We dragged the saw in rhythm; the newly sharpened teeth cut the fibres and the drag-teeth removed the sawdust.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The trick to using a crosscut saw is a sharp saw, teamwork and rhythm.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As one pulled the saw, the other, at least ideally, steered the saw and pushed gently keeping the saw perfectly level reduced the friction and saved our energy for the actual cutting.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The saw move back and forth in rhythm until it almost reached the notch mentioned earlier.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We stopped, removed the saw and with a gentle push the once proud birch sprawled before us. Bouncing slightly when it hit the snow.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Not all trees were so easily felled. sometimes the leaned backward binding the saw.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>On such occasions a wedge would be driven into the kerf in an effort to change the center of gravity and make it fall in our preferred direction, Sometimes we would have to cut a small tree, say 8-9 feet long, and place in end under a branch up the tree to get better leverage when we pushed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If none of that worked, we’d remove a handle from the saw, remove it from the kerf and use an axe to deepen the slot.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But sometime none of these worked and the tree chose its own direction to fall.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>We used double-bitted axes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It seemed to me that the axe was both wider and thinner therefore removing wood faster.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Paul Bunyan used a double bitted axe <span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>and cut one tree on the forward swing and another on the back swing.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Pole axes, on the other hand, had only one cutting edge leaving the other available to drive a wedge.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Falling trees can be dangerous; sometimes they would fall unexpectedly, sometimes they would lodge in a nearby tree and sometime when rghtey lodged, the trunk would slide forward.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>One had to make sure that other workers and horses were protected.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Once sown, we proceeded to limb the tree and cut it into manageable lengths.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We usually started at the butt and cut a couple of 12 foot pieces the top of the tree was often left full length.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>About 11:00 am a small fire was started<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>usually on the road near the sleds using small dry twigs, a 5 pound shortening can was used as a kettle and suspended over the fire, filled with snow and brought to a boil.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Once the water was boiling, a handful of tea leaves would be added.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>After the tea steeped, a handful of snow thrown into the boiling tea would cause the tealeaves to sink to the bottom.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Some people ate mid-morning and again on mid afternoon</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Trees six inches or less in diameter were usually chopped rather than sawed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My chopping likened to the work of a beaver rather than that of a lumberjack.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Mother packed a lunch and usually consisted of bologna sandwiches always with homemade bread and may have put something on them other than butter bit \O cannot recall.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Sometimes we had jam or peanut butter sandwiches.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Lunch was usually topped off with a molasses or sugar cookie and sometimes with gingerbread.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>White cake, spice cake or oatmeal cookies were not unusual.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Given temperatures well below freezing, the contents of the lunch can sometimes require warming before being eaten.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>It was lunchtime for the horses as well; they always seemed to enjoy their oats and hay but they did not have the equivalent of a hot cup of tea to go with it.</p>
