  Levels of education 
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Glendenning&#x27;s critical analysis distinguishing between education and schooling - a recurring theme in his work. Defines education as &quot;any experience that has a formative effect on the way a person thinks feels or acts&quot; while schooling is &quot;that part of one&#x27;s education resulting from experiences planned and organized while in an educational institution.&quot; Critiques PEI Department of Education for focusing exclusively on children in school, suggesting this should be titled &quot;Department of Public Instruction&quot; instead. Advocates for provincial education systems that address all citizens&#x27; learning needs across the lifespan. Argues that distinguishing education from schooling clarifies communication, expands learning opportunities, and reinforces lifelong learning.

<p><b>Education and schooling</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>We often confuse schooling and education; we do not similarly confuse health and hospitalization, religion with church attendance or citizenship with court appearances.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Seldom do we conclude that a person is healthy because they spent time in a hospital or are religious because they attend church, mosque or synagogue regularly. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Good’s Dictionary of Education defines education<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>as “the aggregate of all processes by means of which a person develops abilities, attitudes and other forms of behaviour of positive value in the society in which he lives.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Mine is simpler than that; I define education as any experience that has a formative effect on the way a person thinks feels or acts.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A functional analysis would show schooling, or more likely “instruction”, as one of the functions of an education system</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Schooling, on the other hand is described in Good’s dictionary as “individual training or education received in an educational institution, military or civilian.”;<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>again I define schooling that part of one’s education resulting from experiences planned and organized for a learner while in an educational institution.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This may be an appropriste time to pause and verbalize your own definition</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The website of the PEI Department of Education, Early Learning and Culture includes a <span>Philosophy of Education</span>; a quick read tells us that the Department’s focus is on children but only those children who are in or preparing for; the structure of the Department reflects the same view.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Based on<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>their own documentation, a more accurate title would be Department of Public Instruction.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Department documents would leave the impression that the other 100,000 Islanders, those who are not children, don’t need or warrant an educational service. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Although not as familiar with New Brunswick and Nova Scotia Education systems, web documents suggests that the focus of those Departments also to be youngsters in school. In<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>taking this position, let me hasten to say that I am aware the all three Provinces provide support to other educational activities through other Government Departments but none seem to have a philosophy of education as a whole.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Readers may well ask why the fuss is and whether or not it makes any difference; I believe that separating<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>the two:</p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li4">Is required to put schooling in context</li>
  <li class="li4">Results in clearer communication among stakeholders.</li>
  <li class="li4">Expands our view of learning opportunities</li>
  <li class="li4">Would give rise to independent and lifelong learning</li>
  <li class="li4">Reinforce that education is limited to the study of traditional disciplines,</li>
  <li class="li4">De-emphasize the importance of personal skills such as self-reliance, problem solving, entrepreneurship and creativity.</li>
  <li class="li4">Blurs accountability</li>
</ul>
