	Harold Hall and Stanley Stavert, employees of Bruce Stewart
	manufacturing, founded Hall and Stavert in Charlottetown in the
	early 1930’s.  Whereas Hall Manufacturing, established by Harold
	Hall’s father, was widely known for its threshers, fanners, and
	horsepowers, Hall and Stavert was known for its “Marine Hardware
	and Motor Boat Equipment.  Their catalogue No. 21, undated, carries
	such items as hoists, stuffing boxes, steady bearings, pumps and
	fittings, and propellers.  By 1940 they had branched into making
	farm tractors, Hallmore tractors – or to be more precise,
	conversion kits so that farmers could convert their old cars into
	farm tractors.</p></li>

	Most farm tractors were
	purpose built, however, during the 1920-1930 period, a number of
	companies built conversion kits that allowed a farmer to convert his
	auto (whether a Model A, Chevrolet, Oakland or whatever) so that it
	could be used as a tractor.  The conversion kit usually consisted of
	a sturdy rear axle with rear wheels having strong cleats/lugs and
	was bolted to the car front end just behind the transmission. It was
	sometime referred to as the poor man’s tractor.   A farmer
	usually removed the back half of the body of his automobile, from
	the windshield back, detached the rear end and bolted on a tractor
	rear end, the conversion kit, and voila, he had a tractor.  The car
	could be driven in high gear because the gearing found in the new
	rear end gave the tractor the required pulling power.</p></li>

	Although aware of conversion
	tractors generally, I only became aware that such equipment was
	manufactured in PEI in 2004 or 2005 through a conversation with Jim
	Stavert, son of one of the founders of the company.  Jim told me of
	a phone call from a Mr. Heim from Chicago enquiring about Hall and
	Stavert.

	During a conversation with Dr. Wayne Cameron in the fall of 2008 at
	coffee break at the Eco-Centre in Mount Stewart, I mentioned my
	involvement in searching for heritage farm equipment, especially
	equipment made in PEI.   Wayne mentioned having been born in the
	Mount Stewart area, still owning some property there and, among
	other things, there were some old pieces of equipment that I should
	take a look at.  We agreed to talk further.</p></li>

	On a fine sunny day in April 2009, with Wayne as guide, we toured
	the Head of the Hillsborough and surrounding area.  At Wayne’s
	farm in Cherry Hill, formerly owned by Bea and Billie Crawford’s
	family since the 1930’s, were two steel wheels which appear to
	match those from a Hallmore tractor; there were other pieces buried
	in the grass but we were not able to retrieve them for
	identification purposes at that time</p></li>

	Bill Crawford was a locally but widely renowned aircraft mechanic
	from WW11 Lancaster days in Britain. After the war he rebuilt
	Warren’s sawmill and the associated dam before working with
	Maritime Central Airways in it’s earliest days when they were
	flying refugees from Europe and then developing the northern
	Dew-Line airstrips from scratch and then doing early Northern
	Ice-Patrols. He later worked with&nbsp; Enamel Heating Products
	overhauling Sabre Jets in Charlottetown and then with several local
	aircraft service companies at Charlottetown Airport. When MCA was
	moved to form Eastern Provincial Airways in Nfld, he retired to his
	old family home farm and machine shop where he built another
	saw-mill, a wind-powered generator and numerous other “inventions”.
	The Hallmore wheels logically date from his pre or early wartime
	mechanical innovations and activities.</p></li>

	I had with me <u>General Catalogue No. 21</u> published by Hall and
	Stavert in Charlottetown the catalogue is undated but thought to
	have been published around 1940.  Although mine is a copy of a copy,
	it clearly depicts a Hallmore “conversion tractor”.

	In May, while at his farm, Wayne searched further and found an axle
	(Ford) including front wheel bearings with a pattern of holes that
	matched perfectly the pattern and size of those in the wheels. 
	Using an available assembly like this would have avoided the
	necessity of manufacturing the hubs, bearings and seals with their
	required accuracy, alignment and fit.  The driving gear is missing;
	that is some sort of rear end with differential and ring or “bull
	gear” to supply power to the wheels.  Wayne arranged to transport
	the three pieces to Orwell and donated them to the PEI Museum and
	Heritage Foundation.</p></li>

	On Friday, June 5, Tom Hall and Jim Stavert, sons of the founders of
	Hall and Stavert, Tom LeClair, Linda Berko, Brent Partridge visited
	the Orwell Heritage site to view the pieces. To assist in the
	identification process, Jim Stavert had brought along a rendering of
	an early Hallmore conversion kit.  While there were some slight
	differences between that depicted in the literature and the actual
	pieces we concluded that they were normal changes based on their
	experience with the product.    It was our conclusion that the
	pieces found were genuine Hallmore tractor wheels but perhaps a
	later version.</p></li>

	In February, 2009, I phoned the Agricultural Museum at the former &nbsp;
	&quot;experimental farm” in Ottawa asking if they had or knew of a
	Hallmore tractor.&nbsp; On my return yesterday from warmer climes,
	there was a telephone message waiting from, and the name was not
	clear, Ron Klingender?&nbsp;(1-866-442-4416).   In short, the museum
	does not have a&nbsp;Hallmore tractor nor had he heard of it.&nbsp;
	Furthermore, he did a preliminary search among folks he knew and
	drew a blank.</p></li>
