  Schools-Full service
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">This is Don&#x27;s reflection on full-service schools, proposing that PEI communities could designate a local high school as an education centre with a Director of Educational Services, extending the school&#x27;s offerings to serve community members beyond students. Don sees this model (operational in Quebec and the USA) as a solution for bringing comprehensive educational support to rural PEI communities like Souris and Wellington.</div>

<p><b>Ref/sch</b></p>
<p><b>Toronto</b></p>
<p><b>Schools, full Service<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>Some time ago, I came across an article about a “full-service school” in or near Toronto; I hadn’t heard the term before.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In effect, they broadened the scope of an existing school and changed it into an education centre.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In addition to the usual public school services, the school day and year was extended and educational services for parents and other community members were added.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Full service schools may be a way to fill some of the education gaps at the community level in PEI. Take any community, Souris, Belfast or Wellington, for example, and it appears that the Premier is the only person with a responsibility to see that people in those communities receive the education services they need. Obviously, schools are there for young people but help for other community members is uncertain.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>It would be easy to designate a local school, likely a high school, as a full-service education centre and appoint the principal as Director of Educational services.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Give a Director a bit of autonomy and accountability and, in one simple move, we provide a community with a person to work on their behalf.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>While I have not researched the idea, a form of community based education centres appears to be in operation in Quebec, maybe in other Provinces, and certainly in the USA.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I’ve had a number of discussions about education with folks in the Souris area recently; when doing so, I ask where people get the information they need to make sound educational decisions. Although the people I talked with know where to get help in meeting their educational needs, I’m not convinced that Souris residents generally know where to turn. A full-service school may be the answer.</p>
