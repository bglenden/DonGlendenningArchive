  Sitting by Nellie
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">This deeply personal essay reveals Don&#x27;s own educational formation through apprenticeship-style learning on his family&#x27;s mixed farm along the Miramichi in New Brunswick. He connects his childhood experience of &quot;sitting by Nellie&quot; (a historical term from English cotton mills for learning through observation) with contemporary work-placement programs. While acknowledging the limitation of absorption-based learning lacking pedagogical intentionality, he expresses gratitude for those who mentored him and reflects on how work placements attempt to capture experiential learning&#x27;s benefits. This piece provides crucial biographical context about Don&#x27;s formative years.</div>

<p><b>Sitting by Nellie</b></p>
<p><b>Altered</b></p>
<p><b>Although we never used the term, it’s probably accurate to say that much of my early education was gained from “sitting by Nellie”.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>No. I’m not talking about a classmate but rather about growing up on a mixed farm on the banks of the Miramichi in New Brunswick and absorbing farm skills, and others, by working beside my older brothers. Sitting by Nellie is not a Miramichi term; it actually arises from the days of child labour in the cotton mills in England where one learned by watching “Nellie” as she tended her loom.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The good part of the experience was the absorption of the plant culture; the downside was that Nellie often lacked the competencies that plant owners hoped would be emulated.</b></p>
<p><b>Today’s work placements for students, I suggest, are an attempt to capture some of the advantages gained from sitting by Nellie.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Too short mostly to absorb the employment culture, they do inject some reality into a student’s educational experience. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b>My thanks to all the “Nellies” who helped me in my education career.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
