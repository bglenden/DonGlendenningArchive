  92- Challenge for Credit
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Don proposes that all schools, colleges, and universities offering courses for credit should allow students to challenge for credit without formal enrollment. Educational institutions already assess prior learning (especially experiential), award advanced standing, and allow some students to skip grades. Don&#x27;s personal experiences include exemption from a foreign language course and direct university entry from Grade 11. His proposal extends these practices universally. He argues this is crucial because society is &quot;driven by credentials&quot; available primarily through educational institutions, yet individuals acquire knowledge outside formal enrollment. Allowing challenge examinations would enable students to validate learning from any source—work experience, self-study, non-traditional training—and obtain essential credentials.</div>

<p>Schools, colleges and universities not only teach those who enroll but they also sort.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That is, these institutions assess what has been learned and certify the student’s level of achievement.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>What is to be learned is grouped into subjects and credits and achievement is measured in a formal way at least twice a year and sometimes more often.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In addition, achievement is measured throughout the school year through assignments, projects and short tests or quizzes. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The end result is that twice a year each student’s achievement on each subject is formally measured and a rating or grade established.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A procedure for assessment and recording results is in place and appears to work smoothly.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Based on the results, credits may be awarded or withheld.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>In addition, some institutions allow selected students to skip grades or take two grades in one year and some offer opportunities for students to enter with advanced standing.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Institutions also assess a student’s prior learning, frequently experiential learning, and may give credit towards a diploma or degree.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Personally, I have experienced the process on a number of occasions.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In one case, I was was excused from taking a foreign language course as a result of my standing on a language proficiency test.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In another instance, I certain entrance requirements to a program of studies based on a comprehensive set of examinations covering a number of subjects.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My son went directly to university from Grade 11 rather than the customary requirement for Grade 12.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>These instances demonstrate, I believe, that educational institutions have both the capacity and flexibility to allow students to challenge fro credit for courses it offers.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>My proposal is that all schools, colleges and university offering courses for credit be required to allow students tot challenge for credit whether or not they have enrolled in or completed courses. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Our society , to a large degree, is driven by credentials which, for the most part, are only available at or through an educational institution.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There is little opportunity for students who do not enroll in that institutions courses to obtain the required credits.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Challenging for credit would allow all students, wherever or whenever they learned, to challenge for credit<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>that are so important for advancing<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>their education or improving their level of certification or level of employment.</p>
