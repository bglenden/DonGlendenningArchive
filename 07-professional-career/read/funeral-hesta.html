<p>Hesta Arletta (Baker) MacDonald</p>
<p>Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island</p>
<p>October 24, 2009</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Today we celebrate the life of Hesta Arletta (Baker) MacDonald, a woman who, in a quiet and unassuming manner, was an icon of motherhood and citizenship in our community. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>One could list the many organizations to which she belonged and the honours and awards received, and the list would be long and impressive.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But Hesta did not join a group just to belong; she joined with others to make the Island a better place to live, work and raise a family.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The causes for which she worked are a good reflection of who she was, of her interests and contributions.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They include:</p>
<p>Working for a new Rural High School in Eldon where she lived</p>
<p>Speaking out on issues of drug use and child abuse,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>building bridges to the Aboriginal Community on PEI,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>advocacy for improved and more accessible public education,</p>
<p>leadership setting directions for Holland College<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Preserving our heritage</p>
<p>Putting on the record,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>memories of earlier times</p>
<p>Establishment of a fund to purchase books for school libraries</p>
<p>And to this list, we must add her church</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I’ve known and worked with Hesta for more than 4 decades, initially as the first elected chair of the Board of Governors of Holland College, later as our Information Officer and for the last two decades, as a friend.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>During the latter period, we had many cups of coffee together and sometimes an actual lunch (although she was a very light eater).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I’d pick her up at her home, (she was always ready on time) and we would go some where we hadn’t been before.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Sometimes we arranged our schedule so that other friends from her Holland College days could join us.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>On reflection, our discussion topics were predictable</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>First was family – she rejoiced in the accomplishments of children and grandchildren and great grandchildren, and sometimes anguished over their current rough spots. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Her love, care, concern and pride always shone through.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Obviously, she was a loving, caring and concerned mother; a love I know that was returned.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Her concern for her extended family reminded me of the same qualities I remember in my mother. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Not all families are so fortunate; these are memories to treasure.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She often recounted visits from family, visits to family, visits to Falmouth or Fredericton, and most recently a wedding in St. John, New Brunswick.</p>
<p>We usually talked briefly about an issue of the day, usually local or national but always from the view of how it should be rather than what was wrong. “There must be some way” was a frequent opening statement</p>
<p>We were of the same vintage so we often reminisced about our early years, for hers in Falmouth and mine in the Miramichi.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We also spoke of our first years of teaching in one-room schools and, of course, we reminisced about Holland College.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Recently we recalled an incident in Niagara Falls while on a tour of Ontario colleges.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Somewhere in our collective archives, we thought, there is a posed photo of some Board members, who shall remain nameless, attempting to push me into the Niagara Gorge while Hesta tries to save me.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Hesta often pulled those she worked with back to high ground.</p>
<p>And always, there was a discussion about education, a subject close to her heart.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She believed that education was a partnership between home and school and she provided great leadership in making that partnership a strong one.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Most recently, our discussions centered on the importance of reading.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She viewed it as the key skill for all later learning.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Our last conversation on this matter was less than a month ago.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Hesta MacDonald listened well; she was soft spoken, knowledgeable, articulate and passionate about many things but especially about family, heritage and young people.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Her story lives on through her family, in her writing and in our memories.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She was kind and generous, had a great sense of humour, acted with great dignity and was held in high regard by all who knew her.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She loved to read, enjoyed family gatherings, was a good visitor enjoyed Sunday drives through the countryside especially to the old homestead in Little Sands.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She usually worked the daily puzzles in the newspaper and did so the day before she died.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And over the years, many a hand was warmed by mittens knitted by Hesta.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As an active church member, she did not preach her values b simply lived them on a daily basis. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Carol and I were out of Province before Thanksgiving.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>On my return, I phoned Hesta to see is she was available for coffee. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My standard “How are you” brought an unusual reply, ”Not very well” <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Obviously, something had changed.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Our community is richer for the life and works of Hesta Macdonald.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>On behalf of the many friends gathered here today, I extend my sympathy to Rebecca, Graeme, Kenneth and Alice, and through them, to all members of their families.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Yesterday, a mutual friend passed along the following saying <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Some people come into our lives quickly and go.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Others stay for a while and leave footprints on our hearts.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And we are never, ever the same.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Hesta MacDonald left imprints on many hearts.</p>
