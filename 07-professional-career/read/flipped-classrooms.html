  Flipped classrooms
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Don&#x27;s analysis of flipped classroom pedagogy emerging circa 2011. Documents example of advanced calculus teacher (Stacey Roshan) using digitally recorded home-viewing lectures to enable classroom discussion. Identifies three keys to success: students completing homework, quality of lessons (depth and methodology), and production quality. Discusses trade-offs between Dr. Scott Morris&#x27;s advice to prioritize content speed over perfection versus Don&#x27;s position that week-by-week delivery demands professional production. Emphasizes importance of engaging delivery: &quot;if a lesson in class isn&#x27;t engaging, you might still hold attention through classroom presence; a boring home lesson faces hundreds of distractions.&quot; Reflects that educators should maintain same quality standards for students as expected from students. Includes references to David Truss, Palmer Academy (Detroit), Promethean, TED talks. Demonstrates Don&#x27;s continued engagement with emerging educational technologies and methodologies in later career.</div>

<p>So instruction becomes about dealing with the holes in student understanding, not giving them the whole enchilada beforehand.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The flip isn’t just about delivering a lesson at home… it’s about a whole (not new, but) different way of teaching &amp; learning too!</p>
<p><b>FLIPPED CLASSROOMS</b></p>
<p>I was introduced to “flipped classrooms” by an article in USA today on Friday, October 11, 2011.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Flipped classrooms wouldn’t be possible without the work of Steve Jobs; coincidentally,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>the idea came to my attention at the time of his death, prematurely at age fifty-six.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Let me tell you more</p>
<p>The article in <b>USA Today</b> tells about a teacher of advanced calculus, Stacey Roshan, who expects her students to view her digitally recorded lectures as home work, and using class time for discussion. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is a significant change in teacher’s<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>jobs, but it offers teachers “greater control of material and more face-time with students.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It certainly is not a panacea nor should it be used exclusively,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>but appears to have potential for some learners, some teachers,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>and for raising exam results.</p>
<p>David Truss, see reference below, identifies three keys to a successful flip, getting students to do their homework, quality of lessons (breadth vs depth and how vs why), and quality of production. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Users of the flipped classroom report the “add-ons” to education being: coaching, trouble shooting, analysis, critical thinking, collaboration,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><b>3. Production Quality</b></p>
<p>Dr. Scott Morris advises, ”The key is to not get too bent out of shape about production quality; just bang it out.  It is more important to get it out there and online than that it be perfect.”</p>
<p>I think that if you are going to produce 1,2 or even 5 of these kinds of lessons in a 13 week course, then Dr. Morris’ advice might be valuable. However, if this is something you are going to do week after week, if it is something that delivers a critical amount of the syllabus, then production quality becomes vitally important.</p>
<p>I also think it’s great that Leanne Kuluski gives advice to, “…embed… funny parts, with jokes and silly accents and things which surprise and amuse her students.”</p>
<p>I’m not saying we have to be entertaining but I am saying that we need to be <i>engaging</i>. Let’s face it, if a lesson in class isn’t engaging, you might still be able to hold a student’s attention by way of them being in your classroom. Producing a boring, uninteresting or bland lesson that you expect a student to watch at home, with a few hundred more distractions than a typical classroom… well, that seems pretty counterproductive to me.</p>
<p>We expect students to produce great work for us, we should do the same for them.</p>

<p>And also contrary to my points below…</p>
<p><span><i>Dr. Scott Morris</i></span><i> advises other teachers considering this approach to not sweat the details.  ”The key is to not get too bent out of shape about production quality; just bang it out.  It is more important to get it out there and online than that it be perfect.”</i></p>
