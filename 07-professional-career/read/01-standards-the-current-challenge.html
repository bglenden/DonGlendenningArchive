  01  Standards - the current challenge
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Don reflects on his leadership journey at Holland College with forty-year perspective. Upon founding Holland College in 1969, he identified institutional flexibility as education&#x27;s most pressing issue, addressing how educational systems had locked themselves into teaching models failing to reflect learning science. He describes Holland College&#x27;s adoption and development of the DACUM model from Nova Scotia NewStart Corporation, valuing its learner-centered approach, relevant competencies, community interaction, cost-effectiveness, performance-based rating, continuing education tools, learner-teacher communication, and flexibility. Writing forty years later, Don identifies exit standards as the urgent contemporary challenge—a gap between public expectations and system delivery. He cites Martin Haberman&#x27;s research on the non-academic gap between school and employment. Don emphasizes the need for performance-based standards with clear exit outcomes, well-defined performance level descriptions, and recognized benchmarks, noting progress but indicating work remains.</div>

<p><b>SCHOOL STANDARDS – 101</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Today’s challenge<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>In 1969, when I became President of the newly-established Holland College, I believed that the most pressing issue in education was that of institutional flexibility.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was my view that educational institutions at all levels had locked themselves into a system of teaching that failed to reflect what we know about learners and learning.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Education systems were bureaucratic, rigid, delivery-centered and time based. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Given a new institution, a young Board of Governors and freedom to act, the College sought out, adopted and further developed a delivery model incorporating a set of beliefs about learning and teaching, program development, evaluation and the role of the learner in the process.</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Our search for a model took us to a number of colleges in Canada and the USA, to Project Poet then operating at a military base in Kingston, Ontario, the TERC model being developed<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>at the Technical Education Research Centre in Cambridge Massachusetts; a competency based project in the Bedford-Stuyvesant area outside New York City, and finally to the Nova Scotia NewStart Corporation in Yarmouth Nova Scotia where we saw the DACUM model under development.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>What we saw in Yarmouth came closest to what we were looking for. We adopted that model because it was learner centered,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>ensured that competencies were relevant, maximized interaction with the employing community, was cost effective, included a performance based rating scale, provided learners with a tool to aid in planning and recording continuing education, strengthened learner-teacher communication and met our need for flexibility. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Forty years later, I am of the view that the most pressing issue in education today is that of exit standards.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A gap exists between what the public expects and what system delivers.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The promise of Outcomes Based Education has been replaced with the reality of curriculum objectives.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>The non-academic gap between school and employment is well-described in an article, </b><span><b>Unemployment Training,</b></span><b> by Martin Haberman in the Phi Delta Kappan of March, 1997.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A recent US report on </b><span><b>Common Core State Standards</b></span><b> and the </b><span><b>Provincial Report Card</b></span><b> released recently in Ontario, address the academic gap but both, in my view, are still works in progress.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If working models exist, they have not come into my view - at least not yet.</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Our current system should be replaced with performance based standards, the essence of which lies in the clarity of exit outcomes to be demonstrated, well-defined descriptions of performance levels and recognized benchmarks.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Progress is being made but more needs to be done, but I’ll leave further comment for my next article.</b></p>
