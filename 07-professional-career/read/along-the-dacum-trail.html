  Along the DACUM Trail
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Personal narrative by Don recounting his involvement in DACUM&#x27;s origins and development (1968-1970s). Describes meeting Robert Adams in Yarmouth, visiting with Howard Clement and Derek Franklin, and Holland College&#x27;s 1970 decision to adopt DACUM for all programs. Clarifies competing BC and Nova Scotia models, credits Adams with competency-based analysis innovation, and positions Holland College as the only institution to fully implement DACUM learning model. Reflects Don&#x27;s central role in a major educational innovation.</div>

<p><b>Along the DACUM Trail</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>In the field of education, the DACUM trail is a short but interesting one.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Still less than fifty years of age, well-travelled, international in scope, still being built and used for a great many purposes., its origin still somewhat shrouded<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>As one who walked the trail even before it was named</p>
<p>Knew the early bulders and was a contributor DACUM trail</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Late in life I decided to revisit the DACUM Trail<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Search of the internet shows how popular it has become.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Many o have left the trail without realizing it still carrying their backpack with the name on it</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>"The DACUM handbook arrived a few days ago.  Thanks.  It certainly documents your process and I appreciate your thoughtfulness in sending me a copy.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Your manual make a couple of  references to the origin of DACUM.  As you may recall, sometime after my retirement from Holland College, I decided to review the origin of DACUM; my interest was in trying to understand how two such different models could have sprung from the same source.  You may want to amend your comments about the period preceding your involvement.  My review included:</p>
<p>My own knowledge of what was happening in the field at the time.<span><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p>Visiting Howard Clement, then retired and living in Victoria, BC,  who worked in the Ottawa office during the 1960-70 period providing support for the various NewStart projects.  <span><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p>Both direct discussion and exchange of information with Derek Franklin  who replaced Clement as head of the BC Curriculum Unit when Clement moved to Ottawa.  Franklin also particiipated in the preparation of the chef training chart in 1968 and led the implementation in BC afterward.<span><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p>Robert Adams, a former colleague and occupational analyst prior to moving to Yarmouth, Nova Scotia.<span><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p>Dr. C. R. Ford, under whom Clement implemented the BC version of DACUM in Zambia.  I distinctly recall a discussion with Ford at a CVA conference in Edmonton, Alberta about his application of DACUM.  It was only then that I began to understand that there were two quite different models operating under the same name.<span><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p>Discussions with, and documents provided by, others with various levels of involvement with New Start Corporations<span><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p>An extensive collection of relevant documents from: Clinton Job Corps; personal access to copies of BC charts in filing cabinets in the Ministrty of Education in Victoria, BC; reports  and document loaned by other NewStart officials<span><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p>My personal knowledge gained from an active involvement at the national level during the period under review.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>As a result, and in brief, I offer the following as it relates to the oriigin and early history of DACUM:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The term, DACUM, did not oriiginate nor was it used, in the Clinton Job Corps project, at least not in the early years.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Newstart Corporation staff visited the Clinton Job Corps and observed students working from a traditional course outline but one laid out on a single sheet of paper.  My recollection is that the Clinton charts were letter or legal size pages in a few basic areas like sewing and communictions, with perhaps 15 to 20 blocks on each.  Each blocks was a traditional curriculum unit but in a chart form and in a sequence roughly equivalent to the order in which they would be taught.  They were modules and not skills or competencies.  The single sheet presentation impressed the visitors.<span><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p>Officials came back to Canada and, as I recall, convened in Toronto in January 1968 where they laid out a chef curriculum using the single page layout that they observed in Clinton  I had a copy of that chart (and may still have it.)   Again, the curriculum blocks were laid out on a single sheet, roughly sequenced but it was not an analysis nor was it competency based. <span><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p>At the close of the day, there was discussion about a name for the process; DACUM was proposed,  and my information is that participants were to provide Clement with their views on the various names proposed.<span><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p>The participants from British Columbia, led by Franklin who was by then Director of the Ministry of Education Curriculum Development Unit, went home and continued their  curriculum development.  The only change they made was to display the modules on a single sheet<span><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p>Robert Adams, the analyist in the group, returned to Yarmouth and started using the single page presentation to display the results of his anaylses.  Adams also added a rating scale.  The only similarity between the two analyses is that both were displayed on a single sheet of paper.  The DACUM as a competency based analysis and learning model came from Novascotia NewStart Corporation.  We had , and the College may stilll have, copies of the final report from Nova Scotia NewStart Corpooration describing the DACUM model developed there.  Adams viewed his workk as analysis, not curriculum and regretted that he did not select a title or anacronym more suoited to the activity.  <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>I moved to Prince Edward Island in late February of 1969.  In the months that followed, Holland College spent  considerable time developing a framework for its approach to learning; the outcome was a  statement of 14 guiding principles.  We then searched for a working model reflecting our philosophy; our search led us to the Technical Education Research Council in Cambridge, Mass.; Project POET operated by the Canadian Armed Forces in Kingston, Ontario; the Bedford Stuysevant area of New York city, a modular approach being developed at Montmorency College in Quebec, a college in Michighan, and probably others. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>A team from the College, including Coffin and myself,  visited Adams in Yarmouth that year, saw DACUM in operation, liked what they saw and invited Adams to lead  in the preparation of some analyses.   In September 1970, all programs at the College were connverted to the DACUM model.  Not only did the College use the DACUM chart, it also implemented the DACUM learning model including the rating scale - the only College I believe ever to do so.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>In the early 1970's, the BC model circulated in Western Canada and the Adams' model in the East.  Gradually the competency based model, as developed by Adams, became the one mose widely implemented and the model that spread world wide.</p>
<p>I am comfortable with my understanding of the development of DACUM; I worked with most of the people involved; gahered information including charts for a number of the early years, discussed the development with  Adams, Clement and other officials, searched filing cabinets in the BC Ministry of Education, etc.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It was great to see Jim and John during their recent visit.  I remember well our first meeting, over a meal as I recall, at an AVA convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.  who would have thaought that it would lead to both lasting friendship and a major innovation in education.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Warmest regards</p>
