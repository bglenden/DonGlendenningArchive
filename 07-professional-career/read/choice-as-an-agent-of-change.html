  CHOICE AS AN AGENT OF CHANGE
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Major essay (May 11, 2014) advocating choice as educational reform mechanism. Don argues individuals differ in experiences, interests, learning styles; choice-making is an important educational skill; individuals should take responsibility for choices; consumer choices drive service improvement. Contrasts limited educational choice with choice available in other sectors (church, professional services). References Bay County (Florida) School Authority 2005 open enrollment example. Proposes four choice dimensions: School choice (location), teacher choice (chemistry between teacher and student), scheduling choice (flexibility in time spent in school), and graduation date choice (based on competency not age). Argues choice removes excuses, increases accountability, and creates window of opportunity for system transformation. Notes Alberta&#x27;s variety of school types (public, private, charter, religious, specialty arts/hockey) all open to residents. Emphasizes that most other services are similarly limited in small communities, so rural constraints shouldn&#x27;t prevent choice. Well-reasoned argument with practical implementation suggestions.</div>

<p><b>CHOICE AS AN AGENT OF CHANGE</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I’m writing this from Panama City Beach, Florida.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The topic arises from an item in this morning’s paper - a half-page advertisement by the Bay County School Authority, which read in part as follows:</p>
<p><i></i><br></p>
<p><i>Where do you want your child to attend school?</i></p>
<p><b><i>School Choice</i></b></p>
<p><i>Open enrolment will be held February 1-28,2005</i></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The advertisement goes on to say that the following must complete a “School Choice Selection Card”:</p>
<p>Parents of children entering kindergarten, 6<sup>th</sup> and 9<sup>th</sup> grade</p>
<p>Parents of children wishing to change schools</p>
<p>Parents of children new to the area</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I thought back to when our children were young and we were purchasing a home; our choices were limited in part because we had to send our children to the nearest school.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Where we lived and where our children went to school should be separate decisions.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I understand that learners today have some choice as to where they attend school and are not as restricted to the schools nearest where they live.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Canadian and US newspapers have been carrying articles on the results in the recent OECD international testing program, and the need to do better. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In the context of that debate, I suggest that we consider increased choice as an agent of change in the educational system.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Freedom to choose is an important right; at the highest level, we favour a system of government that provides a large degree of choice ay the governed as to who will govern – not a perfect system but a good system.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Significant consumer choice, I believe, has a positive effect on suppliers of products and services – and education is a service.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In the retail trade, for example, choice increases the range of products and services available, introduces more competitive pricing, lowers costs and improves service.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Stop and think for a moment, we can choose our church, dentist, lawyer, mechanic, mayor, retail outlet and doctor but we have limited choice of schools our children attend and no choice in their teachers.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Some benefits would accrue, I suggest, if greater choice were available in the education sector.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>In addition to the above, I believe that choice provides a measure of checks and balances on to any system and those checks and balances are the result of individual decisions by hundreds or thousands of consumers as compared to a system where improvement is legislated or imposed by those who govern.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The advertisement raises in my mind the whole question of choice in education; if choice improves our society generally, why not use choice as a way of improving the educational system?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Why not give consumers of educational services an increased voice in the services they use.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Friends say it is impossible for a significant choice option; end of discussion as far as they are concerned.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I counter, “But is it desirable?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The discussion usually ends there.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They dismiss the idea out of hand. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>While there are many potential intervention points, let me suggest four.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>In view of my opening paragraph, choice of schools is a major candidate.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There already exists surplus physical capacity in the system so choice would not likely require the building of additional schools.</p>
<p>Choice of teachers is a natural for consideration.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Difficult if not impossible in small systems but certainly possible where there are a number of teachers teaching the same specialty.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>For choice of teachers to have an impact, it seems to me that we would have to a few more teachers than the system requires and that the impact, if any, has the potential to be felt in the teacher’s earnings. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Could we provide more choice to learners as to how much time they spend in school?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Again, my morning paper of a few days ago indicated that the option of more home study is being considered in the local school system.</p>
<p>Learners learn at their own rate; in effect, some students in a grade perform above grade level while others perform at or below grade level.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This means that many students will have completed grade, and graduation requirements, much earlier than the present system allows.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Why shouldn’t those students be allowed to graduate when they meet the requirements?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Would it be desirable to allow students to take exams when they are ready rather than when the teacher wants to give them?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Why not let a student challenge any exam whether or not they took the classes?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Can we develop a system that removes the emphasis on time and allows any learner to challenge for credit in any subject and at any level?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Of course we can, if we decide it is desirable. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>While schools offer a wide range of subjects and levels, choice is restricted by the entrance requirements of colleges and universities.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My reading reveals little if any, relationship between what is studied in high school and success in college or university.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If this is the case, here is another opportunity for choice?</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I am a believer in giving learners more opportunities to make choices in their education.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Not only should choice be available, it should be promoted.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Having said this, I realize that in small communities will have more limited choices than larger communities.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But most other services are limited as well.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That is the nature of small communities.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In a community with several schools, however, choice should be taken for granted. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Increasing choice in education, I suggest, would remove some excuses by learners for not attending or not progressing,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>(“She doesn’t get along with the teacher.”), would it increase accountability of the one who chooses – the learner.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In some small way, making one choice also increases one’s ability to make other choices; it would also increase the responsibility for outcomes arising from a choice.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The education system was never in a better position to introduce choice; let us not ignore the window of opportunity. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
