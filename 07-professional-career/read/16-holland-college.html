<p><b>DACUM AT HOLLAND COLLEGE</b></p>

<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Holland College, a College of Applied Arts and Technology, was established in Prince Edward Island in 1969 with a mandate to serve all Islanders except those seeking university credit.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Donald Glendenning was contracted as president Designate and his position confirmed when the College Act was proclaimed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Glendenning was committed to implementing a flexible, relevant and student-centred approach to education.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The College opened its doors to students on September 2, 1969 and operated during the first year in a traditional mode. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>During the first year, Glendenning and<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>staff engaged in regular and disciplined discussions about an instructional model for the new institution.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>By early 1970 the following set of principles not only emerged but had significant if not full support: (Figure 8).</b></p>

<p><b>At the same time, the College was searching for a model of curriculum development, program delivery and student management that would support the above beliefs.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The search included a regular reading and monitoring of the literature as well as intelligence<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>gathered through the education system.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Search results included:</b></p>

<p><b>A visit by Lawrence Coffin and Malcolm Lodge, two instructors at the College, to the Canadian Armed Forces school in Kingston, Ontario.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Project POET (Performance Oriented Electronics Training) was designed to allow students to progress at their own pace in each unit of the program; the weakness was that students who finished a unit had to wait until others finished before they could proceed to the next unit.</b></p>
<p><b>Lawrence Coffin visited Montmorency College in Quebec where a cadre of curriculum developers, over a three year period, were developing instructional modules for a new college to open three years later.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The cost was prohibitive for Holland College.</b></p>
<p><b>Glendenning visited the Technical Education Research Centre in Cambridge, Massachusetts to view first hand their competency based work in electromechanical technology.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A team of curriculum developers followed electromechanical technicians with a video camera to document their every action.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The findings were incorporated into three separate documents one for skills required for the entry level, intermediate level and advanced levels.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The cost made this approach prohibitive to Holland College and the format of three separate documents interfered with the natural flow of learning – the spiral curriculum.</b></p>
<p><b>During the summer or<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>fall of 1969, Howard Clement, Technical Support Centre, Canada NewStart Corporations, while on a visit to the Prince Edward Island NewStart Corporation in Montague, PEI, provided Glendenning with some DACUM materials including a copy of a cooking curriculum analysis. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b>In late fall of 1969 or early in 1970 Glendenning, Lawrence Coffin, Henry Purdy</b><span><b>?</b></span><b> and Archie MacFadyen also of Holland College, visited Nova Scotia NewStart in Yarmouth to see firsthand the DACUM model in operation. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Based upon the set of principles identified at the beginning of this chapter, the College soon concluded that the model developed by Nova Scotia NewStart Corporation came closest to the model that the College was seeking.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Adams was invited tto Holland College in March, 1970 to lead the first analysis, that of electronics.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Analyses quickly followed for Secretarial Arts and Commercial Design.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>On September 2, 1970, all new and returning students enrolled under DACUM model. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>1971		Article appeared in CV Journal about Holland College including its commitment to DACUM model.</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>1971		Holland College staff acted as resource people and presenters at meetings, workshops and conferences in other provinces.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>1973		Visit by staff from the Ohio Centre for Research in Vocational Education.</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>1974		DACUM introduced to staff of the Ohio Centre for Research in Vocational Education by Lawrence Coffin from Holland College.</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>1976		Holland College assumed responsibility for all trade, occupational, apprenticeship and adult education on PEI and began converting trade and occupational programs to DACUM model.</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>1976		Holland College instituted a DACUM based training program for its instructional staff.</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>During the years which followed, Holland College staff were frequent speakers and DACUM facilitators for educational institutions and industry, including presentation at local, National and International conferences.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In addition to their activities in Canada the U.S.A., their travels took them to Swaziland, Nigeria, Pakistan, China, New Zealand, Malaysia, the Caribbean, the Philippines and Belize.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>The first DACUM chart developed at Holland College was for the Secretarial Arts Program in March 1970.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This was followed quickly by analyses of Electronics Technology, Commercial Design and Resources Planning.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>From then on, all programs were developed and managed in a DACUM mode.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This event moved DACUM from the domain of curriculum developers and researchers to the reality of an operating educational institution.</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Holland College, the first college to implement the DACUM model, still follows the conceptual model developed by Robert Adams.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>While Holland College adopted the DACUM model developed at Nova Scotia NewStart, the College, like so many other DACUM users, made some adoptions.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Briefly stated, they were:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>(1) 	For each skill identified on the analysis, Holland College prepared a learning guide.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The guide was intended as a road map for a student; learning guides did not include the program content.</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>(2) 	The rating scale was changed to a four level scale.</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>(3)	General Areas of Competence (GAS) were moved from the left to the right side of the chart.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b><b></b></p>
