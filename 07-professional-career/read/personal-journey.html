  Personal Journey
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Don&#x27;s reflective narrative about his career journey. Describes &quot;sandwich education&quot; - 18 years of alternating work and study between high school and final degree across Canada, USA, and England. Career phases: student, teacher, principal, teacher trainer, federal training specialist, college administrator, consultant. Notes influences: Laycock on teaching and learning, A.S. Neal&#x27;s &quot;The Free Child,&quot; Programmed Instruction, DACUM, and recognition that there is a &quot;school system not an education system.&quot; Guiding principle: 90% of students could achieve A grades with more time. Identifies as lateral thinker with diverse roles including curriculum developer and conference speaker. Explains motivation for writing: education is the most important issue, more important than oil reserves or climate change; system is impervious to change and needs external intervention.

<p><b>About my education/insights:</b></p>
<p><b>Sandwich education: 18 year period of working and studying between high school graduation and my final degree, includes study in Canada, USA and England</b></p>
<p><b>Had many roles: student, teacher, principal, college president, consultant, columnist, teacher of teachers, curriculum developer, ran workshops on standard, conference speaker, represented Canada at OECD and UNESCO conferences</b></p>
<p><b>Consider myself a lateral thinker</b></p>

<p><b>Why Now<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b>It has been a lifelong passion</b></p>
<p><b>Most important issue of our time, more important than oil reserves or global warming</b></p>
<p><b>Kind of education we provide will determine to a large extent our future both as individuals and as a country</b></p>
<p><b>Seem to have built a system that is impervious to change.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b>System too bureaucratic, monolithic, conservative, hierarchical, outdated industrial structure.</b></p>
<p><b>People, both inside and outside the system are calling for change</b></p>
<p><b>The climate for change has never been better</b></p>
<p><b>Incapable of changing itself</b></p>

<p><b>Why this book</b></p>

<p><b>In my view:</b></p>
<p><b>I spent my life in education</b></p>
<p><b>It has been a lifelong passion</b></p>
<p><b>Most important issue of our time, more important than oil reserves or global warming</b></p>
<p><b>Kind of education we provide will determine to a large extent our future both as individuals and as a country</b></p>
<p><b>I’ve really only realized recently that we have a school system not an education system</b></p>
<p><b>Seem to have built a system that is impervious to change.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b>System bureaucratic, monolithic, conservative, hierarchical and operates on outdated industrial model</b></p>
<p><b>People, both inside and outside the system are calling for change</b></p>
<p><b>The climate for change has never been better</b></p>
<p><b>There are problems with the school system</b></p>
<p><b>Persistent, chronic; some might say epidemic or even pandemic</b></p>
<p><b>We know better</b></p>
<p><b>We simply have to do some of the things we know<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b>The system is incapable of self correcting<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b>External interventions are required</b></p>
