  03 Teachers as Change Agents
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Don defines teaching fundamentally as helping others change across cognitive, affective, and psychomotor domains. Teachers shape lives and help learners develop new attitudes, skills, and knowledge. Don emphasizes learning is individual—only the learner can learn—and teaching creates change conditions. He reiterates his core principle: &quot;A teacher hasn&#x27;t taught if a learner hasn&#x27;t learned,&quot; applied to each learner. Teachers stimulate learning through varied techniques: modeling, information provision, questioning, timelines, projects, field trips, and performance assessment. The crux of good teaching is creating favorable learning environments for each individual within group settings. Don notes schools organize around academic disciplines with assigned hours and teachers hired accordingly, resulting in report cards with subject ratings disconnected from life roles except future academic study. The essay implies this structure inadequately prepares learners for their actual future roles as individuals, learners, producers, consumers, family members, and citizens. The essay suggests a fundamental need to align schooling structures with adult life role preparation.</div>

<p><b>Teachers as Change Agents</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>To learn is to change; to teach is to help others change.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In educational jargon, changes may be in the cognitive, affective or psychomotor domains.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>More simply put, a person who has learned has new attitudes, skills or information or some combination thereof. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Schools, or at least teachers in schools, help shape lives; they cause and help learners to change behaviour ; under their tutelage, learners gain new and expanded attitudes, skills and knowledge.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The output of schools for each learner is the growth that occurs between entering and leaving the school system – growth attributable to the efforts of teachers.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The clearer we specify the desired exit performance, the more likely learners are to achieve it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The better we describe the difference schools make, the more likely we are to meet our community’s faith in us and their expectation of returns on their investment. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Learning is an individual matter.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Only the learner can learn.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>To help a learner to learn is to help bring about changes in the learner.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The stimulus for learning may be internal or external and the actual learning may take place in a group setting or when the individual is alone.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A teacher does not teach a class; a teacher teaches a number of individuals at the same time in a group setting. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Readers have likely heard the statement “A teacher hasn’t taught if a learner hasn’t learned”.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That statement always brought vigorous discussion in my classes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I believe that to be true but it must be applied to each learner.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A learner has learned only if there is a change of behaviour. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The role of a teacher is to stimulate learning – to create a set of circumstances so that a learner learns the desired behaviour.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Teachers need a variety of techniques in their tool chest – and they will likely require all of them.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Tools include setting an example, providing information, asking questions, setting time lines, assigning projects or home work, organizing field trips and assessing performance.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The trick for each teacher is to create a learning environment for each learner that will end up with each learner having a favorable experience even in a group setting.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Not easy but it is the crux of good teaching.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Teachers organize their teaching activities and strategies around academic disciplines, Language, social studies, science and art to name but a few.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Each discipline is assigned a number of hours and teachers with appropriate backgrounds and in appropriate numbers are hired.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Teachers use a variety of methods to both motivate and teach students assigned to their care such as having students take tests and exams, prepares course papers, participates in discussions and group activities, field trips</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The completion of 12 years of formal schooling is considered a significant achievement and is marked by a significant public event.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>At that time also, each learner is provided with a formal document, a report card, attesting<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>to what has been have learned.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The report card provides a rating on each subject studied.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Neither subjects nor ratings appear to be related to later life roles except, perhaps,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>to that of a continuing student.</p>
