<p><b>A Family Education Advisor</b></p>
<p>It is widely recognized that education is a key factor in determining one’s quality of life; in the same way, the collective education of our citizens will determine to a significant degree the future of our community and country. Because of this, we are among the world leaders in our investment in ensuring that our citizens, especially our youth, have access to a variety of educational activities and experiences. there are significant changes occurring around us that demand some different responses; our education system is unlikely to make the desired changes by itself. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Education is complex, greater than just going to school, there are many choices, each has its own set of consequences, options, Decisions are complex<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Assistance/advice readily available to studentsEducational advice to people not in school is limited and mostly focused on employability<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Nature of our economy allowa people who are innovative to leap to the top, employers looking at other attributes other than formal education, technology allows people to learn from world experts without leaving home<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><span>Education is also complex, even schooling has become complex, and people need help to navigate the system. At least in schools, we have guidance counsellors to provide help; the education system has nothing, however, equivalent to the service of a family doctor for matters of health or a lawyer for matters of law.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p><br></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li7">Education includes all our learning experiences; schooling is an important part but only a part. While schooling is emphasized when entering the labour market, it is the often other parts of one’s education that allow one to flourish.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li7"></li>
  <li class="li7">For people not yet of school age or no longer part of the school system, support for individuals is patchy and focused primarily on finding employment.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Families need help</b></p>
<p>An examination of the education process reveals four distinct steps, Planning, instruction and verification; instruction and verification are obvious; but planning is noticeable by its absence.</p>
<p>Not available, they did not know where to turn, no single advisor as there is in health, justice or.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Individual decisions families need advice</p>
<p>Which courses, which school, which diploma, which qualification, Employers are looking for qualifications</p>
<p>First point of contact</p>
<p>Friends may recall me saying on occasion that education could benefit from having the advice of a “family education advisor”, someone who would serve a role in education similar to that of a family doctor for our health needs.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Operating outside the school system, an advisor would be available to any Islander who needs assistance in making decisions about their education.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Like a family doctor, th educational advisor would<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Recent conversations, however, suggest that every student needs an advocate, someone who has a vested interest in helping student</p>
