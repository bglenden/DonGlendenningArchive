  Souris proposal- Wilmot note
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Letter from Don Glendenning to the Wilmots proposing alternative healthcare workforce initiatives for Souris Hospital. Outlines five options with pragmatic assessments: (1) active recruitment by hospital to high school students; (2) Nurse Practitioner upgrading (unlikely provincial funding); (3) relocation allowance triggered by vacancies; (4) scholarships for third/fourth-year nursing students with employment commitments (chosen path); (5) LPN-to-RN upgrading (requires government/union approval). Don&#x27;s letter demonstrates strategic thinking and realistic assessment of implementation feasibility. Offers to discuss further with Terry Campbell (Souris Hospital) or himself.</div>

<p>Wilmot</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Greetings from Prince Edward Island!</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>A beautiful crisp clear morning with temperature hovering at freezing as of noon.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Further to our discussions with the folks in Souris, I am delighted to convey a brief proposal showing some alternative initiatives in support of health care in the Souris Hospital. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>While all are possible, we feel, some have a greater likelihood of coming to fruition in a reasonable time frame.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Some comments:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The Souris Hospital intends to take a more active role in recruitment generally and promotion to students still in high school. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The Souris area certainly could benefit from an additional Nurse Practitioner and the cost of upgrading may well be manageable.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Once trained, however, the Province would have to create a new position and provide on-going funding.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In our view, it is highly unlikely that the Province would provide this measure of financial support.</p>
<p>A relocation allowance is a definite option but action can only be taken when a vacancy occurs.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When a vacancy occurs, the Hospital must first advertise on PEI,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>if not successful recruitment can occur elsewhere in Canada.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>To have the money available when a vacancy occurs would be ideal, but its actual expenditure must be triggered by an actual vacancy.</p>
<p>Scholarships for students in their third and/or fourth years could easily be added to students now in training on condition that they accept employment in Souris at the completion of their training.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This, in effect, would be a top-up to an existing scholarship arrangement and presents no hiring complications.</p>
<p>Upgrading of an LPN to an RN is possible, and I would say desirable, however, approval would be required from both the government and the appropriate union.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The attached proposal is for your consideration.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Either Terry (: 902-687-7150) or I (902-892-5859) would be delighted to provide further information or discuss the idea further.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Warmest regards</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Don<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
