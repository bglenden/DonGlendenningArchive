<p>Mrs. Mabel Gallant</p>
<p>PO Box 243,</p>
<p>Charlottetown,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>C1A 7K 4</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Dear Mrs. Gallant:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>First let me apologize for the delay in responding.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Although retired, I seemed to have been caught up in a whirlwind of activities lately and am just now responding to my mail.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Although reading is not my specialty, I believe good reading skills are required in all the things we do.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I know that schools are working to improve the levels of reading and I am told that levels are rising, but more needs to be done and done now. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>We know generally that students benefit from a close relationship between the home and the school and this is especially true, I believe with reading.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Students need encouragement and can benefit from conversations about what subjects of interest.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Perhaps picking up the occasional sports or hot rod magazine, depending on his interests, may also encourage him.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Since there is no one teacher of reading, I suggest that you start through a discussion with his teachers.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Some schools have special reading programs for students like your grandson; you should also have a discussion with the Principal.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You should feel as free to talk to a teacher or principal as you would with your doctor about a health problem.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I would also recommend that you talk with the PEI Literacy Alliance. They are located at 161 St. Peters road, the old Ellis Brothers Shopping Centre. (Tel: 902-368-3620).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They may have some ideas and be able to put you in touch with a volunteer tutor.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I commend you for your interest in your grandson’s school studies.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Our education system would benefit if more people like yourself took an active interest in what schools do.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Again, thanks for your letter.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I only wish that I could be more helpful.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Let me know how you make out.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Regards</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Don Glendenning<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
