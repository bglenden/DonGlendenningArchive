<p>April 10, 2003</p>

<p>Dr. Karen Smythe, Registrar,</p>
<p>University of Prince Edward Island</p>
<p>550 University Avenue</p>
<p>Charlottetown PE</p>
<p>C1A 4P3</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Dear Dr. Smythe:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I wish to propose and support the nomination of Mrs. Hesta MacDonald for an Honourary Degree at the University of Prince Edward Island.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>When I arrived on Prince Edward Island some thirty-four years ago, I soon learned of the community involvement of Hesta MacDonald – and that work has continued unabated.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A few months later she was appointed to the Holland College Board of Governors and elected Chair. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Holland College was a new institution, serving a previously unserved population and doing so by a performance based and learner-centered delivery model.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The Board of Governors was key to shaping this new institution, it’s offerings, locations and delivery model.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Hesta was a leader in shaping the College that emerged.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>During her tenure on the Board, she provided encouragement, advice and direction to the work of this new institution. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Our association and friendship has continued ever since.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>For a number of years Hesta served as the Information Officer at Holland College and prepared and edited a number of our publications.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As Information Officer, I found her to be a good ambassador throughout our multi-campus operation.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She was also able to identify areas needing improvement and bring these to the attention of the appropriate people.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>As a mother and housewife, she was interested in her local school and later in the system of education for the Island in general.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Hesta promoted, and was an active member of, the PEI Home and School Association and was, I believe, its founding President.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She later went on to serve on the national body.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>While she had an interest in all aspects of education, she maintained a special interest is the area of abused children.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Her most recent endeavour, at least the ones of which I am aware, is the presidency of the Belfast Historical Society.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Not surprising, under Hesta’s direction, the Society has launched a yearlong series of events to mark the 200<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the landing of the Selkirk Settlers.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>At least one event is planned for each month.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This is a mammoth undertaking for a small organization but I know that it will be a first class event.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It would not have happened without Hesta’s leadership.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Hesta is a writer and a natural storyteller, and has engendered similar interests in family members.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She is a regular contributor to the Senior’s Magazine and edits the Community Reporter for the Community Foundation of Prince Edward Island.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She has written about her family, her community and her youth.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She not only reports on events, she also interprets and draws meaningful conclusions. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Hesta is a low-key person, but with broad experience and great self-confidence.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She knows her own capabilities.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Her comments are thoughtful, measured, and direct.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She knows her own mind and is not afraid to express her view or have a minority opinion.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She is not a person to seek the limelight or a high public profile.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Her objective is to get the job done.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Hesta’s church and family play a very important role in her life.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She believes in, engenders and supports strong family values.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Family bonds are strong.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She played, and continues to play, a leadership role in her church including the building of a new sanctuary.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She also served on the senior church council at an international level.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I have no hesitation is supporting the nomination of Hesta MacDonald.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is a well-deserved honour, she will wear it well and be a good ambassador for the University.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>

<p>President Emeritus</p>
