<p><b>A Home on the Island</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>My appointment as President-designate was announced in early December, 1968. What I did not realize until much later, was that I was not expected to assume the role until summer.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If I was made aware of that, it completely slipped past me.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Immediately after the appointment, I subscribed to the Charlottetown Guardian so that I could monitor events.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I also contacted some real estate agents about available housing.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>During the second week of December, Carol and traveled to Charlottetown by train to secure a home.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We had arranged to meet with Pat Torrens, a real estate agent, on a Saturday, but we encountered a major snow storm, our train was delayed and, as I recall, we did not arrive until Sunday.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I am not sure but think that Pat met us on Sunday and drove us around the city although, it being Sunday, we did not actually inspect any houses.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>It turned out, however, that Pat was also an instructor at the Marine Training Centre, then on the third floor of the old bank on Great George Street, and by Monday was unable to meet us on Monday because of his teaching duties.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We contacted other agents and Stanley Mol picked us up, toured us around. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>How we actually made contact with Wilbur Willis I cannot recall but Wilbur had a house under construction at 6 Johnston Avenue; we settled on it, agreed to some changes in the original plan, and signed papers with Wilbur on Wednesday morning.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Because of the tiring train ride, we decided to fly back to Ottawa and Wilbur delivered us to the airport about noon.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The house would be ready for occupancy by the end of February. Only much later was I made aware of a dispute between Pat and Stanley as to which agent had shown the property first and how the commission would be shared.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Flying on a Dart Herald was not our preferred choice, but in view of our experience by train, opted for air travel anyway.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>On return to Ottawa, we put our house on the market and sold it within a couple of weeks, arranged with the movers and prepared to leave Ottawa.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Although I was in good health, I had some problems with a pilonidal cyst and decided to have it removed in Ottawa before moving to PEI.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Consequently, I spent, as I recall, a couple of nights in the hospital, but I was glad to have the matter taken care of.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Because of that, however, additional burden was placed on Carol’s shoulders for handling details about the sale of our house.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Towards the end of February, our household goods were picked up by the movers; we packed the light personal stuff in our two wheel utility trailer and headed for Charlottetown.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The night before we left, friends dropped by to bid us adieu and as the last ones left, The Saunders handed us a bottle of rye so we could have a relaxing drink the night or two we were on the road.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I wrapped the rye in my pyjamas, put it in my suitcase and carefully stowed in on our trailer where it could be easily retrieved.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We pulled in to a motel in or near Riviere du Loup, had supper, put the youngsters to bed and sat to relax and enjoy a drink of rye.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Imagine my surprise to find the bottle empty.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Apparently the jiggling in the trailer had loosened the bottle top and the rye had been absorbed by my pyjamas.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The long drive and the smell of the rye resulted in a good night's rest anyway.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We may have spent a second night on the road, I cannot recall</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>We arrived at Cape Tormentine in mid afternoon only to see the ferry pulling away from the terminal, however we caught the next ferry and, later booked in to the Islander Motel until our furniture arrived.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>True to his word, our house was ready and a few days later we moved into 6 Johnston Avenue.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Unknown to me, there was a possibility that the new College would be located in Summerside.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Had I known of the possibility, I probably would not have been so hasty in purchasing a home, however, “alls well that ends well.”</p>
