<p><b>	ABSTRACT</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>DACUM is an acronym for either </b><span><b>D</b></span><b>eveloping </b><span><b>A CU</b></span><b>rriculu</b><span><b>M</b></span><b> or Designing A CUrriculuM.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is a Canadian term and a Canadian development.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The acronym is well-known in competency based education and curriculum development.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Its impact is international.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>DACUM is widely practised, highly respected and easily identified.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Surprisingly, however, we know little of its origin.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Although coined only 25 years ago, the origin and development trail in Canada are somewhat obscure.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>During the 1960's, federal and provincial governments provided massive funding to establish and expand vocational training facilities and programs.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>During this period a number of centres, NewStart Corporations, were established to demonstrate new and innovative ways of assisting communities with their social and economic development.</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Within the framework of the NewStart Corporations considerable attention was focused on innovative approaches to training as a component of individual and community development.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Out of the NewStart activity came the concept of DACUM.</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>There are three common views of what constitutes DACUM, namely (1) a way of presenting curriculum, (2) a performance based analysis of a field or occupation, and (3) a model for developing and delivering competency based education.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The first and second views have been implemented widely.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The latter, full implementation, is not widely practised.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Most users of DACUM share one major characteristic - the entire analysis is presented in a single sheet visual format.</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>As a result of the review involved in preparing this document, the writer is satisfied that DACUM can easily be recognized as a significant Canadian contribution to education, especially the philosophy of education that builds a system on a foundation of competencies, outcomes or results.</b></p>
