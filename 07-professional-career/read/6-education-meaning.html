  6 Education, Meaning
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Philosophical exploration of education as concept, encompassing personal development across the lifespan. Defines education as aggregate of experiences that measurably change how people think, feel, believe, and act. Explains that education is multifaceted, occurring anywhere and anytime, and depends on self, family, community, travel, and schools. Includes definitions from international sources including OECD, UNESCO, World Bank, and provincial ministries. Warns again that World Bank identifies &quot;going to school equals education&quot; as problematic in developing countries and PEI. Provides recommendations for PEI to establish common terminology, define education comprehensively, and implement system-wide clarification efforts for meaningful community conversation.</div>

	<p style="margin-left: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
	Life is complex. Citizens come in all
	shapes and sizes; they have different interests, experiences,
	capabilities, purposes and needs. It is said that every citizen
	fills six life roles, that of an individual, family member, citizen,
	student, consumer and producer. Young citizens have much to learn in
	order to navigate and thrive in the life that unfolds; older people
	learn for the same reason but are often just able to start their
	learning from  different place.</p>
	<p style="margin-left: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
	<br />

	</p>
	<p style="margin-left: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
	Education is an umbrella word; our
	education includes all the experiences that have changed us; our
	education is demonstrated by our actions; Our education depends, to
	a large degree, on our experiences at home, in our community,
	through travel, interactions with others, personal exploration and
	experiences that occur in schools. A good education has been
	described as one that provides us with the knowledge, skills.
	attitudes and other attributes needed to deal with circumstances
	that confront us; but there are other definitions as well. An
	educational experience may include changing wht you know, how you
	feel, what you value or what you an do and sometimes aa single
	experience will change all at the same time.</p>
	<p style="margin-left: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
	It is generally  said that:</p>
	<p style="margin-left: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
	•	Learning is a personal matter</p>
	<p style="margin-left: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
	•	Each learner learns at own rate</p>
	<p style="margin-left: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
	•	Groups don’t learn but individuals
	may learn in a group setting</p>

	<p style="margin-left: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
	An education system consists of programs
	and services put in place to organize and deliver education service.
	Typical tools of change include information, instruction; diagnosis,
	counselling, quality control, products and technology but we seem o
	group them together qs schools.</p>
	<p style="margin-left: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
	Schools, like hospitals and spas are
	purpose-built facilities that house the people and services needed
	to support education. Having a well-equipped school is important but
	it is the service that impacts one’s education, not the school.</p>
	<p style="margin-left: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
	Our Department of Education is sending
	mixed messages about its educational interests, services and plans. 
	</p>
	<p style="margin-left: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
	•	It seems to treat education and
	school attendance as though they are one and the same</p>
	<p style="margin-left: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
	•	It gives it’s role as one of
	“developing and   delivering programs”  thereby missing the
	importance of the change process</p>
	<p style="margin-left: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
	•	Purpose of efforts are unclear</p>
	<p style="margin-left: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
	•	Places emphasis on teaching
	traditional subjects</p>
	<p style="margin-left: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
	In fact, most public articles about
	education seem only to deal with school matters. Until we recognize
	the difference and put education on our agenda, we are not likely to
	get the education that Islanders want and need.  Although called a
	Department of Education, its actions are mostly limited to running
	schools, to the teaching function and to the young. The goal, as
	found on the website. of “developing and delivering programs and
	curriculum” is more suitable for a curriculum division than for a
	Department of Education.</p>
	<p style="margin-left: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
	I urge the Department to review, clarify
	and restate its mission, goals, objectives and guiding principles</p>

	Education is complex. On the day we are
	born, we know very little; 20. 40, 60 years late we know a great
	deal. We re able to read, write, speak a second  language, drive a
	car, explain the causes of WW2, construct a building, write a
	letter. explain the events leading up the Washington riot – and
	the list goes on. The change is evident; the difference is due in
	large part to one’s education.</p>

	gather together, it may be simple as a bit of information or as
	complex as understanding the laws of the universe</p>
