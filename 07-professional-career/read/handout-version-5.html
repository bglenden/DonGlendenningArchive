  Handout Version 5
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">This is an evolved version of the educational framework, retitled &quot;A Learning Framework&quot; instead of &quot;An Education Framework.&quot; It incorporates similar foundational content but with refined organization. It presents Don&#x27;s comprehensive philosophy on learning, including key definitions, quality standards based on UNICEF criteria, and PEI-specific needs. The framework expands into detailed sections on typical education functions (leadership, instruction, care, qualifications, transportation, products/technology) and includes additional material on learning levels (primary through tertiary), life roles (individual, family member, citizen, student, producer, consumer), and learner needs. The document reflects Don&#x27;s commitment to comprehensive, holistic education system design that addresses learner needs across all life domains.</div>

<p><b><i>BELIEFS</i></b></p>
<p><b><i></i></b><br></p>
<p>John Dewey once said that if he could only know one thing about a person he would want to know the person’s beliefs; we also believe that beliefs are important and include the following which helped shape our views of education:</p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li38">All people can learn but some may need more time than others.</li>
</ul>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li38">Learning is an individual matter but may occur in a group setting.</li>
  <li class="li38">The most important part of one’s education is the part that occurs in the first six years of life.</li>
  <li class="li38">The purpose of education is to help a person gain attitudes, skills and knowledge that will serve them well for the remainder of their journey.</li>
  <li class="li38">The responsibility for one’s education rests with one’s self.</li>
  <li class="li38">Our future as a community depends, in a large measure, on the nature and level of education of our citizens.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li38">Government’s role is (1) to encourage education among its citizens, (2) to ensure equity in its support and (3) to ensure the future of the community it serves.</li>
  <li class="li38">An education system should be designed to deliver educational services to the extent possible if, as and when needed.</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b><i>THE LEARNER</i></b></p>
<p><b><i></i></b><br></p>
<p>A learner is a person who, for whatever reason, is trying to bring about change in his/her life - trying to change an attitude, gain new knowledge or add to one’s skills.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But learners are neither empty jars nor blank slates; each learner carries three pieces of luggage to every new learning situation:</p>
<p>•	Certain physical, mental and emotional conditions with which the learn was born. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>•	Prior learning, or education, resulting from formal study, home circumstances, travel, state of health, personal interests, culture in which they operate and learning styles</p>
<p>•	Aspirations and<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>imagined future including where one will live, the work one will do and the lifestyle one will have, the nature of the family, quality of life, etc..</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>We are all on the road of life; the road is a metaphor for the experiences .one encounters between birth and death. Differences vary but commonly include: <span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></p>
<p>•	Six life roles or themes that engage us, that of an individual, a family member, a citizen, a student, a consumer and producer.</p>
<p>•	Natural obstacles, restrictions and hurdles such as time, age, personal and family responsibilities, geography, finance,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li9">Obstacles resulting from or even compounded and compromised by people we meet along the way.</li>
</ul>
<p>•	Man-made obstacles that allow or prohibit access to learning opportunities such as an entrance requirement, a qualification, an age level, physical characteristics, level of education, level of wealth, temperament or a credential.</p>
<p>•	Personal baggage unique to each of us.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b><i>HELP NEEDED</i></b></p>
<p>The future we want may require a different mix of attitudes, skills and knowledge than the ones we now have; the process of developing the new mix is called learning; the discernable change that occurs in us as a result of learning is additional education and people who help us learn are called teachers, especially if they are paid to do so.<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Most of us need help in at least some of our new learning experiences; students tell us that they sometimes need:</p>
