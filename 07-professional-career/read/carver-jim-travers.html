<p><span>Orin Carver Scholarship Trust</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>In 1992, the Province of Prince Edward Island established the Orin Carver Scholarship.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>To administer the scholarship, the Province established two committees, one to administer the funds (Annex 1) and the other to select candidates (Annex 2). <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>On August 15, 2000, the Province transferred administration of the Trust to the Community Foundation of Prince Edward Island (Annex 3)</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>As the Foundation gained experience administering the trust agreement, it became evident that some changes to the agreement are required and others would simplify the administration of the Fund.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Consequently, on June 3, 2003, the attached letter (4) was sent to the Minister of Education who was then responsible for the Agreement.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In the meantime responsibility for the Agreement was transferred to the Attorney General’s Department. The requested changes have not been dealt with yet.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I have discussed the Foundation’s interest in changes to the agreement with the Deputy and, during our most recent discussion, offered to expedite the process through providing a draft agreement for his consideration. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>On reflection, I drafted two agreements.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The first provides administration of the Carver scholarship as an “Agency Fund” which means that the Government of Prince Edward Island can withdraw the funds from the foundation at any time. (Annex 5).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The other is our more standard agreement under which the Foundation would administer the Carver Scholarship in perpetuity (Annex 6).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We are comfortable with either but prefer the latter.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>A copy of both agreements will be sent to you electronically.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>We would appreciate your advice on the wording of the agreement and, frankly, any assistance you can give to bring the matter to an early resolution.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Please do not hesitate to let me know if you need further information.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Don Glendenning</p>
<p>Director</p>
