  D 01 Gates
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">This ambitious proposal to a major philanthropic funder (Gates Foundation implied) articulates a comprehensive vision of education system transformation. Don argues that education improvement requires three foundational changes: increased public engagement through unaligned organizations (like those prevalent in health), market-based delivery systems enabling school choice and teacher innovation, and continuous progress models replacing age-based cohort systems. He critiques the current system as bureaucratic, inflexible monopoly failing to accommodate individual learner needs or employ customer service principles. The proposal argues for early childhood as distinct from education, expanded life skills focus, and structural separation of instruction from assessment/credentialing. This document represents Don&#x27;s most ambitious systemic reform articulation.</div>

<p>Potential Funder</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Dear Sir:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>This letter comes to introduce an idea which will exert a long-term positive impact on public education.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In saying this, I refer to the establishment of a mechanism that will increase both public information and public engagement in the education field; I am speaking of a public unaligned organization of the kind so prevalent in the field of health, but practically non-existent in education.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The nature and quality of our education will, to a large extent, determine our future as individuals, communities and countries and, while most countries and education systems, are instituting changes, the changes fail to deal with a number of underlying<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>weaknesses in the system.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I am of the view that the long-term improvement of education requires:</p>
<p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li1">Increased public engagement</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p>Even a cursory examination of education reveals that the system, especially when compared with health, is a cumbersome, bureaucratic, inflexible monopoly than can accommodate individual learner needs only with great difficulty; the concept of good customer relations is a foreign concept. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Sources of information are generally aligned with existing providers of educational services (Home and School, etc<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>) rather than with<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>the sector as a whole.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Educators writing for the public are non-existent, at least in our community, documentaries deal with the operation of schools rather than with teaching and learning,<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li1">A delivery system based on normal market principles</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p>It can be demonstrated that competition or choice in a sector improves both products and service.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>By choice, I refer to the ability to choose ones school, allowing schools to develop specialties such as the arts or sciences, allowing a significant ortion of the education budget “follow the student”, and even allowing teachers to open clinics outside a school. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In addition, teachers’ salaries are based on credentials rather than qualifications and do not acknowledge increased pay for quality teaching.</p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li1">A continuous progress delivery model</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Current model em<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li1">groups</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p>Schools, colleges and universities are teaching institutions, they should Systemfails to differentiate between instructing and sorting -<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>different functions – should be at arms length – confusion between a credential and qualification, Inclusion of sorting as a part of educationFailure to <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Qualifications, sorting</p>
<p><br></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li1">A non-school model of<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>early childhood development<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p>The first few years are crucial to determining one’s future with health care and education being key.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Early childhood is more than preparation for school; it is p[reparation for life.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Because these years are so important, education and health should be considered a single service. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Early Childhood Development is more than pre-school, it is pre-life and as such deserves iit’s own major identification</p>
<p>In the same way that we decided that post secondary education is unique, so should we do the same for early childhood development.</p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li1">More attention to life skills</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p>Philanthropy, Communications, literacy, computer , citizenship,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>All of the above need urgent attention, however, I believe that more and better information and<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>greater engagement of our citizenry is the place to begin.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Consequently, this letter comes this letter comes on behalf of an emerging group of Islanders who want to change the dynamics of education by engaging the public in improving public education.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We propose to:</p>
<p><br></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li1">Increase the range and level of information and opinion available to the public through media releases, public presentations, columns, regular newsletters, <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li1">Encourage and support open and regular public discussion groups in local communities on issues of concern to our citizenry and of importance for educational change.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p>While the initiative is driven by volunteers, we recognize that an organization is required to provide the necessary support</p>
<p>Our focus is on improving education for Islanders of all ages regardless of when, where, or by whom training and education is provided.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It breaks new ground, certainly in PEI, and likely in Canada; as far as we can ascertain, most, if not all existing organizations, are aligned to some element of the school system.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That is not to suggest that they are biased but only that their focus is limited.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We recognize the likelihood, however, that the movement will spread.</p>
<p>In this initiative we are working closely with the Community Foundation of Prince Edward Island.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The Foundation is very supportive and has offered to receive and receipt donations and to provide at least a temporary administrative home.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>To bring about these changes<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>requires a<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>modest measure of financial support; we have set our target at $xx and we invite xx to be a sponsor or, at least, be the lead donor. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I am enclosing a one-page description<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>of<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>the project together with a brief personal resume; should you be interested, I would be delighted to prepare a formal proposal and such additional information as would be useful in the decision making process. You may also find the enclosed copies of a recent letters to the editor of our local paper<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Thank you for your consideration; I look forward to your reply.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
