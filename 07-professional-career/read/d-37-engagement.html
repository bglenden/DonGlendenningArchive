  D 37 Engagement
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">A proposal to engage young Islanders in documenting significant community events and decisions from the past 150 years through interviews with seniors and examination of local records. Objectives include increasing community knowledge and pride, building intergenerational relationships, recognizing community builders, and strengthening communication skills. Don proposes organizing groups in fourteen communities with priority for 14-year-olds (honoring the year 2014). Implementation includes a part-time coordinator and local organizers with honoraria, community group funding for materials and events, and a province-wide gathering to share findings. Reports would be placed in libraries and schools, with originals in provincial archives. This initiative combines educational benefit, intergenerational connection, and community history preservation.</div>

  <li class="li3">Increase the level of pride in community</li>
  <li class="li3">Build positive relationships among community members</li>

  <li class="li3">Help communities recognize their own community builders</li>
  <li class="li3">Strengthen communication skills among participants.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Concept:</b></p>
<p>Engage Island communities in an activity that focuses on their history through a process of identifying key decisions, activities and events in the life of their own community. Information will be gathered mainly from two sources, newspaper reports of the day, records of community organizations, and memories of senior citizens. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Workplan:</b></p>
<p>Communities will be identified, groups will be organized and information gathering begun in the fall of 2013; Community shaping events will identified and priorized, senior citizens interviewed, and reports drafted by Easter.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Reports will be released and presentations made to the community, including local groups and seniors’ residence, in May.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Reports will be finalized in June and reports released.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Organizers of local events will be encouraged to incorporate findings into their other community celebrations during the summer.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>An opportunity will be sought for a province wide gathering in Charlottetown where participants can display their reports and meet an interested public.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Deliverables:</b></p>
<p>Copies of reports will be placed in local school libraries, local branches of the public library.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>While much of the background information will be found in the public domain, it is likely that some will come from family scrapbooks, therefore copies of reports, interview reports and “original” material will be sent to the Provincial archives.</p>
