<p><b>FOREWORD</b><b></b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Competency based education and training has moved from the concept to the implementation stage. Many schools, colleges, business and industry training departments are using or have adopted competency based training techniques.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>One approach being used to deliver competency based training is the DACUM model. This model is not new; its initial development began in the mid 60's. What is new is the move away from traditional education to competency or outcomes based education. The DACUM model is being adopted by training institutions and industrial training departments on a world wide basis.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The need for information on how the DACUM model works is acute. This re-presentation of the DACUM model may be timely and will provide educators and trainers with information on developing and implementing a competency based education system.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>As one who has worked with the DACUM model at Holland College and elsewhere for 25 years, it is a privilege to recommend the reading of this booklet.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It should assist educators and trainers in the development and delivery of competency based training and education.</p>
