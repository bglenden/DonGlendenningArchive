  Issues-7 Education
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">(175 words):**
Don Glendenning presents a detailed analysis of structural issues requiring public dialogue about education&#x27;s future in PEI. He emphasizes that education is fundamentally complex due to learner diversity, and systems require clear purposes, functions, and structures. Key issues: (1) Terminology—educators use single terms for multiple concepts without definitions, conflating education with schooling; (2) Purpose—PEI&#x27;s purpose statements lack detail needed for development and assessment; (3) Structure—failing to organize around identified functions; (4) Autonomy—OECD research shows schools with operational autonomy achieve better PISA results; (5) Accountability—requires defining missions, values, goals, and ensuring transparent communication; (6) Standards and grading—conflicts arise when teachers both teach and grade; competency reporting preferred; (7) Human and social capital—isolated teachers lack collaborative culture. Don advocates moving from product-focused (credentials) to service-focused education, and calls for public engagement in systemic change, extending an invitation to Islanders (June 5, 2023).</div>

<b>It
is widely recognized that education is a key factor in determining
each citizen’s quality of life; in the same way, the collective
education of our citizens will determine to a significant degree the
quality of the communities in which we live. Government support is
justified for two reasons, one to support personal growth and
development for every citizen; the other is to ensure the common
good. Educating is a complex matter made so by the fact that each
person is unique in many ways, unique in basic physical, mental,
emotional make-up; unique in the range and nature of previous
experience, unique in perceived futures, but also unique in terms of
learning pace, style and needs.</b></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><b>An
education system is a set of services put in place by a community to
encourage and support the education of its citizen’s given the
numbers served and the wide range of prior experience, capabilities
and interests of learners, designing and operating an education
system is no easy task. These complexities have given rise to the
following structural issues: </b>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<ol>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
	<b>Terminology
	– Educators are creative people; they try to accommodate a number
	of concepts with a single term. Learning excellence as an example.
	On the other hand, the writer seldom finds definitions in
	educational writings and certainly  is left with the impression that
	going to school, in all its configurations, naturally leads to a
	good education.</b></p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
	<b>Purpose
	– Purpose provides the fundamental reason for establishing an
	organization, a reason for which some-thing is done or created; it
	is also the key element in the structuring process and one from
	which all others follow. To be meaningful, a purpose statement must
	be easy to understand, explain why the work is important, contribute
	to the alignment of activities, and be manageable. While the PEI
	literature carries a variety of purposes with perhaps that of New
	Brunswick being most specific “ My search for the purpose of
	public education in PEI was somewhat inconclusive. 	The PEI
	Administrative Handbook gives the purpose of the PEI Public duction
	system as being (1)“to provide for the development of children,
	(2) the website gives the goal as “develop and deliver high
	quality programs and curriculum in English and French to Island
	children., and (3) a philosophy document proposes to help children
	secure a place in society”.  It is the writer’s view that, while
	these statements are helpful, they lack de-tail required as a basis
	for program development, assessment and reporting.</b></p></li>

	<b>Education
	versus schooling</b></p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
	<b>Structure
	– Educ is a service delivered to individuals but frequently in a
	group setting. Failure to identify education functions and to
	organize accordingly. Typically, the structure of organizations is
	based on the dictum “form follows function” as the basis for of
	the organizational structure. The Department seems to have ignored
	this rule.  As a result, some services have been left out. “form
	follows function” is the usual basis for structuring an
	organization; that’s why purpose is so important. Preparing for
	employment, furthering ones academic studies, knowledge and skills
	of citizenship are frequent purposes. Departments of education need
	leadership in th evarious functions  function a citizens or just to
	be self-sufficient in their future years. The struc-ture of the
	Australian De-partment of Education re-flects a number of live roles
	– childhood development, cit-izenship studies, employ-ment
	preparation  the education task.  Context</b></p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
	<b>Autonomy
	– the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development did a
	study of PISA results from 13 countries and found that  students
	from schools with autonomy in  their day to day operation had better
	PISA results. </b>
	</p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
	<b>Accountability
	– According to Anderson (See below) there are three main types of
	accountability – compliance, adherence to professional norms and
	results. Organizational accountability is about defining an
	organization’s mission, values and goals as well as everyone’s
	role in working towards them; hold-ing yourself, and everyone else, 
	responsible for accom-plishing goals, completing assignments and
	making de-cisions that deliver on ex-pectations;  people resist and
	fail to support what they don’t understand; culture of
	accountability. Start with clarity and set expectations; be goal
	focused, hire the right people, Communicate with transparency. team
	and individual productivity, builds trust and collaboration, helps
	organization perform . Martin Bedard, Montreal Economic Institute,
	tells us that when teachers and principals have greater autonomy and
	accountability, students generally achieve better grades, even when
	standards living are considered.”  Autonomy, it seems, results in
	higher levels of satisfaction among teachers, better serves students
	with different learning styles, the article also points out that the
	high level of pedagogical autonomy in Quebec increased autonomy and
	accountability is sometimes credited with higher levels of
	contributes to their success in national and international tests.</b></p></li>

	<b>Standards
	and grading - There is tension in the application of school
	standards. Some see conflict  when those who teach also grade.
	Emerging preference for simply reporting achievement level on each
	competency demonstratedEstablish a qualification body for the
	purpose certifying individual levels of achievement to persons
	wanting or needing such documentation.  The role of Ieachers is to
	help others learn; when teachers rank their students, they are
		putting their ability to teach at risk. Assigning student grades,
	selecting 	students for prizes and awards and awarding diplomas and
