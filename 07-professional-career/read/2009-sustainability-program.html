<p><b>Community Foundation of Prince Edward Island</b></p>
<p><b>119-121 Queen St, Suite 105</b></p>
<p><b>Charlottetown, PEI<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>C1A 4B3</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>PROPOSED SUSTAINABILITY PROGRAM</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>BACKGROUND</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The Community Foundation of Prince Edward Island (CFPEI) was incorporated in 1993 and has a Revenue Canada charitable tax number (89001 1190 RR 001) and a charitable tax number for the USA. ( 30-0050801).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>CFPEI is one of 140 community foundations in Canada.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It has a Provincial mandate and is governed by 12 Directors from across the Province who are representative of the Island community.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The Foundation is committed to enhancing the quality of life in Prince Edward Island and operates with maximum transparency and public accountability. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Community foundations provide an infrastructure for people with many different charitable interests to make long-term contributions to their communities through the establishment of endowments.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Foundations solicit and accept charitable gifts for the purpose of establishing endowments, pool the funds for investment and management purposes, and make grants, which reflect the wishes of the donors.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A second major focus is to provide leadership and support to other Non-Governmental Organizations including charitable organizations.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is the latter issue being addressed by this proposal.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Need</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>In 2001, the Community Foundation of Prince Edward Island conducted a survey of some 40 community groups and organizations with a view to learning more about their organizational needs.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In response to the survey, organizations identified the following major issues:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>$	Fiscal sustainability</b></p>
<p><b>$	Increasing Community Profile</b></p>
<p><b>$	Volunteer Recruitment and Retention</b></p>
<p><b>$	Board Development</b></p>
<p><b>$	Training and Development</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>Participants in the survey suggested that the Community Foundation of Prince Edward Island could be helpful by:</p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>$	Providing grants to assist organizations with capacity building initiatives</b></p>
<p><b>$	Offering or arranging training and development opportunities</b></p>
<p><b>$	Assisting with board/organizational development activities</b></p>
<p><b>$	Direct provision of technical assistance</b></p>
<p><b>$	Initiating and coordinating activities to increasing profile and visibility, and</b></p>
<p><b>$	Building community capacity.</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Community versus Institutional Capacity Building</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Strengthening the capacity of an institution results in stronger, more focussed and more sustainable institution.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Community capacity building, on the other hand, focuses on the needs of a community and working with all organizations in their collectivity to address community needs and issues. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
