  MISSION 3
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">An expanded exploration of education system missions globally, including statements from Maine, Bangor, Alberta, and other jurisdictions. Glendenning documents that PEI&#x27;s education mission &quot;captures neither the spirit, breadth, significance nor urgency of the education task.&quot; He identifies systemic problems: the department operates in &quot;public instruction&quot; mode rather than educational development, lacks engagement with 21st-century competencies, ignores soft skills, and shows no interest in broader Islander education. His conclusion: PEI&#x27;s government is unclear about what it aims to accomplish through education. He proposes a new mission: &quot;Help Islanders develop knowledge, skills and other attributes needed for life in 21st century&quot; and recommends mission statement development as a valuable staff development activity.</div>

<p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The PEI Department gives its goal as being to “develop and deliver high quality programs and curriculum in English and French to Island children from birth to Grade 12.” Other Provinces describe their work as:</p>

<p>COMMENT</p>
<p>•	Department name includes “education and lifelong learning.”; Isn’t lifelong learning part of education?</p>
<p>•	Should identify functions and services</p>
<p>•	Some definitions would be helpful</p>
<p>•	“Developing and delivering” is a very narrow role for the Department.</p>
<p>•	Focus on youth; who looks after the rest of us?</p>
<p>•	Department documents seem to support the interpretation that getting an<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>education and “going to school” are one and the same</p>
<p>•	A glossary would be helpful</p>
<p>•	To encourage, support and regulate education and education services</p>
