<div class="reader-summary">Comprehensive proposal and background document for creating a competency-based mathematics curriculum map for PEI. Begins with 2013 CFPEI youth survey findings regarding preparedness gaps, followed by Education 20/20&#x27;s multi-year exploration of &quot;basic skills.&quot; Document articulates major concerns: undefined content/levels, economic drag from low skill levels, duplication of remedial teaching, scattered institutional responsibility, and low priority given to basic skills instruction. Proposes using the 1978 &quot;Practical Mathematics&quot; analysis as a foundation and DACUM methodology (developed by Nova Scotia NewStart, pioneered by Holland College) for creating a shared competency framework. Outlines next steps: establish steering committee, review existing analysis, develop rating scales, identify profiles, and develop assessment processes.</div>

In late 2013, The Community
Foundation of Prince Edward Island (CFPEI) undertook a survey of over
200 Island youth to identify issues that directly affect them; the
report, T<u>aking the Pulse
of Island Youth</u>,
available on the Foundation<span lang="en-US">’s</span>
website at <u><a href="http://www.cfpei.ca/">www.cfpei.ca</a>,</u>
provides a snapshot of the findings.  Bright
spots include a positive sense of community, emerging entrepreneurial
spirit, volunteerism and new postsecondary offerings. The main
concerns include a lack of jobs, surviving on low-paying jobs,
educational deficiencies and drug and alcohol addictions.  On the
subject of education and learning, the study reports a high rate of
completion of high school and postsecondary education, a high level
of inclusivity and relatively affordable tuition costs; young people
also  expressed concerns about their readiness for the next stage of
life including:

Following the publication of the
CFPEI Report, Education 20/20 organized six public discussions for
the purpose of informing the community of the report and its
findings, learning more about youth issues in our communities,
exploring issues of education and learning, and to identify actions
to be taken to close gaps.  Discussions were lively and wide ranging,
and carried on well after the formal session ended.   The final
report included a recommendation that.

Education 20/20 has continued its
exploration under the title, “basic skills”, meaning those skills
required of any and all citizens, and considered foundational to all
other learning.  Basic skills are an issue because:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p lang="en-CA" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Content
	and levels are not consistently defined</p></li>
	<li><p lang="en-CA" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Low
	basic skill levels drag down the economy of PEI</p></li>
	<li><p lang="en-CA" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">There
	is an added expense of re-teaching basic skills at the postsecondary
	level.

	<li><p lang="en-CA" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">The
	skill identification process appears to be repeated at each level of
	education

	skills do not appear to be a priority</p></li>
	<li><p lang="en-CA" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">A
	low level of basic skills may not only block entrance to
	postsecondary education but may also lower skill levels of people

<p lang="en-CA" style="margin-bottom: 0.14in"><span lang="en-US">Education
20/20has has searched, without success,  the literature, examined
curriculum materials from a variety of institutions and Provinces and
at various levels, reviewed achievement levels and assessment
procedures for the OECD sponsored PISA assessment, Canada’s PCAP
assessment, TOWES and others, for  a recognized list of competencies
to be learned.  Provinces develop curriculum based on outcomes and,
it is our considered view, that outcomes are too broad a level and do
not lend themselves to common understanding and measurement lack
readily identified assessment criteria ;</span>
the format  of outcomes used  by schools is at odds with the original
as conceived by William Spady and later proponents of Outcomes Based
Education.  An outcome is a clear statement of expectations at the
end of a learning experience; a competency is one form of outcome but
one that focuses more directly on what happens to learners.

<p lang="en-CA" style="margin-bottom: 0.14in"><span lang="en-US">We
have now narrowed our focus to mathematics in the belief that it
carries less cultural baggage, is a key field of student education
for the information age and is of interest to people from a variety
of institutions.  While continuing our search, but with the narrower
focus, b</span>y chance we discovered a
competency based analysis of Practical Mathematics prepared some time
ago for Holland College and the PEI Department of Education and we
propose to use this analysis as a starting place for defining the gap
in mathematics.</p>

Yarmouth, Nova Scotia but pioneered by Holland College in
Charlottetown.  The <span lang="en-US">“map” san serve
many users including teachers to identify what is to be learned,
students to track what has been learned, and curriculum developers as
an analysis of the field, employers to identify the expectations of a
new employee, and credentialing and qualifications bodies in
establishing qualification levels.  </span>Finally,
and absolutely critical to our project, is to develop a rating scale
based on externally referenced criteria for application to the
teaching-learning process.  .
