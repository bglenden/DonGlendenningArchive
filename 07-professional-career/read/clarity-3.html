<div class="reader-summary">Letter-format argument for clear educational purpose in PEI. Contrasts actionable purposes (Alberta&#x27;s &quot;citizens of tomorrow,&quot; New Brunswick&#x27;s &quot;lifelong learner attributes&quot;) with PEI&#x27;s vague &quot;find a place in society,&quot; noting difficulty designing curricula around such abstractions. Proposes community surveys identifying citizen competencies and student assessment against citizenship readiness. Emphasizes that without clear purpose, education system lacks foundation for curriculum decisions, instructional methods, and success measurement. Passionate call for PEI to establish updated educational mission.</div>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Education
is complex, it is also compulsory (at least school attendance is
compulsory).  Learners have different interests, capabilities,
experiences and needs; every Islander is said to fill six life roles
that of a citizen, family member, individual, student, consumer and
producer; education can bolster all these roles. but may require
different approaches. Purpose is key to determining what is taught
and how success is measured. 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Some
examples</p>
<ol>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Alberta
	Education is “preparing citizens of tomorrow”</p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">New
	Brunswick is helping citizens gain “attributes needed to be a
	lifelong learner”</p></li>

	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">PEI
	is helping young people “find a place in society”</p></li>
</ol>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">I
can visualize undertaking a community  survey to identify knowledge
and skills used by citizens in every day work; I can also visualize
assessing a student’s level of preparation to be a citizen.  I must
confess, however, that I would find it difficult to select content to
prepare a student to “secure a place”.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Education
is important to both individual Islanders and to the community in
which  we work. A clear purpose would make a positive contribution to
our education efforts.</p>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Neither
is an adequate base  for building an  education system or measuring
student progress.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">PEI
needs an updated statement as o what it means bt education and what
it hopes to gain by supporting it; only then can we decide what to
teach, when, where and how. Clarity is a first step in improvement.

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Education
is complex.   Learners have different interests, capabilities,
experiences and needs; They also fill a number of life roles, that of
an Individual, family member, citizen, student, consumer and
producer; education is needed or may help with any and all.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Education
is also an umbrella word; a person’s education includes all the
experiences that have changed a life and is demonstrated by our
actions; Our education depends, to a large degree, on our experiences
at home, in our community, through travel, interactions with others,
personal exploration and roles we play in life. A good education has
been described as one that provides a person with the knowledge,
skills. attitudes and other attributes needed to deal with
circumstances that confront us in our- every day lives; but there are
other definitions as well 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"> An
education system consists of programs and services put in place to
organize and deliver education services; typical tools of change
include information, instruction; diagnosis, counselling, quality
control, products and technology. 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Schools
are an important component of any education system; they focus on
instruction.  Attendance is required by law. Like a hospital or spa,
schools are purpose-built facilities that house the people and
services needed to support education. Having a well-equipped school
is important but it is the service that impacts one’s education.  
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">It
is said that education should help us develop the attitudes. skills,
knowledge and other attributes that will allow us to thrive in later
life but, to borrow a phrase from a sister Province, should each
child leave school “having mastered the tools to learn”?</p>
