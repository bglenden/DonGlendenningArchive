<p><b>Schedule A: Activities, Roles and Responsibilities</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Purpose of this Proposed Analysis:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>The CLIENT would like to create a detailed job description for the “citizen’s’ or “everyday” mathematics. </p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Scope of the Analysis:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p>The analysis will include all of the mathematics tasks a citizen undertakes as part of their everyday life. It includes math utilized in entry level, summer or student work that does not require training beyond high school.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Depth of Analysis:</b></p>
<p>This proposal is to complete the DACUM Analysis to the task level. The output will be a DACUM chart which includes all of General Areas of Competence, the tasks in each of these, and the Transversal competencies – those underlying skills, abilities and attributes which contribute to the success of a person performing their tasks.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Optional: It is possible to include Levels of Proficiency in the analysis if there is time. This means identifying, for a specific moment in time or in a learning process, what level of proficiency a practitioner is expected to execute each task at.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Activities:</b></p>
<p>Kathleen (Meg) Savory (the Consultant) proposes to facilitate and prepare the DACUM Analysis. This process will take place September 23 and 24th, 2019.</p>
