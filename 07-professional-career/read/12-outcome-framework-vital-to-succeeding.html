  12 Outcome framework vital to succeeding
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Don discusses recent outcomes-based education conversations with national Sectoral Councils and colleagues. He reports good news: outcomes are universally accepted as the educational design starting point. However, he identifies two critical gaps: need for common outcome terminology and need for an outcomes structure/framework. Using a farm shed-building analogy, Don explains that having clear architectural design before selecting lumber (outcomes) accelerates progress. He connects DACUM (occupational analysis) to broader &quot;life roles&quot; (learner, producer, citizen, family member, consumer), proposing a outcomes hierarchy: life roles, occupation, general competencies, specific competencies, elaborations. He emphasizes that outcome architecture knowledge pays &quot;great dividends.&quot;</div>

<p>Outcome framework vital to succeeding</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>During the past two weeks I have been party to a number of discussions about outcomes-based education and, more especially, about the nature of outcomes.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>One discussion was in the context of the CRSP Project; another was with the chair of one of the national Sectoral Councils; other conversations involved colleagues, both long standing and new, who have a responsibility, experience and a major interest in outcome- or competency-based education, training, standards or performance assessment.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>	The good news is the extent to which outcomes are viewed as the starting point for the design and development of both training programs and performance standards.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>During our discussions, no one questioned outcomes as the place to start.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>	It appears to me that, except for the university sector, the good ship education is trying to set a new course ― a course based on desired outcomes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Although there are many views about how we get there or how we will know when we arrive, none surfaced about the ultimate objective.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Determine need for outcomes structure</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span>	</span>During our discussions, however, two things became quite clear.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The first is the need for some definitions of terms related to outcomes.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>	Having said this, however, I am aware of the jurisdictional propensity to dream up unique terms.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I understand this and am also aware of how quickly terms lose their “freshness” and assume baggage that reduces their acceptability and even their effectiveness.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But work on common terminology, we must.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>	The second observation concerns the need for an outcomes structure.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The importance of such a structure can be related to a construction project which I engaged in last year on my farm.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>	I decided to build a small free-standing shed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I took account of the lay of the land, selected a site and sketched out an appropriate building design.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>	Only after my ultimate design was clearly established did I go to the woods, cut logs, haul them to a sawmill, have them sawed into lumber and, eventually build a shed.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>	Mine was a small and simple structure which, because of previous experience, did not require the services of an architect or draftsperson.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>	My building is now up, has stood the vastitudes of one Island winter.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is sturdy, relatively pleasing to the eye and I expect will last longer than I will.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>	I came away from the discussions on outcomes referred to earlier with the clear impression that, for the most part, we do not have a very clear, and certainly not a common view of the ultimate structure being erected<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>on outcomes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We are spending, it would appear, an enormous amount of time picking over the pieces of lumber (in this case, outcomes) which we obtained from others or have identified ourselves.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>	Browsing through a lumber yard is interesting but if getting on with the job of house building is the objective, we need to know what we are looking for before you start selecting your lumber.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>So it is with outcomes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>An outcome framework would greatly facilitate the process.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>	As many of you know, I have had<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>a long association with the DACUM model and, in that model, a framework is laid out.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>	Practitioners, therefore can move quickly into the process of identifying the outcomes consistent with the framework. But it is only in recent years that I was able to put the different “sized” DACUM outcomes in an even broader context.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>	This resulted from reading about the “life roles” identified in documents from the state of Oregon.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Six life roles were identified: learner, producer, citizen, family member and consumer.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>DACUM is focused on the role of producer.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>	Now I can place DACUM occupational analysis in a broader perspective of life roles.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>	From an outcomes perspective, in descending order, they are life roles, occupation or field, general areas of competence, competencies and elaborations.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>	This is not to suggest that there is only one outcome structure or building design.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It does suggest, however, that if we are going to build a building or build an outcome framework, some knowledge of design is a must.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>For most of us, a little knowledge of outcome architecture would pay great dividends.</p>
