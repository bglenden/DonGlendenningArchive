  D 7 Student advocate
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Dated January 2, 2013, this proposal addresses the gap in educational support services for individuals outside formal schooling. Don advocates for a community-based educational support service with a student advocate position—a professional independent from schools who would help people navigate educational choices and access programs. The service would operate like a &quot;family doctor&quot; for education matters, providing information, counsel, advice, assessment, monitoring, and referral. The advocate would require education experience, occupational background outside education, strong communication skills, and maturity. This innovative model would serve community members of all ages seeking to improve their education.</div>

<p><b>Student advocate</b></p>
<p><b>Background</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li4">Education includes all our learning experiences; schooling is an important part but only a part. While schooling is emphasized when entering the labour market, it is the often other parts of one’s education that allow one to flourish.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li4">Education is also complex, even schooling has become complex, and people need help to navigate the system. At least in schools, we have guidance counsellors to provide help; the education system has nothing, however, equivalent to the service of a family doctor for matters of health or a lawyer for matters of law.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li4">For people not yet of school age or no longer part of the school system, support for individuals is patchy and focused primarily on finding employment.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li4">Another side of the issue is more support for individuals in school but likely to drop out.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Pathways to Education, <span>http://www.pathwaystoeducation.ca/</span>, a project operating in Dartmouth, Nova Scotia, is such a project and deserves examination.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li4">Independent study and challenge for credit</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Purpose:</b> <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li7">Assist individual Islanders of any age to access programs and services needed to meet individual educational objectives. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Proposal:</b></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li4"><span>Develop a community<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>based educational support service</span>Provide assistance to individuals, and perhaps some parents, in the making of educational choice. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li4">The office may well make use of part time staff and even volunteers.</li>
  <li class="li4">Users may include parents of young children; local people wanting to return to school, graduates who realize that they need new skills, and many others.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li4">Serve a community not a school district</li>
  <li class="li4">Provide information and advice about education.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li4">The officer would become the first point of contact for people seeking to improve their education and would work closely with the local schools, adult training programs, and community agencies but not simply be an arm of the local school.</li>
  <li class="li4">Some of these services now exist, however, it seems to me, that they reflect the concerns of providers rather than the interests of individuals.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
</ul>
