</div>

<div class="reader-summary">An incomplete draft exploring Harvard Business School research on degree inflation and skills-based hiring practices.

Notes that PEI employers also require degrees regardless of job requirements. Questions whether this reflects bias, screening convenience, unemployment rates, or retention preferences. Reflects Don&#x27;s concern about the gap between educational credentials and actual workforce needs.</div>

<p>The emphasis, it is said, arises for a number of reasons – degrees adds prestige to the company, are a simple screening device, sometimes reflects high rates of unemployment, people wanting to remain on PEI; potential for company growth and perhaps to give priority to Islanders. Many employers associate degrees with soft<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>skills,</p>
