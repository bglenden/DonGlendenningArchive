<div class="reader-summary">A comparative analysis of departmental roles across Canadian provinces, compiled by Don. Shows PEI defines its role narrowly as delivering &quot;high quality programs and curriculum&quot; while other provinces articulate broader missions: New Brunswick (administration of public education system), Nova Scotia (children&#x27;s education including early years), Newfoundland &amp; Labrador (leadership on child development, care, K-12, libraries, postsecondary), Ontario (policy, funding, curriculum across all levels), Manitoba (equity and social justice), Alberta (enabling effective functioning in work and life), and British Columbia (enabling individual potential and healthy society). Don&#x27;s compilation demonstrates that PEI&#x27;s narrow definition is outlier.</div>
