DACUM Model</b></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><b>Nova
Scotia NewStart Corporation</b></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">The
Nova Scotia NewStart Corporation was set up in 1967 and was intended
to serve Yarmouth, Nova Scotia and the surrounding area.  Its purpose
was to 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
&quot;develop,
through research and experimentation, methods and programs which can
be implemented on a widespread basis to prepare unemployed and
underemployed adults for stable and rewarding employment.&quot; 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">In
early 1968, Robert E Adams was hired as Director of Occupational
Training.  Adams originally from Manitoba, had a Bachelor of Science
Degree from Bradley University in Peoria, Illinois  and had taught
drafting in his home Province.  In the early 1960’s he moved to the
Training Branch of the Department of Labour, later the Department of
Manpower and Immigration, in Ottawa where he, along with Gordon
Brett, led the national initiative to develop occupational and
functional analyses.  The significance of analyses in the national
context is described elsewhere.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">In
this capacity as Director of Occupational Training at the Nova Scotia
NewStart Corporation, Adams would have participated in national
meetings of the Canada NewStart Corporation including the one,
described in an earlier chapter, in which Rice led a group through a
curriculum development session based on the Clinton Job Corps
experience.  Given his experience with analyses, especially
functional analyses, rather than curriculum development, Adams would
have recognized immediately the potential of a single page
presentation fotnat  the approach for the development of occupational
analyses.  
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Analysis
was a standard first step in developing vocational programs.  How
else can one design a relevant training program without first knowing
in considerable detail what was expected of practitioners? 
Fryklund’s Trade and Job Analysis was probably the most widely
recognized textbook on the subject at the time.  In Canada, most, if
not all, designated trades were the subject of a trade analysis used
widely by training institutions as the basis for program planning and
development.  Such analyses, referred to earlier in this book, were
developed nationally by the Training Branch of the Department of
Labour and was a focus of Adams work while in Ottawa.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">On
his return to Nova Scotia from the meeting which gave birth to the
term, DACUM, Adams set about making analyses using group processes
with selected practitioner and Adams as the facilitator.  The result
of his efforts was a single sheet task analysis of an occupation, a
DACUM chart,  with the tasks being identified by people from the
appropriate occupation or field.  Adams acted as a facilitator.  
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">While
Adams continued to operate under DACUM, the model which he developed
is much more than a curriculum development model, he would  be quick
to point out that the chart was not a curriculum although curriculum
could be drawn from it.  
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">As
the following pages will demonstrate, Adams’ work at the Nova
Scotia NewStart Corporation was both significant and groundbreaking;
because of its significance, I have drawn heavily and directly from
the final report of the Corporation and present his ideas using his
own words in the order in which they appear.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">The
Nova Scotia NewStart Corporation completed its mandate in 1975.  The
end-of-project report on DACUM prepared by Adams is still the most
complete document available on the DACUM process.  Adams continued as
a resource person to a number of agencies, including Holland College
and the Nova Scotia Department of Education and other agencies in
Canada and the USA.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><b>WEAKNESSES
IN OCCUPATIONAL TRAINING</b></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Adams
(pp.1-20) made some observations on the circumstances, problems or
weaknesses in occupational training during the period in which DACUM
was developed.  His observations were not the result of an exhaustive
study but rather reflected commonly held views of the day.  These,
according to Adams, typified problems which the DACUM system was
designed to overcome.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">A
	Lack of Programs</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Adams
was struck by the lack of occupational training especially for the
disadvantaged adult.  The training available left many gaps. He
attributed these gaps to actual or perceived jurisdictional gaps as
between high schools, trade schools, apprenticeship and others
training providers.  He also noted the gaps arising because not
enough trained people were required in some occupations with the
resulting inability for institutions to gear up and provide training.
As well, there were gaps due to our geography whereby most training
was only available in larger metropolitan areas.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">A
second cause of gaps results from the &quot;cult of efficient
training&quot;, the urge to over design training in ways that, at the
time, were perceived to be highly efficient.  Frequently training was
not provided because the number of trainees involved would result in
high per trainee costs.  On the other hand, some training programs
were often starved in the name of efficiency.  Furthermore, the
developmental tasks of a training program may seem outrageous for a
small number of potential trainees.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">B	Weaknesses
in Current Programs</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Adams
viewed occupational training as being under a number of significant
pressures which do not apply to mainstream training.  These include
the pressures to conform to traditional views and approaches to
learning, the emphasis on rigid curriculum organization and
sequencing of what is to be taught, the emphasis on group-based
learning, the emphasis on the acquisition of information rather than
its application, the focus of evaluation on the acquisition of
information and concepts, the escalation of course and program entry
requirements, the lack of measures of behaviour change, and the
inhibiting of self direction of individual learners.  Adams also
emphasizes that DACUM based program planning and development greatly
reduces the amount of time required to mount a new program.  It also
allows learners with prior relevant experience, and who are self
directed, to achieve competence in shorter periods of time.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">C	Handicaps
for the Disadvantaged</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">The
focus of Nova Scotia NewStart Corporation was on training for the
disadvantaged and Adams identified some specific weakness in existing
programming which would affect the chances of success of
disadvantaged adults.  These include the &quot;unrealistic level of
stated entrance requirements in the form of prerequisite learning and
achievement&quot;, the frustration of having curriculum stated in
terms of subject matter rather than in terms of readily understood
and meaningful occupational tasks, lack of short term goals as part
of the training process, lack of prior success in school, experience
as a &quot;passenger “in learning, lack of successful experience in
self-direction, inability to relate schooling to real-life
situations, poor motivation and resentment or rebellion against
authorities and structures. 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><b>WHAT
IS DACUM ?</b></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">In
the final report on DACUM-based training at the Nova Scotia NewStart
Corporation, Adams defined DACUM as follows: (Adams p.24)</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
&quot;DACUM
can be defined as a single-sheet skill profile that serves as both a
curriculum plan and an evaluation instrument for occupational
training programs.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
It
is graphic in nature, presenting definitions of the skills of an
entire occupation on this single sheet of paper.  This discourages
treatment of any element of the occupation in isolation.  Stated
differently, it promotes treatment of any element as part of a larger
whole.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
It
is an analysis of an occupation rather than a curriculum evolving
from an analysis. The occupation is sub-divided into General Areas of
competence.  Each is then analyzed to identify each skill it
contains.  The result is independent specification of each of the
skills (behaviours) that collectively enable an individual to perform
competently in the occupation.  These skills are defined quite simply
and are structured independently in small blocks on the chart.  Each
can serve as an independent goal for learning achievement.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
A
DACUM chart contains a rating scale that accommodates evaluations of
skill development achievement for each of the defined skills or
behaviours.  The chart also serves as a record keeping system, as all
ratings of skills are recorded directly on a copy of the DACUM chart
maintained for each trainee.&quot;</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">It
is unfortunate that many DACUM practitioners have limited themselves
to only that part of the model which uses a brainstorming technique
to identify competencies.  But even for this, it is a valuable and
versatile tool.  The full model developed at Nova Scotia NewStart,
however, is much more than that and, in its full implementation, has
great potential.</p>

<b>THE
DACUM CHART</b></p>
<p align="center" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Providers
of occupational training have always used a form of occupational
analysis.  In the early days of &quot;manual training&quot;, it was
based on the Russian or Swedish system.  When the writer studied to
become an industrial arts teacher, Fryklund, Ericson and Friesen were
the common references for analysis and curriculum development. 
Mager's work on instructional objectives was a later influential
development.  This was followed, at least in Canada, by occupational
analyses prepared under the direction of the Technical and Vocational
Training Branch and used by Provinces as a basis for program planning
and development.  
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">At
Nova Scotia NewStart Corporation, the training process began with an
analysis.  The result was a DACUM chart which is the foundation
document of the model wherever it is followed today.  
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
&quot;The
accurate preparation of a DACUM chart is the most important aspect of
developing the program.  As with most programs utilizing behavioural
objectives, the accurate specification of these objectives is
critical.&quot; (Adams p. 43)</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">The
validity of the DACUM analysis process is based on the view that:</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%; text-indent: -0.5in">
 	People
who work in an occupation or field are best able to identify the
skills performed in that field.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%; text-indent: -0.5in">
 	A
committee of people from the occupation or field, with the aid of a
trained facilitator, can identify most if not all of the required
skills in a concentrated period of time.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">The
DACUM analysis differs from conventional approaches in a number of
ways: (Adams pp. 43 - 44)</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%; text-indent: -0.5in">

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">The
preparation of a DACUM chart involves bringing together 10 - 15
people from an occupation or field and, with the aid of a skilled
coordinator, having them identify the skills practiced by people in
that field.  As skills are identified, they are printed on cards
which were fastened to a wall in horizontal rows.  In this way, an
analysis emerges through the efforts and in front of the committee. 
The use of cards makes it easy to add, change, remove or rearrange
skills during the brainstorming process.  A chart presents the skills
in the same words and format as  identified by the committee and
posted on the wall but in a more manageable size.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">A
DACUM chart is a presentation of an analysis.  It displays the tasks
or skills of a field or occupation which have been identified during
the analysis process.  It is not a curriculum but a curriculum can be
selected and developed from it.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><b>COMPONENTS</b></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">The
description which follows, deals with the components of a DACUM
chart, preparation for making a DACUM chart and the chart-making
process.  The objective is to provide an understanding of a DACUM
chart;  it is not to provide a &quot;how-to manual” in DACUM
analysis.  
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">A
DACUM chart may be considered to have four components; general areas
of competence, skills or competencies, rating scale, and profiles.  
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><b>General
Areas of Competence</b></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">General
Areas of Competence (GAC's) are the major divisions into which skills
are organized.  They are logical groupings of the skills in an
occupation or field.  Skills may be considered subdivisions of a GAC
and GAC's may be considered sub-divisions of an occupation or field. 
The number of GAC's will vary from occupation to occupation, however,
the number usually ranges from 8 to 12.  Figure 1 shows the
relationship between GAC's and skills.  The GAC's are located on the
right side of the chart so that a trainee progresses on a skill by
skill basis towards the General Areas of Competence.  The rating
scale is also located to the right.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><b>Skills
or Competencies</b></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">With
GAC's completed, individual competencies can be identified.  Cards
identifying individual skills form horizontal bands on a wall and
each competency can be viewed as a subdivision or component of a GAC.
 A facilitator manages the identification process to ensure that the
occupation is adequately covered.  As the chart is developed, it will
likely become obvious that some skills could fit equally well into
other bands.  In the case of a very small number of skills, the
decision on placement may seem to be a rather arbitrary one.  The
number of skills in an occupation or field varies from chart to
chart, however, a review of many charts suggests an average of from
150 to 200.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><b>Rating
Scale</b></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Adams
is of the view, which the writer shares, that a rating scale should
be an integral component of each DACUM chart.  Because of its
significance, however, it is dealt with in a separate chapter.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><b>Profiles</b></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Once
a chart is prepared, it is possible and frequently desirable to
strike one or more profiles.  A profile involves the identification
of certain skills which form a part or subset of an occupation.  A
profile may even be an occupational classification in its own right.
A profile also notes minimum rating levels. On a chart for the
secretarial field, for instance, one could strike a profile of
receptionist, clerk typist, or secretary.  A company may strike its
own profiles on the chart to clarify its own jobs.  Profiles should
only be struck after an analysis has been completed.</p>

<b>GETTING
READY</b></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Careful
groundwork must be undertaken before an actual chart is developed.
Preparation activities include:</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">1.	Defining
the scope of the occupation or field</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
The
scope of the occupation or field to be analyzed must be carefully
considered before selecting a committee or commencing an analysis.
Too narrow a scope results in defining only a segment of an
occupation; too broad a scope leads to skills being too generalized
with the additional danger of important skills being missed.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">In
selecting a committee, a number of considerations should be taken
into account: (Adams pp. 47 - 48)</p>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Putting
a dozen people together in a room, regardless of how competent and
committed they are, does not guarantee a quality DACUM chart. 
Leadership and a clear understanding of the task are also required. 
An experienced coordinator is a must.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Without
trained leadership, skills may be ill-defined, skills may be missed,
irrelevant skills may be included, and committee members may become
discouraged and drop out before the chart is completed.</p>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">The
physical requirements for making a DACUM chart are both simple and
flexible.  In essence, they consist of a quiet, well lighted room
with a large blank wall, a row of tables and chairs which can be
arranged in a straight line facing the blank wall, a supply of 3 x 5
and 5 x 7 inch index cards and felt pens, some adhesive with which to
attach cards to the wall, and a supply of coffee or juice.

<p align="center" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">The
session begins with a flexible, careful, informal, non-technical
orientation to the DACUM approach.  Beyond this, the basic steps in
the process are : (Adams p.81)</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><b>Establishing
General Areas of Competence</b></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">General
Areas of Competence are &quot;merely logical groupings of all the
skills in the occupation.  Their selection helps the committee in its
later task of identifying skills, organizing them is one fashion, and
making certain that none are overlooked.&quot;.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">The
establishment of the GAC's is a critical step in the analysis
process.  It provides the introduction of committee members to the
analysis process and sets a framework for individual skill
identification.  GAC's are printed on cards, this time 5 x 7 inches,
and are placed on the right hand side of the blank wall in a vertical
line.  Individual skills form horizontal lines leading out from each
GAC.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Typically
General Areas of Competence form around such groupings as
administrative skills, use of tools and equipment, use of test
equipment, analytical problem solving, and communication, but this is
not a deliberate design of the DACUM coordinator.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><b>First
Band</b></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">The
first band for skill identification becomes both a learning exercise
for the committee and a real list of skills of the field or
occupation.  It may be necessary, and it is important, therefore, for
the coordinator to often review the purpose and ground rules of the
analysis process.  Cards are placed on the wall from left to right as
quickly as they are identified; ordering or arranging is a later
step.  It is usually advisable to select as the first band one with
which the Committee seems comfortable and the coordinator believes
will result in a successful experience for the Committee and sets the
stage for a successful chart.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><b>Additional
Bands</b></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Having
completed the first band successfully, the committee now moves on to
another band; it is also defined independently.  While the process is
the same, the nature of the skills to be identified may require
different action words or even quite a different way of thinking. 
The Committee continues its work until all skills in all bands are
identified.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><b>Review</b></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Following
completion of all bands, the Coordinator leads the committee through
a brief process of examining the wording of each skill.  This is done
in order to &quot;improve the quality of definition of each skill.&quot;</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><b>Sequencing</b></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">At
this stage skills in each band should be sequenced and the overall
chart structured.  The committee is asked to imagine that they are
the sole &quot;experts&quot; in this field and have just hired a new,
young, untrained employee.  The task is to sequence the skills in a
band in the order in which they would teach a new employee and have
him or her apply the skills in their daily work.  They are asked to
bear in mind that the employee should be put to work on tasks that
result in a return on investment to the employer.  The skills which
the supervisor would reserve for himself are at one end of the line
and the skills which would be assigned to a new employee are at the
other end of the line.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">A
final scan is made of the entire chart to check the relationship
between the location of skills in the separate bands.  It may be
necessary to relocate a few cards but there should not be a wholesale
reorganization of any band or the chart as a whole.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><b>Final
Agreement</b></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Just
before the committee breaks, the Coordinator should review the chart
in a generalized fashion to solicit agreement that the chart is &quot;a
reasonably accurate description of the occupation, that it is
comprehensive, and that it is accurately structured.&quot;  At this
time the committee may suggest that bands be relocated.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">The
final task for the Committee is to suggest a title for the chart. 
The name should reflect the field analyzed and the tasks identified. 
The names of training courses and programs based on the analysis may
well differ from the name of the field.</p>

<b>RATING
SCALE</b></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Another
unique feature of DACUM is the seven-point performance-based rating
scale which is printed on each DACUM chart.  The criteria and levels
reflect those of the workplace.  Evaluation is of observable
behaviour of the kind that an immediate supervisor would recognize in
a work situation.  The evaluation process is simple, clear, easily
understood by both employer and employee alike and is directly
applicable to trainees preparing to work in an occupation or field.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Traditionally,
school evaluation systems relate only to the acquisition of
information in a school setting.  DACUM evaluation is different; it
is based in the reality of the real life work situation where
application of knowledge, or performance, is the rule.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">A
DACUM chart identifies competencies or skills and the rating scale
includes criteria woven together into a scale which identifies
recognizable levels of performance on any skill.  The rating scale is
rooted in the reality of the workplace through the establishment of a
benchmark - in this case, level 3, which denotes the performance
level of a trained and experienced worker.</p>

OF RATING SCALE</b></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Occupationally-skilled
employers or supervisors typically observe and assess performance in
a very informal yet hard-nosed way.  This is based on the view that:
(Adams p. 198 - 199)</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%; text-indent: -0.5in">
1.	Supervisors
are able to sense their satisfaction or dissatisfaction with a task
being performed. A number of factors may be combined simultaneously,
such as speed with which a task is performed, the quality of the work
that is visible, and the usefulness of the product being built, yet
the good supervisor is able to make judgements about his satisfaction
with performance involving a number of such assessment factors.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%; text-indent: -0.5in">
2.	Supervisors
assess performance by observation, followed by a rather subjective
expert decision or judgement. They seldom administer tests, and, in
other than in the most simple or repetitive jobs, they seldom have an
opportunity to measure performance in terms of production or quality
of product.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%; text-indent: -0.5in">
3.	The
occupationally competent supervisor can tell when a good job is being
done while he observes and monitors work.  In other words, he can
tell a good job when he sees it.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%; text-indent: -0.5in">
4.	The
good supervisor typically avoids making judgements about performance
on the basis of isolated instances.  He has to be shown that the
individual can apply his skills in a variety of situations before
that performance is satisfactory.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%; text-indent: -0.5in">
5.	While
he professes otherwise during curriculum meetings, the good
supervisor seldom makes judgements about ability on the basis of
employee's knowledge.  Again, he has to be shown that the individual
is capable of performing and achieving before he will grant
recognition.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%; text-indent: -0.5in">
6.	The
technically competent supervisor is able to observe and assess mental
problem-solving skill performance not observable by those not expert
in the occupation.  He can detect whether or not, or how well, an
employee is applying design or problem-solving thought process that
are not directly observable in action or not directly visible in the
end product.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%; text-indent: -0.5in">
7.	The
occupationally competent supervisor does not need rigid performance
criteria to assess adequacy of performance.  Adequacy is exhibited in
the speed and quality of application of skill and the results of the
work.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%; text-indent: -0.5in">
8.	The
good supervisor appreciates the fact that most rigid criteria
developed for training programs are not really part of the job.  For
example, few executives are concerned about the typing speed of their
secretaries.  They know when they are satisfied with the speed of
production of a memo, a formal letter, or a project proposal or
brief.  They are little concerned about whether the secretary can
type at 60 or 80 words a minute.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%; text-indent: -0.5in">
9.	Most
supervisors readily express their concern about educational-type
measurement and entry qualifications.  They recognize that there are
some persons who are not able to qualify for entry to the occupation
but who perform reasonably well on the job once they are able to gain
entry.  They realize, too, that there are persons who more than
qualify but who do not seem to be able to produce or fill job
requirements.  Finally, they recognize that there are persons who
minimally qualify but who become outstanding once in the job
environment. &quot;</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">The
DACUM rating scale is based on the view that most workers are judged
on the basis of quality of work, quantity of work which they produce
in a given period (time) and amount of supervision required.  These
are the major criteria; a review of the scale will identify others
mostly for more experienced workers.  These criteria are woven into
the rating scale shown in Figure 2.  The rating scale is applied to
all skills and is interpreted in relation to the occupation or field.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">There
are two distinct approaches to assessing performance.  one is to
identify levels of performance on each skill or competency and,
later, to make a judgement on the level of achievement on the
aggregation of all skills.  The other, and the one adopted in the
DACUM model, is to add the already developed standard DACUM rating
scale.  This rating scale is applied to each skill.</p>

LEVELS</b></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Adams
defined the values of each number on the rating scale as follows: 
(Adam p.28)</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
&quot;The
definition with the value of '3' was established first as a baseline
for measuring occupational skills.  It describes the minimum
performance normally expected in each skill of a minimally qualified
person such as a journeyman in one of the skilled trades.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
The
definition with the value of '0' indicates unsatisfactory
performance.  In other words, the individual is unable to perform
well enough for pay in a work environment.  It covers the person who
has attempted to learn and cannot master the task as well as the
person who has had no opportunity to learn.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
The
definition of the value of '1' is the first level of successful
performance.  It is characteristic of a trainee who is able to
perform the task, but normally cannot achieve it alone.  He may need
help in each new assignment and he may often run into problems that
require expert assistance.  He would normally be expected to perform
only in a work environment where direction and expert assistance are
close at hand and constantly available.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
The
definition of the value of '2' indicates that the individual is
fairly capable of functioning independently in performing the task
and needs only periodic supervision and assistance.  This individual
could be placed in a much larger work environment where a single
supervisor would be on hand to respond to periodic needs of many
individuals.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
The
definition of the value of '4' is for those individuals whose
performance in terms of speed and quality is better than would be
expected at a minimum level of journeyman performance.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
The
definition with a value of '5' is for excellent performance in the
task.  Not only can the individual perform with more than acceptable
speed and workmanship, but he has reached a level that enables him to
solve unique problems in his work with initiative and adaptability. 
This category represents the highest level of technical performance.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
The
definition with the value of '6' is for the top level of employment
in the occupation.  The individual performs exceptionally well and
has the ability to lead others in performing the task.  He is
undoubtedly the type who would be considered for a supervisory or
instructional role in the occupation.&quot;</p>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">A
trainee's progress is recorded directly on the DACUM chart.  This
occurs by entering the rating level directly in the box enclosing the
skill.  An entry rating is enclosed in a diamond; a confirmed rating
is enclosed in a circle.  The date of all ratings is also recorded. 
An example of skill ratings is given in Figure 3.  (Adams p. 33)</p>

must be remembered that the rating scale is employment or industry
based.  It is not a training institution based scale.  All ratings
are consistent with ratings which would be given for the same

is learner/trainee centered and driven.  It is designed to assist
trainees to meet their learning objectives whether to upgrade
existing skill levels, acquire new skills, obtain or enhance specific
skills required for a particular task, to obtain entry into
employment or for certification.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">The
DACUM approach is the first training model known to the writer in
which a flowchart has been prepared to show the progression of the
trainee through the system.  It provides in very clear and precise
terms, the sequence of activities which the learner is likely to

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Instructors
in a DACUM based system operate differently than their colleagues in
a more traditional system. They need a different mix of instructional
skills.

SKILLS</b></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Skills
which are important in traditional system but which are of less
significance in the DACUM system include:  (Adams  128)</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%; text-indent: -0.5in">
(a)	Ability
to handle group presentation.  One of the traditional requirements of
an instructor is the ability to present lectures, demonstrations,
etc., to groups of learners.  Normally required are a good range of
verbal skills and confidence in speaking to a group.  Little group
presentation is applied in the DACUM system.  In most situations it
is discouraged because most DACUM instruction is intended to be
provided on a one-on-one basis or to a very small ad hoc group.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%; text-indent: -0.5in">
(b)	Ability
to prepare and evaluate tests.  One would normally be concerned with
finding persons with at least potential ability to construct a
variety of evaluation instruments.  Often this necessitates a
requirement for prior instructor training in a formal program.  Such
instruments are not used in the DACUM system.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%; text-indent: -0.5in">
(c)	
Ability to organize instruction.  Normally, there is a need to
recruit instructors with ability to plan training programs, establish
instruction sequence, and schedule and organize presentations.  There
is also a concern about the ability to describe these in the form of
curriculum outlines and training plans. Such abilities are usually
developed through formal instructor training.  Again, these abilities
are not required in the DACUM system.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%; text-indent: -0.5in">
(d)	Ability
to write instructional materials.  Conventional programs, especially
those which are information-based, require instructors to prepare a
variety of printed instructional materials suitable for delivery to
groups of learners.  They must be able to write materials that will
either support or fill gaps in available modes of presentation. 
Because of the flexibility of the DACUM system, this is not required.
 The instructor can draw on a variety of sources of information,
hence need not have this kind of technical competence.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

<p align="center" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<b>CHARACTERISTICS
OF INSTRUCTORS</b></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Instructional
staff will likely be a combination of both new and existing staff. 
Many existing staff will have considerable difficulty in &quot;letting
go&quot; of the traditional model and the central role played by the
teacher.  It is not easy, especially if that role has been a
successful one.  In selecting instructional staff, one should look
for: (Adams pp 127 - 128)</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%; text-indent: -0.5in">
(a)	Expertise
in the occupation as indicated by extent of ability to cover the
chart.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%; text-indent: -0.5in">
(b)	Evidence
that the applicant is a &quot;veteran&quot; in the occupation.  This
is not necessarily related to length of time in the occupation.  Some
relatively young persons may be known for their ability to handle a
wide range of assignments.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%; text-indent: -0.5in">
(c)	Responsibility
in the occupation.  In order for the instructor to relate the
requirements to new or developing learners, organize useful learning
experiences, and assess acceptable performance, there should be some
evidence that he was able to handle a responsible position in an
industrial environment demanding the application of much the same
skills.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%; text-indent: -0.5in">
(d)	Capability
in directing the work of others.  Because the DACUM learning
environment replicates or simulates industrial job conditions, many
learning activities should be group or team projects. The instructor
should have demonstrated some ability to lead teams in his prior work
experience.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%; text-indent: -0.5in">
(e)	Imagination
in adapting techniques in occupations.  There should be some evidence
in his industrial work that he is imaginative in applying the skills
or techniques of the occupation to a wide range of tasks.  He will be
required to do this in the learning environment while helping
learners identify applications for skills they desire to acquire. 
Similarly, this expertise will be required in initially identifying
learning activities and in simulating and replicating skills,
projects, and work in the learning environment.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%; text-indent: -0.5in">
(f)	Interest
and ability in developing others on the job.  It is important that
the instructor like to work with people in terms of developing their
skills on the job.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%; text-indent: -0.5in">
(g)	Ability
to assess skill performance.  The instructor would have been in a
position in industry where he was required to make on-the-spot
assessments of skill performance.  Persons with supervisory
experience typically have this ability, as well as persons who have
spent considerable time as members or leaders of project teams.  The
expert in the occupation who usually works alone might be unsuitable
even though he might be theoretically and technically competent.

11.	Select
Printed Materials - is the first step normally taken in developing a
Learning Activity Battery.  Materials are selected on the basis of
their projected value in terms of facilitating learning.  No
materials are included which are not directly related to the skill
identified.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
12.	Develop
Printed Materials - is the process of developing printed materials to
supplement those that are already available.</p>

</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
13.	Select
AV Materials - involves two separate assessments of requirement. 
One, there may be a need to have visual materials available for those
learners who may have reading deficits or may not be attracted to
reading as a method of acquiring information.  Two, specific skills
that require extensive procedures, intricate motions, or the
acquisition of complex concepts may best be learned from audio-visual
materials.  The materials in this category are usually commercially
available. 
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
14.	Develop
Audio-Visual Materials - is the development of materials by
instructional staff.  These may be videotaped demonstrations and
presentations, tape-slide presentations, or audio tapes accompanied
by textbooks or other printed materials.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">

<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
15.	Select
and install Learning Equipment - involves analysis of Learning
Activity Battery resources to determine what equipment and furniture
are required and installing this.  The preceding activities are all
part of establishing the initial program.  The following activities
take place after the first trainees have had an opportunity to cycle
through the steps in the Learning-Evaluation Model.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
16.	Assess
Lack of Achievement - is the obvious starting point in refining the
learning program.  Lack of achievement might be attributed to: 
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%; text-indent: -0.5in">
(a)	Lack
of motivation or specific learning difficulties on the part of
individual trainees.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
	(b)	Ineffectiveness
of resources.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<br />

</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
17.	Evaluate
Resources and Materials - will result where lack of achievement is
attributed to ineffectiveness of resources.  Resources might be
ineffective for a number of reasons:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<br />

</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%; text-indent: -0.5in">
(a)	Learning
activities may be inappropriate or inefficient.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%; text-indent: -1.5in">
		(b)	The
learning environment may not be adequate.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%; text-indent: -1.5in">
		(c)	Necessary
equipment or supplies may not have been made available or may not be
appropriately located to facilitate task achievement.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%; text-indent: -1.5in">
<br />

</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%; text-indent: -1.5in">
		(d)	Materials
in a Learning Activity Battery may be inadequate or insufficient . 
This will be indicated by learner difficulty or frustration while
working with materials.  Materials may need to be added, or removed
because they are confusing or inappropriate.</p>
