  102-3 Role of Gov
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">A revised version of File 17 narrowing focus to the need for public education goal-setting. Don emphasizes that education systems require clear foundational documents and references Robert Mager&#x27;s classic &quot;Setting Instructional Objectives,&quot; asking &quot;If you don&#x27;t know where you&#x27;re going, how will you know when you get there?&quot; Argues that government should initiate this process but with public consultation and independent development rather than bureaucratic control.</div>

<p><b>Re-setting our<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>direction</b></p>
<p><b>	</b></p>
<p><b>An education system is an array of programs and services put in place by a community to encourage and support the education of its citizens. Governments provide support for two reasons; (1) to support the education of jndividual citizens and (2) because communities need skilled people to ensure their viability. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Typical education services include funding, regulation, information,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>counselling, instruction, quality assurance, education products.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b>But there is a gap, some say a widening gap, between services wanted (needed?) by the community and services provided by the education<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>system – problems of structure, mandate and mission, government practices, bureaucracy, autonomy and accountability<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>- and that gap is interfering with both quality of service.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b>The situation calls for action; step one, I suggest, is an overview of what is intended – a public process resulting in a public document setting out of basic beliefs an underlying principles on which our education system will operate.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The initiation of such a document falls naturally to Government; the development of the framework, however, should involve public consultation and independent generation.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b>As I write, I am reminded of a quotation in a book, </b><span><b>Setting Instructional Objective</b></span><b>, popular sixty years ago.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In making the case for cler objectives, the author asks<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“If you don’t know where you’re going, how will you know when you get there?” It’s time, I suggest, for education in PEI to review and restate where “it’s going”</b></p>
<p><b>Sincerely</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
