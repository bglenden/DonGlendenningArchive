<p>Greetings.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>All are well.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A few notes about our family.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>We spent February in North Clearwater Beach, Florida; we like the north<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>beach because there are fewer high rises and no through traffic – although<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>that seems to change each year.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We were near but not on the beach and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>close to public transportation, a library, convenience stores, restaurants, etc. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>It fits our needs and style.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>In October we flew to Denver and, after visiting the city, drove south<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>stopping in Taos and Santa Fe before reaching Brian and Marie in Socorro. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>We had a great visit; first time ever in the Southwest USA during warm<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>weather.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Brian and Marie have a lovely large home and, given the good<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>weather, we were comfortable to limit ourselves to day trips.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Brian and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Marie took some time off - and Brian and I actually built a house for the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>family cat.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Our trip also included a family gathering in Santa Fe in October – sort of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>a belated birthday party for Carol. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We had a great evening; Janet was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>New Mexico for a visit so we overlapped with her for a family dinner. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Our granddaughter, Lisa, finished university and is working and Laura</p>
<p>finishes this year.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Earlier this year, Holland College, where I worked for 18 years, opened</p>
<p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>a new 96-bed residence and honoured me by naming it Glendenning Hall.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Carol and I keep well and busy.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We read, travel and garden; Carol loves</p>
<p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>her bridge and I still do some genealogy.</p>
