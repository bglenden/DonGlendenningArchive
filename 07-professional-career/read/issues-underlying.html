  Issues underlying
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Don&#x27;s critical analysis of systemic issues causing turmoil in education. Major problems identified: ambiguity (called &quot;Education&quot; but only operates schools), lack of user choice (providers control what/when/where/why/how), absence of family educational advocates, teacher pay based on knowledge not performance, quality variable while time constant, politicization through government operation, unclear roles for educators, lack of incentives for improvement, HR development gaps, formula-driven budgeting, poor customer service. Argues education narrows vision, leaves some unserved, focuses on subject knowledge over development. This represents Don&#x27;s foundational critique of provincial education system dysfunction.</div>

<p><b>Underlying Issues</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>People often ask about, or comment upon, the constant turmoil in education; it’s a subject worthy of study, not just comment.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It has been a topic of conversation recently and my conclusion is that much of the turmoil stems from the fact that organized education flouts a number of every day norms.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Here are examples.</p>
<p><br></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li6"><b>Ambiguity</b>: Calls itself Department of Education but they only run schools; not clear whether it is providing a service or a product</li>
  <li class="li6"><b>Choice</b>:<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The what, when, where, why. and how of education are mostly determined by the provider of educational rather than the user of the services,</li>
  <li class="li6">Absence of a family advocates: Most families, it seems, have advisors to call on for help, a doctor, lawyer, clergyman, accountant or a banker; we have no equivalent for advice about education.</li>
  <li class="li6"><b>Remuneration:</b><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Most people are paid for what they do; teachers, it seems, are paid for what they know.</li>
  <li class="li6"><b>Quality</b>: Time: constant with quality: variable</li>
  <li class="li6"><b>Autonomy:</b> The fact that schools are run directly by a government politicizes most discussion of educational issues</li>
  <li class="li6">Roles and expectations of front line deliverers of educational services are not clear</li>
