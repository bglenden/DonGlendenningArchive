<p>POINTS OF VIEW</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>By the mid-1980's, DACUM, or at least the analysis component, had wide application throughout Canada and the United States of America.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Since then, its use has become international. Following are some comments by people who are familiar with the DACUM model.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>1.	In 1986, Adrienne Burleigh from New Zealand visited the USA, Canada and a number of other countries and concluded:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>"DACUM has widespread and growing use throughout both Canada and the United States of America. While the application of DACUM demonstrates small local variations, the concepts outlined by Adams have been adhered to and, in all cases, the tenets that underpin the DACUM process are instantly recognizable in all situations."<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>2.	Macklin, in his Masters' thesis at Simon Fraser University, concluded that "... DACUM still stands, unchallenged, as the pioneer curriculum development system for competency-based<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>vocational training".</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>3.	Robert Norton of the National Centre for Research in Vocational Education, Ohio,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>wrote:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>“DACUM or "Developing a Curriculum" is a relatively new and innovative approach to occupational analysis.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It has proven to be a very effective method of quickly determining, at relatively low cost, the tasks that must be performed by persons employed in a given job or occupational area." (p 1)</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>"DACUM is an occupational analysis procedure that has experienced remarkable success in a relatively short period of time in both Canada and the United States.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Because its structure and procedures allow occupational duty and task statements to be identified (1) effectively, (2) quickly, and (3) at a very low cost, DACUM has become closely associated with the movement toward competency-based education(CBE).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In addition, the DACUM process has a number of characteristics and qualities that are greatly needed in CBE if it is to become a practical alternative to traditional vocational education." <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>4.	Donald Glendenning, the Founding President of Holland College wrote in a Canadian Vocational Journal:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>"DACUM is fast becoming a world model for analyzing an occupation.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The result of a DACUM analysis is a descriptive identification of the skills required of a person who works in that occupation. ... DACUM is effective because it takes only two or three days to complete an occupational analysis, it is highly valid because it uses experts/practitioners from the occupation and it is cost-effective because it accomplishes in two or three days what other methods take two weeks to do."</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>5.	Charles Joyner, in Challenge and Opportunity (3), says:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>"The DACUM technique for developing curriculum and the application of competency based education (CBE) methodology are Canadian innovations, now shared with many nations seeking solutions to the continuing challenge of providing education and training opportunities relevant<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>to the needs of society."</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>6.	Norton, Robert E., in an presentation on "DACUM Quality - Effectiveness, Efficiency and Validity", in Orlando, Florida on November 29, 1989 said:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>"DACUM is, compared with the task inventory, more efficient".</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>7.	Capp, Laura L. "Florida College is Sold on DACUM", <span>East Central Communique</span>, Springfield, Illinois: East Central Network for Curriculum Coordination, Vol. 11 Issue 2, 1984</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>"I am proud to sign a competency chart because I am confident that the learner really can perform the occupation skills' That is a typical comment by an instructor using DACUM.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>At Seminole community College in Central Florida the 14 instructors who have experienced DACUM are pleased with the results."</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>8.	Hesse and Nijhof, 1989 say:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>“The quality of DACUM is dependent on the verbal interaction.”</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>9.	Robert Norton, Center on Education and Training for Employment, Ohio,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>writes in “the DACUM connection”:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>In different parts of the world, the DACUM process is being used - as it is in this country - for a wide variety of uses, including curriculum development, review, revision, and articulation; training needs assessments; competency test development; worker performance evaluations; student recruitment, counselling, and record-keeping; training program review; Tech Prep and career program development; and job descriptions and modifications.”</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>10.	Lawrence Coffin <span class="Apple-converted-space"> 							</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>“During the past ten years, the DACUM model of analysis has proven to be a very reliable tool in a variety of applications dealing with HRD issues.”</p>
<p><br></p>
