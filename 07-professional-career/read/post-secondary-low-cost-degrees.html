<div class="reader-summary">Tamar Lewin reports on Texas and Florida initiatives to create $10,000 bachelor&#x27;s degrees as a response to escalating costs and student debt. Governor Rick Perry and Rick Scott launched programs to challenge universities to develop efficient degree programs using online learning and new pedagogies. Early results show limited uptake: Broward College offered low-cost degrees in only four specialized programs with 80-student target, while Miami Dade drew 62 students. Article notes most programs involve &quot;re-pricing&quot; rather than fundamental redesign, and federal/state aid means most students already pay under $10,000.</div>

<p>Low-Cost B.A. Starting Slowly in Two States</p>
<p>By TAMAR LEWIN</p>
<p>Published: October 18, 2013<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. — With tuition, student loan debt and default rates all spiraling higher, what’s not to love about a $10,000 bachelor’s degree?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>John Van Beekum for The New York Times</p>
<p>Maggie Biegelsen and Luis Santiago, at Broward College in Davie, Fla., want to teach math.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>In the last two years, two Republican governors — Rick Perry in Texas and Rick Scott in Florida — have challenged their states’ public colleges to develop bachelor’s degrees costing no more than $10,000, less than a third of the average sticker price for tuition and fees at a four-year public college. Governor Perry said he hoped 10 percent of the state’s degrees would meet that goal with online learning and new efficiencies. Governor Scott sought low-cost degrees in high-demand fields.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Democrats were critical of both announcements, calling the idea a gimmick that would lead to a watered down “Walmartization” of higher education. Meanwhile, in California, a Republican legislator has called for a pilot program there.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Now the $10,000 degrees are available in Florida and Texas — but not for many students, not for many majors and not on the flagship campuses. The original goal was that the degrees would use new teaching techniques and technologies to bring down costs; so far, many of the programs are unchanged.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>In Florida, the two dozen former community colleges that offer both associate and baccalaureate degrees all volunteered to meet the $10,000 challenge, but several programs are not yet under way. The state universities are not in the program.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Broward College, which has 67,000 students, is offering the low-cost baccalaureate in its four smallest bachelor’s programs — middle-school math education, middle-school science education, information technology, and global trade and logistics — and seeking a total of 80 students. Even that may be a stretch.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>To qualify, students must have a grade-point average of at least 3.0 and be Florida residents, in college for the first time, and committed to continuous enrollment. But most Broward students drop out before completing a two-year degree. And among those who earn an associate degree, many transfer for their final two years, or have no interest in the targeted majors.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>“This isn’t going to be for the masses,” said J. David Armstrong, Broward’s president, adding that it would be impossible to offer thousands of low-cost degrees unless the state funded the program.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Broward designed its programs to confront the dropout problem that plagues community colleges nationwide. Posters on campus exhort students to “Finish What You Start,” and to that end, the savings in the affordable degree programs will come in the form of a free last semester. (Broward received no extra money for the program and is paying for it with pre-existing tuition waivers.)<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>“I know some places are using front-end incentives, but we’re using the money as a carrot at the back end, to incent students to complete,” Mr. Armstrong said.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Randy Hanna, the chancellor of the Florida College System, said that whatever the numbers, the program is an important addition to the system’s efforts to promote college access.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>In fact, the Florida system is already among the cheapest in the nation, with tuition and fees averaging $13,264 for a four-year degree.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Miami Dade College, the biggest in the system, is offering eight $10,000 bachelor’s degree programs to students who graduate from a local high school, enroll full-time and have a grade-point average of at least 3.0. So far, they have drawn 62 students.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Despite the governors’ calls for new efficiencies, most of the affordable programs, at least so far, involve re-pricing — but not rethinking — degree programs, according to Daniel J. Hurley, a policy analyst at the American Association of State Colleges and Universities. Furthermore, he said, whatever the official price, once federal and state aid is taken into account, most students at the Florida colleges already end up paying less than $10,000 for their degrees.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Nationally, tuition and fees at a public university cost in-state students about $9,000 a year, or $36,000 for a four-year degree. Private universities’ average tuition is $30,000 a year, or $120,000 for a degree. Room and board add about another $9,000 a year.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
