<p>“My conviction is that we must do now what we should have done 20 years ago; that is, imagine that we have no national structure in place, start from scratch<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>and design a structure that will meet the realities of today and stop trying to fit a round peg into a square hole by rearranging things …” Presbyterian Record<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p><b>ABOUT SCHOOLS</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>John Dewey, in </b><span><b>School and Society,</b></span><b> said “Relate the school to life, and all studies are of necessity correlated”.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In spite of this advice,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>schools operate on a model far different from the world outside their doors. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Dewey’s “life” may be interpreted or described many ways.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I like the model put forward in the Oregon Education Act of 1991 which identified the following life roles: individual, learner, producer, consumer, family member and citizen. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Although the significance of each role varies from individual to individual and changes as we mature, we all want our children to reach an acceptable level of performance in each role.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But helping our youth prepare for each role is more than most parents can handle so we’ve established schools.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The community thinks education is a such a good thing that taxpayers foot the bill. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>In our lifetime, everything seemed to work well.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>People who went to school or stayed in school for longer periods found jobs and earned more money.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This worked so well that the government built more and bigger schools.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The offer to help became a requirement to attend.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Schools have taken on a life of their own. Both people and the school became convinced that going to school and getting an education meant the same thing. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span></b></p>
<p><b>In the real world, became a place of change, and the pace also increases; schools didn’t seem to notice.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>People in the real world work differently, in different places, with different tools and within changing organizational patterns.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But not schools, they<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>continue to focus on doing the same thing but doing it better and better. The output of schools for each learner is the growth that is attributable to interventions made by school employees – teachers, librarians, guidance counselors, etc.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The clearer we specify the desired exit performance, the more likely learners are to achieve it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The better we describe the difference schools make, the more likely we are to meet our community’s expectation and of the return on their investment.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The ultimate objective is to prepare young people to function in adult roles. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>The above being the case, schools should look to the community when they plan school programs.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>What mix of life roles should a school offer?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>What attitudes, skills and knowledge will best serve learners both while in school and in later life? What are the community norms? How do schools organize for the task?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b>Schools offer a safe and controlled environment to experiment, to try new things, even to fail.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Society has placed few restrictions on what schools can or should do but neither has it described well its expectations.</b></p>
