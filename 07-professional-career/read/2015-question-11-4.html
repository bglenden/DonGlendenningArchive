will be considered illiterate without having the ability to code.  
Learning to code involves mathematics, logic and algorithms and

webinars, especially on basic concepts and principles.  we plan to
address that need through a series of web-based video clips as part
of our “framework for change”  on such topics as role of schools,
working definitions, a learning model, a teaching model, elements of
an education system, etc.  We expect clips to be from 3-5 minutes

</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">About a year ago,
the Community Foundation of Prince Edward Island conducted a survey
of over 200 young people to better understand their issues. 
(<u><a href="http://www.CFPEI.ca/">www.CFPEI.ca</a></u>).
 On reviewing their report, Education 20/20 was struck by the
“preparedness gap”, that is the preparedness of young people for
further education and for work.   Early in 2014, Education 20/20 Inc.
organized workshops in six communities across the Island to publicize
the findings, determine the extent of the concern,  and identify
actions, if any, that could or should be taken. Perhaps the most
significant finding was the lack of communication about educational
matters between providers and users of educational services.  (A copy
of the report is attached). Survey results have informed two program
activities:

	citizens has to address the preparedness issue and, in particular

	school marks as a measure of math levels of job applicants. system
	to better define levels of achievement; at the moment, the focus of
	assessment and reporting is on ranking.  We will be proposing a
	system similar to that practiced in music whereby the establishment
	of levels is handled by the Royal Canadian Conservatory of Music
	rather than local teachers of music</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Hosting a
	series of discussions between educators and the public they serve. 
	Each session will have a one page background paper, a  presentation
	if appropriate afollowed by open discussion.  The objective is to
	increase communications rather than to reach agreement.  The pilot
	run of discussions will begin in early 2015 between 4:30 and 6:00 pm
	with a group not to exceed 20 people.

	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Including nd
	employers to increase communication such as bringing them together
	on projects and education workshop panels; we will also contact
	service clubs encouraging them to invite educators, especially
	principals, as speakers, and will make a special attempt to produce
