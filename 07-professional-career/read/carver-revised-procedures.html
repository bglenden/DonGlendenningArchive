<p>Alan Buchanan, Registrar</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Orin Carver Scholarship </b><br>
</p>
<p>This is a follow-p to our discussions about the administration of the Orin Carver Scholarship.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The current arrangement for administering the agreement is for applications to be sent to UPEI.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Following the closing day, applications are bundled together by UPEI and sent to The Community Foundation following which, in consultation with Gordon, Chair of the Selection committee, applications are copied, and a date set for the committee to meet , review and select.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Once the selection is made, the Foundation informs the successful candidate, issues a cheque and, usually at a later date, publicizes the award as part of our awards ceremony.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>We all agree that the handling of applications by the University is an added step which can and should be eliminated.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We also want to ensure that students are safeguarded during the changeover.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Consequently, and effective immediately, I propose that:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Both the Foundation and the University distribute brochures, posters and applications as in previous years. (I realize that there may be some overlap but better that than to miss someone)</p>
<p>Before doing so, however, that the return address on each be changed from UPEI to the Community Foundation</p>
<p>That the Registrar of Holland College be briefed about these changes.</p>
<p>Applications received by UPEI or Holland College be forwarded immediately to the community foundation.</p>
<p>At the end of this term, surplus brochures, applications and posters be forwarded to the Foundation for distribution in future years.</p>
<p>Addresses be changed when supplies are being reprinted.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I believe that these changes reflect our discussions; if not, please let me know immediately.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Don Glendenning</p>
<p>Director</p>
