  2008-6 Living Trust
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">A comprehensive February 5, 2008 proposal for the Living Memorial Trust environmental initiative. Don documents partnership with the Keuper Family to establish tree-planting sites across PEI, with donations supporting both immediate planting and permanent endowments. His detailed plan includes specific funding levels ($25 minimum donation, $100 for endowment, $250 for plaques), site selection criteria, partnership structures, and promotional strategies. This demonstrates Don&#x27;s passion for environmental stewardship, community partnerships, and creative fundraising that connects emotional values (memorials, special occasions) with conservation goals.</div>

<p><b>COMMUNITY FOUNDATION OF PRINCE EDWARD ISLAND</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>SD-		2008-6</b></p>
<p><b>Date:		February 5, 2008	</b></p>
<p><b>Prepared by:	Don Glendenning</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>To:		Executive</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Subject:	Living Trust</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The Living Memorial Trust was established on the initiative of the Keuper Family; its purpose is to protect, expand and improve the “greening’ of public spaces in PEI.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The inaugural planting took place in 2007 through the planting of a cluster of three oak trees on each side of the Wood Islands entrance to Trails PEI.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Jeniene Peake, Donnie and I constitute a small committee to move the initiative forward including the development of guidelines for future plantings and actual planting in 2008.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Our plan is to turn the initiative over to the Granting Committee before yearend..</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Our current thinking is as follows:</p>
<p>To quickly designate one site per county for planting trees; each site will have two areas one for general planting and another for named trees.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Eventually there may be 10, 20 or even more such sites on PEI<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We will use these sites as part of our promotion but planting will likely not occur in all sites in any year.</p>
<p>We see Trails PEI as natural locations especially for initial plantings.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Based on last years experience and our discussion, ideally we would plant a cluster of three oak trees on each side of a trail entrance and somewhere close by have a spot for both general planting of unnamed trees and another for the planting of named trees.</p>
<p>Native species will be planted, likely with the trees at the entrance being Island Oak.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This should make for easy identification of entrances.</p>
<p>It is our hope that we can continue the partnership of last year, Transportation and Public Works, Trails PEI, Forestry, McPhail Woods, John Keuper and others in the initiative..</p>
<p>Planting at designated sites will be under the direction of CFPEI; CFPEI will identify the amount of money<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>available each year, decide which site or sites to be planted and issue a contract for the trees and the planting</p>
<p>That initial public promotion will focus on undesignated donations, friendship trees, memorial trees, partnerships.</p>
<p>We propose a minimum donation $25.00 in support of planting trees at a site designated by CFPEI. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>A donation of $100 will be added to the endowment with the income used in perpetuity for the planting of trees at sites designated by CFPEI.</p>
<p>For $250, a<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“plaqued’ tree for $250 at<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>site<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>designated by CFPEI.</p>
<p>Customized plantings (large trees, clusters, outside designated areas, non-natiive species may be arranged for an extra charge.</p>
<p>We may have some interest in partnerships (municipalities or community organizations), under which we assist in the planning and make a grant towards the cost.but the organization will manage the planting.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In addition, we would collect and receipt donations.</p>
<p>We plan some publicity about the initiative and seeking donations.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We believe that there is significant potential in trees for special occasions, retirement, recognizing community leaders, graduations, Mothers’ day, birthdays, memorials, etc.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>this year, however, it is likely that most donation will go immediately to the planting of trees in order to jump start the initiative.</p>
<p>Although the Board has not yet made a determination of funds available from the endowment for 2008, our plan is, as a minimum, use those dollars for planting at one site this year.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Ideally, we would like to plant a cluster at an entrance and plant both named and un-named trees on a new site.</p>
<p>We are in the process of identifying sites requiring little or no site preparation.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As soon as that happens, we will:</p>
<p>Negotiate approval to publicize</p>
<p>Set a date for planting/public ceremony</p>
<p>Announce the initiative solicit donations</p>
<p>Make a Island-wide, and perhaps a local, for donations</p>
<p>Because the initiative<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>is fairly labour intensive, we propose a $5.00 charge against each donation for operating purposes, promotion, printing, etc.</p>
<p>to the extent possible, we will encourage contributions through our web site (this reduces our administration)</p>
<p>Each designated site will have coordinates so that donors can locate it via the intenet..</p>
