<p>Dear Dominic:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Again, thanks for your note about your mother’s health and father’s death. Carol and I send our prayers and our sympathy.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It must have been a difficult year for your family; these times are never easy but I am sure that there are many happy memories from earlier times.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The “golden years” are not always golden, and the past year for your family was a roller coaster year indeed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When Christmas passed without the usual note, it raised concern so your note was not a complete surprise. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>In 1955-56, I studied at the Institute of Education, University of London, on a Lord Beaverbrook Scholarship and lived nearby just off Russell Square at, I believe, College Rooms, Woburn Square(?).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was a fairly small residence and housed students from the UK and other Commonwealth countries.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I shared a room on the second floor with Ray Kilfoil, another Canadian, and your father shared an adjacent room with, I believe, Les Ingham from New Zealand (although I am not absolutely sure of the latter). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Although your father and I did not take any classes together, because our rooms were beside each other, we met frequently when entering and leaving our rooms and usually shared a table at breakfast which was provided in a basement kitchen.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I also remember many cups of afternoon or evening tea and conversation.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Your Dad and I seemed to “hit it off” and found ourselves lingering in conversation, exploring the city together, and occasionally going to the theatre and sometimes to church.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That was before Ray and Molly were married and I know that Ray went home some weekends, (Would that be to Watford?).</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>In the spring or early summer of 1956, Ray suggested an outing to Hythe in the Dover area.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We spent a couple of nights and lucked out weatherwise.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The seafront there was beautiful and I remember exploring the area and walking along the bluff overlooking the English Channel.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>While I do not remember your Dad’s exact age, I believe that he was slightly older than I (I will be 80 in September). We talked about wartime Britain and he spoke of conditions on the home front; I remember the vivid picture he painted of the air full of aircraft leaving on air raids to the continent and also the even larger numbers of aircraft leading up to D-Day.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In 1955-56, as you would know, London still bore the marks of all the bombing and I recall, in particular, the acres and acres of bombed out blocks in the Barbican area.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>While I do not believe that he served in the active army, I think that he may have had a stint of service just at the close of the war – but perhaps it was only as a civilian volunteer.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I returned to Canada in August, 1956 and, over the years, we continued to exchange Christmas notes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>On two occasions while visiting England, I visited your Dad and Mum – but I forget the exact years.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Once I visited alone and on another occasion Carol and I traveled together to Norwich, both times by train.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Ray and Molly were thinking of changing houses and they took Carol and I on tour to show a new place they were considering.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I also remember visiting them in their home which had a portion of a wall dating back several hundred years.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I do not recall just how many years but to a Canadian, it seemed very old.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And didn’t they live first after their marriage in the Schoolhouse?</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Obviously he loved his church and spoke often of that connection.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>After finally getting a driving permit, he also spoke about his trips to the seashore and walking the beach.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>For a while both your parents were very active in an initiative to save small schools.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Didn’t your mother edit a newsletter on that subject?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Politics and government were frequent topics of conversation and, if my memory serves me well, your Dad was a firm supporter to the Liberal Party and hoped at one time that they might form a government. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Their letters always included information about the family – what you were doing, where you were living, etc.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Lindsay, as I recall, at one time was thinking of making a visit to Canada.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Did she ever make that trip?</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>We keep well; yes, we have the usual aches and pains, I have angina and a few years ago had an ileostomy but we get about quite well.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We just returned from a motor trip to Florida in the southern US, a distance of 2100 miles each way – so we feel fortunate indeed.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I did not know about the Canada connection; if you could give me some precise information about names, dates and locations, I would be glad to share whatever I can.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The internet makes information gathering so much easier than once as the case.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I find the local genealogical societies a good place to start but also have had responses to letters in the local papers.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Again, thank you for your letter about your Dad and Mum; although not good news, I certainly appreciate your thoughtfulness in writing.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>And please give our warmest regards to Molly.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>To you, Lindsay and Martin, our warmest regards and do keep in touch.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Don and Carol Glendenning</p>
<p><br></p>
