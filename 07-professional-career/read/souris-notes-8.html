  Souris Notes-8
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Project update note from Don reflecting on Souris project progress. Don expresses conviction that Souris is an appropriate, worthwhile project and outlines key activities: ongoing discussions with Richard Gallant about project directorship and SkillsPEI funding arrangements; networking with potential project directors (Alan Campbell connections, Regis Duffy employer contacts); meeting scheduled with Lori Johnston. Don identifies broader strategic questions: organizational readiness for such projects, need for education planning services for other communities, challenges of developing survey methodologies. Demonstrates Don&#x27;s reflective practice, networking capability, and long-term strategic vision.</div>

<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li3">The more I work on this the more I seeSouris as an appropriate project.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Ideally, if we had the money, we could just do it. But I don’t know how much we need</li>
  <li class="li3">Met again with Richard; interested; SkillsPEI interest is in people who qualify under federal program; budget could include Project Director plus person eligible under program but other options; not sure 20/20 has ability to handle payroll; still under discussion; I’m comfortable with SkilsPEI arrangement but would like to broaden it to include a broader sample of education aactivities</li>
  <li class="li3">Tried Pam<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>and Ronnie number of times without success</li>
  <li class="li3">Spoke with Alan Campbell; he gave me names of possible project directors.</li>
  <li class="li3">Regis Duffy provided a couple of names of employers</li>
  <li class="li3">Lori Johnston interested; meeting at 9:30<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>am on Tuesday, October 31; anyone available and interested?</li>
  <li class="li3">Experience with Souris project has made the matter of education services much clearer</li>
</ul>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li3">Is 20/20 ready for such a project?</li>
  <li class="li3">Is there a need/opportunity for a body to perform education planning services for communities or at least to offer advice</li>
  <li class="li3">Can we find a person to direct, for pay, such an “education planning exercise”</li>
  <li class="li3">Could we find a cadre that would be interested in doing such a study as a learning project?</li>
  <li class="li3">We really need a couple of Souris people on our committee</li>
  <li class="li3">A key piece of information for me would be the cost of a survey of, say currnt educational assets or a survey of employer training needs.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If I had this info,I’d look for<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>bit of outside funding</li>
  <li class="li3">Part of the problem is that I do not know enough about surveys to write the specs</li>
</ul>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li3">Next:</li>
</ul>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li3">Will raise with Directors Wednesday</li>
  <li class="li3">Will try harder to reach people whose name I’ve been given</li>
  <li class="li3">Will try to create an initial proposal and get a quote</li>
</ul>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li3">Vacant</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p>Sorry not to have more to report but options are much clearer; will keep you posted</p>
<p>Look forward to your comments</p>
<p>Don</p>
