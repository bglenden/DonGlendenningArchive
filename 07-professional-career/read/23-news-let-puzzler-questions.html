  23 News Let Puzzler-questions
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Don&#x27;s reflective essay framing education practices as &quot;puzzlers&quot;—areas that don&#x27;t make logical sense, such as educators predicting learning timelines before meeting students, time-based rather than competency-based progression, and schools being allowed to set their own standards. He lists eight specific puzzles including the absence of family education advocates, teachers being paid for knowledge rather than results, and formula-driven systems. His tone is critical but constructive, suggesting all issues are explainable and defensible but need addressing.</div>

<div class="reader-content">
<p><b>Puzzler=questions ItEducation: it’s a puzzler</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>I have a friend who often refers to something he cannot understand as being aa puzzler.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>While we’ve not actually had this conversation, I think that he would find the education practices as puzzlers;</p>
<p><br></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li3"><b>The ability of educators to predict how long it will take for a person to learn a given subject – and to do so even before having met the student.</b></li>
  <li class="li3">Why young people are required to attende school for a stated length of time rsther than to reach a stated level of learning,</li>
  <li class="li3"><b>Why a sector is allowed to set and apply its own standards</b></li>
  <li class="li3">Absence of a family advocates: Most families, it seems, have advisors to call on for help, a doctor, lawyer, clergyman, accountant or a banker; we have no equivalent for advice about education.</li>
  <li class="li3"><b>The practice of </b>paid for what they do; teachers, it seems, are paid for what they know.</li>
  <li class="li3"><b>Quality</b>: Time: constant with quality: variable</li>
  <li class="li3"><b>Autonomy:</b> The fact that schools are run directly by a government politicizes most discussion of educational issues</li>
  <li class="li3">Roles and expectations of front line deliverers of educational services are not clear</li>
  <li class="li3"><b>Incentive</b> No recognition for better service or product, or for the same level o seriice or product in a shorter time</li>
  <li class="li3"><b>Formula driven</b></li>
  <li class="li3"><b>Customer service</b></li>
</ul>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>As the saying goes, making this connection may be a long stretch but, collectively, I’ve encountered all of them in conversations, I am sure that all are explainable and; many are defendable may be defendable in the interest of better education, all should be dealt with.</p>
