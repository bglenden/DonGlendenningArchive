	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">While
	there is always room for improvement in any organization, some issue
	are  fundamental, system wide have special significance in that they
	affect the whole organization, influence every student, and permeate
	multiple levels of the organization.  Issues
	are topics, problems or concerns of importance to groups of people;
	they are the big questions.    Issues are not simple problems for
	which definitive answers can easily be found.  On the contrary, they
	are complex and of significance. Once understood, the simpler
	questions can be dealt with and progress resumed.   It’s
	not always easy to describe an issue in precise terms; sometimes we
	confuse issues with symptoms and incidents.  An issue may be
	current, that is a problem of today; emerging and potential issues,
	on the other hand, focus on those threats and opportunities that are
	like to impact on life tomorrow.  But the field is messy.
	 Issues arise in a variety of
	ways but often become of concern when they impact on personal
	interests, activities or events, or are related in some way to
	concerns of friends or family.

	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Simply
	stated, there is a direct relationship between school performance
	and school autonomy. An OECD Report in 2010 reported that “In
	countries where schools have greater autonomy over what is taught
	and how students are assessed, students tend to perform better.”
	Autonomy, include such things as allocation of  resources, hiring
	and dismissing teachers, formulating budgets, decisions about
	curricula and assessment, course offerings and textbooks.  In
	practical terms,  But autonomy and accountability needs to be shared
	with teacher as well.  Teachers should have freedom to:</p>

	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><b>ACCOUNTABILITY</b></p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Martin
	Bedard, Montreal Economic Institute, tells us that when teachers and
	principals have greater autonomy and accountability, students
	generally achieve better grades, even when standards living are
	considered.”  Autonomy, it seems, results in higher levels of
	satisfaction among teachers, better serves students with different
	learning styles, the article also points out that the high level of
	pedagogical autonomy in Quebec increased autonomy and accountability
	is sometimes credited with higher levels of contributes to their
	success in national and international tests.  Currently limited to
