<p><b>DEFINITIONS:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b>Education – any experience that has a formative effect on the way a person thinks, feels or acts</b></p>
<p><b>Mathematics – the study of science of number, quantity, and space.</b></p>
<p><b>Math education – the extent and nature of a person’s attitudes, skills an knowledge in and about the field of math.</b></p>
<p><b>Relevance – quality or state of being closely connected or appropriate</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>EDUCATION</b></p>
<p><b>Our futures and the future of our community will depend in large measure on the nature and level of education gained by our citizens; in addition to serving citizens, governments have a responsibility to ensure that our communities have the skilled people needed to care for the community in which we live. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A 2003 multi-country study by the European Commission found that, if the national average educational attainment level is increased by a single year, aggregate productivity increases by 6.2 per cent right away and by a further 3.1 per cent in the long run.</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Education services are offered through a public-school system devoted to serving the needs of young people, relatively autonomous postsecondary institutions, the private sector and a variety<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>of services operated or administered through provincial ministries of learning, training and workforce development (much of the latter is paid for by federal dollars).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Public and media comment suggest a gap however, between services offered community expectations.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The Council of Ministers of Education Canada (CMEC) highlighted this concern in its statement of July 6. 2016 when it acknowledged that the need to improve transition is shared by many educators, employers, certification agencies and the community at large.</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>MATHEMATICS EDUCATION<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b>Mathematics is considered an essential part of every day life. One of the math issues is that of finding a math curriculum best suits the interests and needs of citizens including people preparing to enter the workforce, <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b>The Public schools deliver math services to school-age youth; follow a curriculum approved by the Department of Education based on a Curriculum Based Outcomes model.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Other providers base math instruction on a variety of sources.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>On the other side of the coin, “receivers” of students have a variety of math interests and needs that may not match those of providers. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>For the most part, math instruction is organized around the conventional structure of mathematics: arithmetic, algebra, geometry, trigonometry, calculus, probability and statistics.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The goal for students of PEI Grade 9 mathematics is to “become mathematically literate adults”.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is an achievable goal, at least for most students but, if math test scores and public comment are used as the measure, the goal remains a challenge rather than an accomplishment. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b>Recent exploration of math has led me to numeracy, which has been described as “having the confidence and skill to use numbers and mathematical approaches in all aspects of life” - at work, in practictal everyday activities at home and beyond, as consumers, in managing our finances, as parents helping our children learn, as patients making sense of health information, as citizens understanding the world about us.”. A report by the PEI Department of Education on </b><span><b>The Early Numeracy Intervention Program (ENIP) which found that numeracy </b><b><i>“gives students the tools and the skills to solve problems logically, and to developmental flexibility, independence of thought, self-efficacy, and the ability to persevere”</i></b></span><b> According to the Conference Board of Canada, “</b><span><b><i>Overall, Canada earns a “C” grade on inadequate numeracy skills."</i></b></span></p>
<p><b><i></i></b><br></p>
<p><b>Whereas, my files include a number of math analyses, there appears o be no standard list of numeracies, competencies, skills or outcomes. or even division or categories of numeracies. Alberta, for example identifies two categories:<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>skills,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b>!} Quantitative information which can be measured and expressed as an amount – numbers, patterns <span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>statistics and probability, and</b></p>
<p><b>(2) Spatial information - physical location of objects or people to the relationships between objects or person<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>plea – measures, location, direction, shape and space</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>However, from my review, the following appear as typical:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b>•	Estimating and calculating with whole numbers<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b>•	Counting and grouping<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b>•	Recognizing and using patterns and relationship <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b>•	Using fractions, decimals, percentages, ratios and rates</b></p>
<p><b>•	Using spatial reasoning</b></p>
<p><b>•	Interpreting statistical information</b></p>
<p><b>•	Using measurement</b></p>
<p><b>•	Managing money</b></p>
<p><b>•	Managing time</b></p>
<p><b>•	Dealing with chance and uncertainty</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>f competencies and /or outcomes used as a basis for curriculum in traditional mathematics, they do not lend themselves as a basis for identifying numeracies. , It appears, that hey result from a further analysis of traditional math whereas numercy skills on the other hand, are identified through a structured survey of typical users.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Given the above, it makes sense to develop a common numeracy map for use in the PEI education system.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As a minimum, it will provide an opportunity to compare the two</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>To develop<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>master list or map of numeracy skills</b></p>
<p><b>Differences between a math analysis and<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>numeracy analysis:</b></p>
<p><b>1.	Described in user language</b></p>
<p><b>2.	Organized around users practices</b></p>
<p><b>3.	Numeracy= survey of applications by users</b></p>
<p><b>4.	Intended<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>for use by learners</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Proposal</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A numeracy map would serve as a common base for users and providers of math services, students, parents, teachers, program planning, student career planning, interagency discussion, performance standards, student tracking, curriculum Development, employment and tutoring, student record keeping, employer hiring, setting entrance requirements. Industry surveys, employer associations, gap analysis, certification, staffing etc.</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>

<p><br></p>
<p>Without doubt, math is important; it should be encouraged for all students and, if schools have required courses, math should be among them. The question, however, is not “Do Islanders need math but rather, “What math skills do Islanders need?”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Since citizenship is a beneficiary of education, I’ll use math for citizenship as the focus of this letter,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I’ve gathered a binder full of math support materials, a number of math analyses, curriculum outlines and even a math text; I also conducted a non-scientific survey among friends.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I found some reports on numeracy by Learning Wales, the Ontario Department of Education and the New Zealand Department of Education to be especially useful.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Based on the above, It appears that:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Citizens apply math to many problems in their everyday lives but great depth in math is not a requirement.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Given that one role of education is to help people practice good citizenship, instruction should focus on applications commonly used rather than an analysis of what’s available.</p>
<p>The literature tells us that, although citizens may not need great depth in math, they need<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>both breadth and fluency.”</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The nature of math required for citizenship has been likened to the knowledge of an automobile needed to drive a car. Success in high school, it appears, would benefit from a significant increase in guided practise.</p>
