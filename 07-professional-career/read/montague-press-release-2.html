  Montague Press Release 2
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Post-workshop press release (February 19, 2014) reporting on Montague&#x27;s February 18 workshop. Key issues identified: lack of basic skills (literacy, numeracy, citizenship) and disconnect between schooling and real life. The release critiques structural issues: government funding creates political short-termism over sound policy. This demonstrates how Don&#x27;s workshops were catalyzing critical community analysis of systemic barriers.</div>

<p>February 19, 2014</p>
<p><b>Preparedness on the hotseat</b></p>
<p>The lack of basic skills, literacy, numeracy and citizenship, were the lead issue raised by participants in a workshop in Montague on Tuesday evening; the relevance of schooling to real life was a second.</p>
<p>The workshop, organized by Education 20/20 first heard a presentation on the findings of a recent survey of over 200 Island youth between the ages of 15 and 25.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The survey, Taking the Pulse of Island Youth, dealt with youth concerns about health, education, employment and social well-being.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The presentation, led by Steve McQuaid, VP of the Community Foundation of Prince Edward Island and Katherine MacDonald, Researcher, provided details about the methodology and findings. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Among the other discussion points was the view that some of the desired changes are structural and not educational, a question as to whether or not it is the role of a school to teach life skills, the declining value of school diplomas, and the difficulty of developing a culture of learning. <span>Since schools are entirely funded and more or less operated by Government, improvement initiatives often reflect short term political considerations over sound principles of public policy”.</span><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Similar workshops are planned for other Island communities in the coming weeks.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>People interested in future activities of Education 20/20, or to be placed on the mailing list for the monthly newsletter, should check the website, www.education2020.ca</p>
