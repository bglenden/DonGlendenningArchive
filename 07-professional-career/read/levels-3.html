  Levels 3
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">This occasional paper addresses educational standards and proficiency measurement. Don reiterates that while many education improvement suggestions focus on early childhood, teacher training, and engagement, standards revision is often overlooked. Key issues include: establishing levels based on subject examination rather than learner age, distinguishing between administrative grade levels and achievement levels, separating teaching from student ranking/sorting, establishing clear benchmarks, and developing published rating scales. He proposes characteristics for assessment: independent from teachers, certifying proficiency, open to all ages/backgrounds, non-competitive, confidential. Concrete examples include Red Seal apprenticeship, Canadian Language Benchmarks, Red Cross Swim Program, and Royal Canadian Conservatory of Music—all models where teaching and certification are separated.</div>

<p>Occasional Paper No. 4		<span class="Apple-converted-space">                        			              </span>July 31, 2015</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Life is a journey with education being what we’ve learned along the way.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>is intended to help us cope with, enjoy and even smooth the way. One source of educational support is our school system<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There are many calls for improvement or change in what, why, when and where we teach sucg S Suggestions for improvement are wide ranging and most focus on early childhood ears, on increasing engagement, better trained teachers; one that is seldom mentioned is that of <span>revamping school standards.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>but one element that seldom gets mentioned is that of standards and, more specifically, what we measure, how we measure and how we report what has been learned. <span>An educational standard is a widely recognized statement that describes what students know or can do<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>at a specific stage of their education. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p>A 2003 multi-country study from the European Commission found that if the national average educational attainment level is increased by a single year, aggregate productivity increases by 6.2 per cent right away and by a further 3.1 per cent in the long run.<span><sup>1</sup><sup></sup></span></p>
<p>Issues</p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li5"><b>Establishing<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>levels of difficulty</b></li>
</ul>
<p>Levels of difficulty or achievement in a subject arises from an examination of the subject.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In fact, one of the reasons Spadey proposed OBE was to make it easier for learners to travel at their own pace. It is a long time since I read xxx by William Spadey but my recollection is that organizing outcomes, ant the curriculum arising therefrom, cannot nor should not, be linked to the age of the learner. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li5"><b>Reporting achievementLinking achievementlevels to ages of learners <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></li>
</ul>
<p>The logic of using the same terminology to label both administrative and grading purposes escapes me; I’m sure that it must puzzle students and parents as well.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The two should be separate.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Have 12 levels of s subject if you must, although that seems excessive, but refer to them as levels not grades; only use Grade for administrative groupings – “My daughter is taking Level 9 Math”.</p>
<p><br></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li5"><b>Combining sorting with teaching</b></li>
</ul>
<p>The role of a teacher is to teach, to help students learn new skills and to increase levels of performance in existing skills.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As part of the instructional process, teachers gather information from all sources and, based on the findings, design new strategies to help learners with their learning.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That is a normal part of the teaching process</p>
<p><br></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li5"><b>Absence of benchmarks</b></li>
</ul>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li5"><b>Lack of published rating scales</b></li>
</ul>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>The above has led the writer to seek an alternative approach to measuring and reporting what students know and are able to do at any stage of their studies.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This paper argues that that assessment function should:</p>
<p>•	Be independent of people who teach</p>
<p>•	Certify individual’s proficiency level</p>
<p>•	Be open to individuals regardless of age or prior formal education</p>
<p>•	Not a competition; establish a person’s level not rank</p>
<p>•	Be confidential</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Proposals:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li5"><b>Standards be set for key citizenship skills – </b>our search for a comprehensive competency or outcome analysis of school subjects drew a blank.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As a result, students are presented with a list of outcomes or competencies that adults think that students can learn.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This, in our view, suggests limits to their learning.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We would prefer an open analysis of a field with levels identified and options put in the hands of the learner rather than proscribed by a teacher.</li>
  <li class="li5"><b>A criterion referenced rating scale – </b>Outcomes based Education requires criterion referenced rating scales.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Some were found but our search did not turn up any in use on any of the provincial public school systems.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is urgent that we modernize the rating scale at the earliest possible date.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li5"><b>Recognizable levels of proficiency – </b>people differ from each other in terms of proficiency based on two measures, the range of competencies and level of achievement on each.</li>
  <li class="li5"><b>Benchmark</b></li>
  <li class="li5"><b></b></li>
  <li class="li5"><b>An independent body to carry out assessments of key skills.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></li>
</ul>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>An independent model described above has a number of benefits including:</p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li5">Let’s students know where they stand</li>
  <li class="li5">Reduces chances of bias</li>
  <li class="li5">Improves consistency</li>
  <li class="li5">Reduces teacher workload</li>
  <li class="li5">Supports independent learning</li>
  <li class="li5">Increases opportunities for innovative learning and teaching</li>
  <li class="li5">Well-described levels of achievement are an aid to learning</li>
  <li class="li5"></li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p>Examples of operating models that include at least some of the proposed features include:</p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li5">The Apprenticeship Red Seal program where apprentices take instruction in institutions, gain experience in real work situations, levels of proficiency are certified by a provincial agency and are free to practice their trade anywhere in Canada.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li5">Canadian Language Benchmarks, which has benchmarked a number of proficiency levels in both official languages and tests and certifies proficiency levels of new Canadians</li>
  <li class="li9"><span>The Canadian Red Cross Swim Program allows </span>swimmers to work or continue training anywhere in Canada.</li>
  <li class="li5">The Royal Canadian Conservatory of Music offers examinations in music that are recognized across the country.</li>
  <li class="li5">Competitive sports separate the function of coaching and referring.</li>
</ul>

<p>School standards are a weak link inEducation, like life, is a journey and like any journey needs recognizable checkpoints that inform us of progress towards our goals; this is currently handled by the education system through some combination of programs, courses, subjects, certificates, credentials, credits, grade levels, years of schooling and test results. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Became obvious during our preparedness workshops Differing understandings and expectation<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li5"><b>Clarity/Measurability/Quality of outcomes</b></li>
</ul>
<p>Outcomes are widely used as a basis for developing curriculum; outcomes apply at many levels including program, course, unit, and lesson level; skills<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>and competencies apply only at the level of the learner. Developing specific learning is a challenge and, unfortunately, there appears to be little in the way of ttrainingfor the task in Canada; neither is there a recognized developer’s guide. Based on the writer’s examination, the development of quality OBE based programming is still a work in progress</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Assessing students for the purpose of assigning levels of proficiency and ranking are not teaching functions, in fact, may not even be an education function, and represent a conflict of interest between teacher and student, thereby interfering with a teacher’s ability to teach.</p>
