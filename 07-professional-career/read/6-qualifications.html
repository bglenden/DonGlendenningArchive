  6 Qualifications
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">One of Don&#x27;s most important conceptual contributions, this document meticulously distinguishes between credentials (diplomas and degrees signifying program completion) and qualifications (actual demonstrated competencies and ability to perform). Don argues that schools have become confused about their role, conflating the awarding of credentials with certifying qualifications. He proposes establishing an independent &quot;Qualification Authority&quot; (AQUA) to assess and certify actual competencies separately from educational institutions. This would reduce bias, enable lifelong learning, and allow educators to focus on teaching rather than sorting. The AQUA would operate on fee-for-service basis with advisory panels and serve all Atlantic Canada, potentially based on PEI. The document includes extensive discussion of how this confusion hampers both education and employment.</div>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Canadians
are great travelers, many have passports.  Passports are issued by
one’s home country, provide basic information about the bearer and,
if examined, provide some insight into the exciting places travelled.
  Many Canadians also hold visas, but they differ from passports. 
Visas, on the other hand, are issued by a receiving country, involve
a more detailed level of scrutiny by the receiving country, specify
the purpose of the visit and provide some detail as to activities to
be carried on; often travelers require both a passport and visa. 
Seems to me that similar statements could be said about credentials
and qualification</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">and
are welcomed  all over the world.

Diploma,
according to Wikipedia, is of Greek origin meaning  &quot;folded
paper&quot;, and is a document issued by an educational institution
indicating that the holder has completed a certain programme of
studies; degrees are also granted by educational institutions on a
similar basis.  Degrees and diplomas are considered credentials in
that they may provide entrance into an arena but are not an indicator
of how well one will perform once there.</p>

A
qualification, on the other hand, speaks to the issue of attitudes,
skills and knowledge required to successfully perform in a role or at
a task.  Employment advertisements often identify both a credential,
such as a high school diploma, and a set of qualifications usually
including training and or experience.  In order to teach, one also
needs a credential, a university degree, and a qualification, a
teaching licence, the latter attesting to one’s ability to teach.</p>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Schools
are teaching institutions; their role is to help learners learn. 
Each learner decides what he or she will learn, although others,
including teachers, influence that decision.  As part of the teaching
process, teachers assess what learners have learned and, depending on
the results, design and implement new teaching strategies. 
Unfortunately and increasingly, the emphasis in school has switched
from helping learners learn to grooming them the education “race”for
a race, and even selecting winners.  The purposes are incompatible
and should be separated.  The answer is to separate the functions of
teaching and sorting.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<h1>An
alternative  Options - Qualification authority</h1>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">In
spite of my earlier comments, I believe that both learners and the
public should have and would benefit from the certification of skills
such as literacy and numeracy.  Perhaps such a service could be
provided through the apprenticeship division or perhaps certification
could be provided through existing  program infrastructure.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: normal">Another
option is to establish a new body, a qualification authority, whose
sole purpose is to evaluate and certify a person’s level of
performance on a task or set of tasks, competencies, outcomes.  Such
an authority should be independent of government and educational
institutions, have its own governing structure, operate on a fee for
service basis, accept clients on direct application or by referral,
issue certificates based on demonstrated performance, and provide
applicants with information on gaps to be filled to meet
certification requirements. </span>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">On
the other hand, perhaps we should consider we could set up a literacy
assessment , perhaps we need  A qualification authority would reduce
if not eliminate the confusion faced by teachers between teaching and
sorting, focus certification more clearly on performance that
matters, support lifelong learning and self-directed study, clearly
focus school evaluation on helping learners learn, and reduce major
for distractions for teachers caused by operating the sorting
process.  It would, in effect, have two clients, the organizations
desiring an assessment service and individuals wanting to aconfirm
their qualifications.  A qualification authority would take its cues
from the destination of the learner, focus on what a client can do
and how well, examine each skills carried and assess their
suitability  also identify gaps for the individual would not simply
administer .  A qualification authority could also play a useful role
in helping people who take on line courses convert them to a
qualification – or even the assessment of foreign credentials.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">If
establishing a qualification authority, it would make sense to
develop a service capable of serving all Atlantic Canada; it would
make an interesting new business venture and could be located on PEI.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">The
acquiring of an education and the certification of qualifications are
two separate functions although the two are closely linked and
frequently one is thought to be the other.  The fact that the
delivery of both functions is, to a large degree, provided or driven
by educational institutions often works to the individual’s
disadvantage in terms of both education and certification.  While
separate certification bodies exist, they appear to place undue
emphasis on results of study and too little emphasis on what has been
learned outside the formal education system.</p>

<h2>Concept</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">The
idea behind this proposal is to establish an independent, private
sector driven body with authority to assess and certify a person’s
level of performance on a task or set of tasks such as found in an
occupation or field.</p>

While
sorting stuff in my basement recently, I came across a number of
diplomas, degrees and certificates.  Although I remember getting
them, I cannot remember ever using even one.  So, one wonders what
