<p><b>DACUM AT FORTY</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p> </p>
<p>As I write this I am reflecting on a recent phone call from a former colleague now retired and living in Alberta by the name of Dave Bell.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is probably 30 years since we last spoke and at that time he worked for CEIC and was most supportive in the early stages of Holland College.  Not surprising he asked about both CVA and DACUM</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The DACUM enquiry got me to thinking so I “googled” the internet to find out what is happening and was truly amazed at the apparent interest and commitment to the DACUM approach. In addition, I examined a few charts, or fragments of charts found on the internet , and was amazed at how closely they followed the original criteria. It was interesting to notice how frequently Canada was mentioned in DACUM entries and I certainly concluded that having been trained or certified by the CVA gave practitioners a leg up on the competition.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The view that DACUM originated in Iowa is widespread, and incorrect. Neither the term DACUM nor the process of identifying competencies has any roots in Iowa.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If Iowa is to be given credit for anything it is for using a single sheet of paper to show modules to be learned.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Here’s what my research turned up:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>In the mid-1960’s Canada decided to establish an experimental project in each province aimed at unemployed youth; each project was given considerable freedom to operate at the local<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>level;<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>probably in late 1967, Robert Adams, an occupational analyst in the Federal Training Branch in Ottawa, was appointed as a member of the Nova Scotia NewStart team</p>
<p>To support the experimental projects initiative, the Federal Government established a project support unit in Ottawa; probably in 1968, Howard Clement, a former Director of the Vocational Curriculum Development Branch in British Columbia became Director</p>
<p>Officials from Ottawa visited a number of training sites in the USA including a Job Corps Program in Clinton, Iowa.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There they saw a one-sheet curriculum, used by both the student and teacher alike, showing the relationship between a number of curriculum modules– but the charts were instructor generated and showed modules not competencies</p>
<p>At Clement’s invitation, on January 22-24, Dr. Oliver Rice of the Clinton project led a group of chef instructors in British Columbia in the preparation of a cooking program <i>a la Clinton</i>.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The result was a single page presentation of modules, not competencies. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Those present discussed the process and, at the end of the day or shortly thereafter, a decision was taken to call the process DACUM – but it was still not competency based;</p>
<p>Officials of the BC Curriculum Unit adopted the model and continued to develop curriculum under the DACUM name.</p>
<p>Adams liked the single sheet presentation and, on his return to Nova Scotia NewStart Corporation, applied his occupational analysis skills resulting in the DACUM model as we know it today.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>For a number of years the two approaches operated under the DACUM umbrella.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>When senior NewStart officials met on July 17-19, 1968, in Montague, Prince Edward Island, Adams provided them with copies of competency based analyses of deckhands, housekeeping/home making and oil burner service.</p>
<p>Don Glendenning, President of the newly established Holland College, met Howard Clement, a former colleague, on PEI to discuss DACUM in late 1969<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Glendenning led a team from Holland College to view the operation of DACUM based programs at the Nova Scotia NewStart Corporation site in Yarmouth in late 1969.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Holland College invited Adams to PEI in March, 1970 to lead a DACUM analyses in electronics. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>In<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>September, 1970, Holland College committed to using DACUM as a basis for all its programs</p>
<p>In May, 1973, Robert Norton and colleagues at the National Centre for Research in Vocational Education (Ohio State) visited Holland College to observe the<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>DACUM model in operstion</p>
