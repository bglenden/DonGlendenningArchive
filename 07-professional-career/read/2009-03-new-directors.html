  2009-03-New Directors
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">A detailed January 23, 2009 analysis for the Nominating Committee on recruitment needs. Don identifies four core foundation roles (endowment building, grant-making, community leadership, small business management) and proposes specific new director qualities addressing identified gaps. He advocates recruiting from private sector, recruiting more women and younger people (40-60), and seeking individuals reflecting emerging PEI demographics (technology, manufacturing, youth, aboriginals, immigrants). His specific assessments of individual candidates reveal both shrewd judgment and knowledge of the PEI professional community. Don emphasizes proper orientation, role clarification, and early assignment of responsibilities to engage new directors meaningfully.</div>

<p><b>COMMUNITY FOUNDATION OF PRINCE EDWARD ISLAND</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>SD-		2009- 03</b></p>
<p><b>Date:		January 23 2009	</b></p>
<p><b>Prepared by:	Don Glendenning</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>To:		Nominating Committee</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Subject:<span class="Apple-converted-space">  	</span>Directors</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>On receiving a copy of John’s note, I went to my trusty flip chart, with scotch in hand I might add, to doodle while thinking about who we are, what we do, our current status, our priorities for the next 3 years and the strengths to be added through new appointees.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>What follows is the result of my analysis.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>A	Community foundations fill three roles:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p>building endowments,</p>
<p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>making grants and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>community leadership (this one will increase in importance as we mature).</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>But we are also running a small but very public business and it should be run efficiently, therefore I would add:</p>
<p>Manage a small business (office operation, IT, records management, contact management, media skills, maintenance program for dono0rs, etc)</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>B	Based on a wide range of discussions about the future of CFPEI, there seems to be considerable agreement that our priorities should be:</b></p>
<p>Endowment development</p>
<p>Marketing/promotion</p>
<p>Efficient administration</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>To that I would add a strength in designing projects and interest funds which would include such strengths as:</p>
<p>Project management (think of IAHSP and literacy initiatives)</p>
<p>Community liaison and leadership</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>C	The Board should be broadly representative of the community;</b> it is not.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We need:</p>
<p>More directors from private sector; most are now from the public sector</p>
<p>More women</p>
<p>More younger people – 40 – 60 years of age</p>
<p>People who reflect the new face of PEI – high tech, manufacturing, youth, aboriginals, immigrants. research</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>D	Some miscellaneous thoughts</b>:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>While optics suggest that we should have a professional accountant on our board, the need is lessened because our Exec Director has such a designation</p>
<p>We have great name recognition</p>
<p>In appointing directors, we need to identify people who are potential Presidents and groom them for the role</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>E	One of the keys to success is having a committed Board.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As part of the selection </b>process, new directors:</p>
<p>Should participate is a lengthy inter/view /discussion about the board, Expectations, expectations, be given the terms of reference of Directors and Committee chairs and have a proper orientation once elected. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>F	It is hard for me to comment on the names since I know so few</b>...<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I also know that there are other considerations than those I identified, however, here is my thinking:</p>
<p>My thinking is coloured, I am sure, by my view that our current staff does not have the skills we need to support our operation, and, while I am not suggesting that new directors perform office functions, we could use people who can direct the improvement of our administration. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>I only know Carol Cabana as a result of the workshop she led.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My understanding, however, is that she did not follow up as she promised.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I think, John, that you asked her to provide some information that she did not deliver.</p>
<p>Don McCormack and Mark Robertson would be great people but we need younger people and, in Don’s case, the public sector is well represented now.</p>
<p>Steve McQuaid and Jeniene Peak have skills we need, have already demonstrated a commitment to CFPEI, are known to us and would take an active role immediately..<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>JoAnn McQuaid is knowledgeable and committed but, I understand, that her job demands keep her close to the office.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>G	I think that we need a more structured appointment/induction process including:</b></p>
<p>An interview with the committee<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Discussion of CFPEI goals, priorities and needs</p>
<p>Review of expectations and<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>of a director (from our policy manual)</p>
<p>Discussion of likely role(s) – which committee, special projects, interests</p>
<p>Formal orientation to support available from office</p>
<p>An early assignment of a task or role.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>(No director should finish year one without being asked to take on a specific role)</p>
<p>Given our focus on Fund development and Marketing, those are the committees that should be staffed first.</p>
