<p>Date:		March 4, 2007</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>To:		Elizabeth Noonan</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>From:		Don Glendenning</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Subject:	Henry Purdy</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Some thoughts on the nomination paper:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Played a leadership role in PEI in the field of Arts and Arts Education for 40 years</p>
<p>Founding member of the Arts Council and supporter of other arts related organizations in PEI</p>
<p>As Director of the School of Visual Arts, led a team of instructors.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Practically all active professional in the arts and crafts were provided instruction under Henry’s leadership.<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Offerings were available in the School of Visual Arts but also through short courses and part time instruction in a variety of centres throughout PEI.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>His visiting artists program and srt exhibitions strengthened the community of artists and art supporters</p>
<p>Was active nationally in the Canadian council of the arts, was awarded the RCA designation 30 years ago and was awarded the Order of Canada for his contribution to the arts.</p>
<p>Since retirement, Henry continues to paint, to teach mature students and teacher classes in Art at UPEI</p>
<p>This is not different from what yo9u already wrote, Elizabeth, but it gives a new set of words to convey the story.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>John Hobday has recently retired for the position of Director, Canadian council for the Arts.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I would replace David Morrison with Wade McLaughlin.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>According to the information in the package, the committee will approach nominees rather than having nominees submit recommendations along with the nomination form.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I’ll leave the envelope at the office for you to pick up when you come to Charlottetown.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Regards</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Don</p>
