<p><b>PERSONAL TALKING POINTS <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>Why I speak out:</p>
<p>Education is most important issue of the day</p>
<p>Cost of speaking out too high for most Islanders</p>
<p>It is my profession</p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>This I believe:</b></p>
<p>Learners centered delivery</p>
<p>Education – intended to help us on the road of life</p>
<p>Role of Department is to ensure quality and fairness of services available; not to actually operate schools<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Grading students is not a school function</p>
<p>Reward people for what they do not for what they know</p>
<p>Role of schools is to help people learn</p>
<p>Current OBE model is not adequate for the task</p>
<p>Standards</p>
<p>Government does not have the capacity or will to change itself</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>General:</p>
<p>Education issues are not unique to PEI</p>
<p>While problems not created by current government, current government has an opportunity and<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>responsibility to improve it</p>
<p>School system needs a self-correcting mechanism<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>System is not capable of changing itself</p>
<p>Because government runs schools, every decision becomes a political one</p>
<p>Only sector where no one benefits from an improvement in productivity</p>
<p>Current focus is in delivery of service and not on development of participants</p>
<p>Significant gap in expectations between what public wants and what system delivers</p>
<p>Lacks accountability for what they do</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Education:</b></p>
<p>We are all on the road of life where most fill roles of individuals, family member, citizen, learner, consumer and producer.</p>
<p>Each person carries his/her own combination of traits based on genetics, culture, health, emotional make-up, previous experiences and imagined future.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Education involves development and change in attitudes, skills and knowledge.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Education and schooling are not the same; we are educated whether or not we go to school</p>
<p>The role of government is to ensure a quality education for every Islander<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Of all sectors, education is the least open to market forces; there are no apparent benefits to those who operate the system for students reaching standards early or reaching higher standards in the available time<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>It takes a community to educate a citizen; while the primary responsibility for education rests with one’s self, the major contributor is the home.</p>
<p><b>Schooling:</b></p>
<p>Parents want their children to be educated not just schooled;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The Importance of institutions (schools, colleges and universities) in acquiring an education is on the decline<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The role of schools and teachers is to help people change;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Credentials and qualifications should neither be determined or awarded by those who teach.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>We have a school system masquerading as an education system;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The education system lacks incentives to respond positively for calls for change</p>
<p>Teaching is a development process with the role of teachers being to help students learn skills required on the road of life.</p>
<p>The ability of schools is limited,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>not only by bureaucracy and inertia, but also by expectations and demands of the community</p>
<p>Improvement in education is directly proportion to their level of autonomy and accountability</p>
<p>Mist students are capabe of graduating but it may take some people longer than others</p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Current organization</b><b></b></p>
<p>Politicized</p>
<p>Focus on schools at the expense of education</p>
<p>Focus on delivery at the expense of quality</p>
<p>Leadership</p>
<p>Responsiveness</p>
<p>Relevance</p>
<p>Lacks capability and will to change</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Priority changes at learner level at little or no cost<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Exemptions/challenge for credit</p>
<p>Basic skills<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Clear mission<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Add public members on curriculum committees</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Changes – long term</p>
<p>External qualification authority</p>
<p>Educational think tank</p>
<p>School autonomy</p>
<p>Engage public in developing a new vision statement</p>
