  System 4 -B
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Refined version synthesizing key factors for education system creation: purpose, clarity, mission/vision, structure, service-based delivery, diagnosis, accountability, and assessment methods. Notably includes discussion of grading as a school function versus an educational function—a conceptual distinction central to Glendenning&#x27;s critique. The document emphasizes the necessity of clear institutional design where organizational form follows functional requirements. Critical observation: despite widespread acknowledgment of delegation benefits, PEI teachers and principals lack meaningful operational freedom.</div>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 108%"><b>Our
future as individuals and as a community will be determined, in large
measure, by the nature and level of education demonstrated by our
citizens. Education is an umbrella concept and includes all
experiences that have had an impact on the way a person thinks, feels
and acts wherever those experiences occur and however they are
triggered. The key to a person’s education, the literature tells
us, are early experiences triggered in and through the home and
family followed by the influence of teachers. A good education is
described as one that prepares a person to handle events occurring in
their daily lives; task of educators is to help make that happen.</b></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 108%"><br />

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 108%"><b>Frick
(Indiana University) tells us that an education system requires (a) a
student (b) a teacher, (c) content, (d) context, and (e) the
community/culture. The writer, on the other hand, considers an
education system to be best described by the services offered; the
Business Roundtable identifies the following education services:
Information, counselling, Instruction, quality assurance. products
and technology, funding and human resources.</b></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 108%"><b>Key
factors in creating an education system include:</b></p>
<ol>
	<li><p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0in"><b>Purpose</b><b>
	-is about direction, what one hopes to achieve. It provides the
	fundamental reason for establishing an organization and is the key
	element from which everything else follows.  PEI literature
	describes our system as one of “developing and delivering”,
	“providing for the development of children” and” helping
	students secure a place.” None are sufficient, I suggest, on which
	to build an education system.</b></p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0in"><b>Clarity
	- </b><b>The
	World Bank, the world’s largest funder of public education, has
	cautioned its members about confusing education with going to
	school; PEI also needs to be careful</b><b>.
	 </b>
	</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0in"><b>Mission/Vision</b></p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0in"><b>Structure</b><b>-Form
	follows function is the standard when structuring any organization;
	PEI structure, it seems, reflects clients rather than functions.</b></p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0in"><b>Education
	is a service to students; a devolved delivery structure is
	recommended. Yet I find that, in spite of all arguments in support
	of delegation, teachers and principals have little freedom to make
	adjustments to better serve student needs.</b></p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0in"><b>Diagnosis</b></p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0in"><b>Accountabilitie</b><b>s
	are not clearly articulated; Mathieu Bedard of the Montreal Economic
	Intitute tells us that “autnomy and accountability jointly applied
	“would cost practically nothing and allow education to better
	adapt to the diversity of student needs and aptitudes”.   The OECD
	also tells us that student results on PISA tests ae better in
	schools that have  autonomy for their day to day operation. </b>
	</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0in"><b>Grades
	</b><b>are
	an attempt to quantify the amount or level of learning. Testing
	typically iocuses on the acquisition of knowledge. Self assessment
	first is receiving growing support and is thought to help bidge the
	gap beweem schooling and education</b><b>.</b></p></li>
