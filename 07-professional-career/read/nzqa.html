</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Don&#x27;s notes on New Zealand&#x27;s National Qualifications Framework development, examining why NZQA emerged: gaps in recognized qualifications, unclear linkages between qualifications, unclear training access, non-recognition of prior learning, inconsistent terminology, and international mobility needs. Key principles include simplification, open learning pathways, lifelong learning emphasis, and performance-based assessment. The framework contains eight levels covering age six upward, using Units of Learning that may count toward multiple qualifications. Units include title, credit rating, performance criteria, and accreditation processes. Schools are accredited emphasizing teaching quality management, monitored by national staff. Learners receive records showing achieved units and earned certificates/diplomas.</div>

<p><b>86-NZQA</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>The development of a national qualifications framework in New Zealand arose from the fact that:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>· Some areas of learning had no nationally recognized qualifications;</p>
<p>· There was no obvious linkage between many of the qualifications and others · People were unclear where to find training to meet desired qualifications;</p>
<p>· Existing qualifications frequently did not recognize knowledge and skills already gained;</p>
<p>· Titles anctJDi1innology of certificates and diplomas have not been used consistently; and · Natinally rciognized certificates should help New Zealanders if they wish to work overseas.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The key principles of the National Qualifications Framework are:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>· It is desigsned to be easily understood and greatly simplifiesssssssssssssssssssssssss the range of career-related and academic qualifications that existed previously;</p>
<p>· It is designed to open pathways to earning. As learners progress they carry with them their previous learning which may be credited to a range of qualifications.</p>
<p>· It promotes lifelong learning. The primary focus is to meet the requirements of the learner. In doing so, no disticnction is drawn between general education and career-srelated learning.</p>
<p>· Assessment focuses on learner performance which is judged against published national standards. The use of clear standards in assessment allows flexibility in learning. As well as gaining recognition for formal learning, learners can be assessed on the job or through the recognition of pprior learning,;proces~</p>

<p>The Framework t&amp;Cks~er Mrm J; the first six years of education, although it i;</p>
<p>possible for children to earn credits at a younger age.~the Ilrameworl&lt;: has eight levels.</p>
<p>A National Certificate will be used to recognize achievement at the first four levels. A nNational Diploma will recognize levels 5 to 7. Initial degrees will be placed at Level 7.</p>
<p>Level 8 is reserved for advanced degrees, diplomas and certificates.</p>

<p>The building blocks of the framework are Units of Learning. A Unit of Learning isw a set oflearning outcomes which a learner must master. A number of units may lead to a nationally recognized qualification. The same unit may apply to more than one q ualification. All units are not of the same length; some may be completed in a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
