<div class="reader-summary">Don examines the credentialing system in Canada and who should award credentials. He questions whether displayed diplomas and degrees actually indicate competence to serve, noting his experience as an employer revealed transcripts more useful than degrees. Don critiques how institutions award credentials after completing pre-set programs based on criteria that may not reflect occupational standards, limiting student choice and resulting in graduates following similar instruction regardless of individual interests. He contrasts academic credentials with more specific certificates and calls for reconsidering what credentials are needed, who should award them, and on what basis. Don emphasizes that teachers teach while schools sort learners, and this sorting function profoundly impacts future life choices. He questions current approaches to credentialing in addressing employer-valued competencies like communication, mathematics, history/geography knowledge, and work habits.</div>

<p><b>13 Who should sort?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>

<p><br></p>
<p>Canadians like credentials. Places of work, whether they be trade, technical or professional, often display credentials of people who work there. I am not sure if such displays are intended to impress or intimidate. Most credetiaals I enclounter are issued by universities although a few are issued by professional and technical associations.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Such displays tell about some life choices of the bearers have made such as where they went to school, the level of schooling they attained, and maybe some specialized courses they have taken.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>. Presumably they are placed in a conspicuous location to support the notion that the bearer, and the person providing yhou service, is competent to provide the service you are waiting for.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>As the user of services provided by an establishment, I put this information in the category of interesting but not very useful. That is not to downplay the sweat equity students put into the<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>acquisition of diplomas and degrees but seldom do the items on display tell me about the competence of the person about to serve me.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>To qualify for a degree, diploma or certificate, from an educational institution, a person follows a pre-set program of studies<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>determined by the institution, or an instructor in the institution who may, or may not, have worked outside the institution, or of if he has, he did so many years earlier.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In addition, the criteria may or may not reflect the criteria in the field or occupation in which the learner is preparing.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>orassessment is conducted by the institution, students are sorted by the institution, credentials are awarded based on which has a very limited opportunity for individual choice with the result that most students aiming for a diploma or degree having little opportunity to explore ideas of particular interest. Whild these credentials do not guiarantee anything, they do indicate that the holder followed a course of instruction much like that followed by a similar holder from a similar institution anwhere in Canada.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>They are awarded based on study of selected components of a variety of disciplines.</p>

<p>Certificate are usually more specific. Some only certify that the holder has taken a course of a set duration, others may inform the reader that the person has successfully completed a course, while still others may provide some information about the level of achievement.</p>
<p>Transcripts, which are a form of certificate, provide a "mark" for each subject studied each year.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>/</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>In my role as an employer, I cannot ever remember asking for or receiving a copy of a degree or diploma as part of the assessment process; I did, however, find transcripts quite useful.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>While everybody has their pet peeves about the education system, the complaints I hear usually are about:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>· Communication skills · Math/science skills · Canadian history or geography · Work habits and attitudes</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Our current approach to credentialing seems not to address these concerns.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>It is unlikely that we can or should prevent educational institutions from awarding credentials. Based on my own experience and in talking with employers, I question if credentials now offered really serve the public and student needs.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>On reflection, one is left with three questions. What credentials do we need and why?</p>
<p>Who should award the credentials we need? On what basis should they be awarded?</p>
<p><br></p>

<p><br></p>
<p>, also, the holders in their graduation exuberance had had the certificates framed and needed a place to hang them.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Teachers teach and schools, where most teaching occurs, sort those who are taught.</p>
<p>Given the apparent confusion between schooling and teaching, this gives schools a key role in determining what will be taught, to whom and when. Most of this occurs while we are young, The sorting function in particular, I believe, has a major impact, much of ",'" /, it negative, on life later choices available to our youth</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Good's Dictionary of Education defines a credential as "a certificate stating that a student has graduated from a certain curriculum or has passed certain subjects with indicated marks". Credentials come with a variety of labels. Most sought after and recognized, I believe would be a university degree, which until recently could only be awarded by a university but now are awarded by some community colleges. The awarding of diplomas follows the same lines but are not as highly regulated and usually involve 2-3 years of study.</p>
