  Life Roles
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Don presents his framework of six life roles (individual, learner, producer, consumer, family member, citizen) as the foundation for school outcomes. He argues schools should be &quot;incubators&quot; providing safe environments to experiment and fail. However, education lacks clear stakeholder alignment—student, provider, and investor interests don&#x27;t clearly identify who the &quot;customer&quot; is. Don contrasts educator input measures (subjects taught, credentials, facilities) with community output measures (what graduates can actually do). He concludes that reconciling these views—aligning education content and measurement with community-based standards—is essential for raising educational quality.</div>

<p><b>BETTER EDUCATION FUND<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b><b></b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>We fill many life roles in the course of a life time.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The Oregon Education Act of 1991 identified the following six: individual, learner, producer, consumer, family member and citizen.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The relative importance of each role varies from individual to individual and will change over time.<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>People<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>move into some roles without formal schooling but it is generally recognized that, at some point in our lives and for a varying length of time, all can benefit from help in the form of instruction, advice, coaching, information, counseling and practice.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The amount of help needed varies from individual to individual; that is one of the complications of teaching.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But the ability of each learner to function in society is the final test of the school system</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Schools are incubators in that they prepare young people for life in the adult world; they help people in their most formative years to develop skills needed in their adult lives.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Schools offer a safe and controlled environment to experiment, to try new things, even to fail.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Society has placed few restrictions on what schools can or should do but neither has it described well its expectations.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Schools do not operate on the normal business model in which a person or a company invests in a product or service and a consumer or client purchases the product or service.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In the case of education, there are at least three sets of stakeholders and their interests overlap.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is not always clear just who is the customer?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>the learner?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>the service provider? the investor?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Where does a prospective employer fit in?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Who is accountable to whom and for what?</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The output of schools for each learner is the growth that occurs between entering and leaving the school system – that is, growth attributable to the efforts of teachers.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The clearer we specify the desired exit performance, the more likely learners are to achieve it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The better we describe the difference schools make, the more likely we are to meet our community’s expectation and of the return on their investment.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The ultimate objective is to prepare young people to function in adult roles.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>For some learners, the transition from schools occurs without completion of high school, for others the transition takes after Grade 12, for the remainder the transition occurs after a stint of postsecondary study.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Educators measure quality by input criteria, subjects taught, years of schooling, institutions attended, entrance requirements, qualification of instructors/teachers, facilities, access to new technology and level of performance on tests and exams.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>What the learner can do with what he knows, performance, is not measured but must be inferred. <span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Taxpayers, consumers, potential employers, on the other hand, judge graduates on what they can do – on the nature and level of service provided or the product displayed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A consumer of goods and services judges on the basis of quality of work or service, time required to complete the task, communication skills related to the task, good work habits, product knowledge, work habits, abilities to do the assigned tasks.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The public bases its judgment on performance, that is, how<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>the person functions generally in the role tha intersect with them.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>These are output measures. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Little progress in raising standards is likely until these conflicting views are reconciled; it is time to align the content and measurement of education with community based standards.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Dialogue needs to begin soon; external interventions may help to launch the dialogue.</p>
