<p><b>Meals</b><b></b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Although I often worked at the “thrasher’ at<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>home, I never worked a “thrasher” elsewhere.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I spoke, therefore, with brothers, Norman and Kenneth about their recollections.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A Threshing crew consisted of 8 or more men.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>At least one meal was provided and sometimes two meals if the crew worked late to finish up.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The crew started at 8:00 am. Dinner was about 11:30.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Meals might vary but usually included meat (roast beef or maybe pork), potatoes, carrots maybe turnip, bread, with tea (cannot remember ever having coffee) and dessert.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Jean says that apple pie was a favourite.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>One of Mum’s regular desserts when there was a crowd at the house was gingerbread with whipped cream.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The second meal, if there were one, would be about 4:00 pm.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Many times the work was done by 4:00 pm or so and a second meal was not necessary.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Washboard Pie</p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>Washington pie was a regular dessert at home especially when entertaining.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It consisted of two layers of white cake with a filling between.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Seems to me that the filling was either raspberry or strawberry preserves but could have been a lemon filling as well.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Earl Taylor used tease Mum by calling it “washboard pie”</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Mushrooms</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>While at the cottage earlier today, I picked a beautiful large mushroom.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Since then I’ve peeled it and fried it in lots of butter.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Was it ever delicious? <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I am reminded of picking mushrooms when I was a youngster.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>For some reason, I recall picking them on the way home from taking the cows to the Finno” field – the one at Finno’s turn.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>At that time the land on the back side of the road was an open, un-cultivated field.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was a good place to find mushrooms.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Seems to me that Dad always checked to see that we had not brought toadstools – then Mum fried them.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I think that the one I just ate was a<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>mushroom. However, if you do not receive this letter, you will know otherwise.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Canning</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>As I was picking beans today, I thought about all the preserving of fruits and vegetables at home.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Cucumber pickles, chow and peaches went into bottles.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Apple and crab apple jelly was also preserved in bottles.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I really do not know the recipes or the process but I recall the pulp from the apples and crabs being placed in a cotton cloth, (the corner of a flour bag perhaps?) and the juice dripping into the bottles.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>On a few occasions I recall apples being dried in the big bedroom next to the driveway.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The apples were peeled and cored then cut into one-quarter inches thick (like a flat donut.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The “donuts” were strung on string, which was hung across the room to dry.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Later, during the war, I think, we got a canning machine, which allowed vegetables, peas beans, blueberries, mostly at our place, to be canned in a safe way.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Peas were taken from the pods, beans were “snapped” ends removed and broken into pieces about an inch long, the washed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Beans were blanched but I do not think that peas had to be blanched.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Blanching was accomplished by cooking them for a couple of minutes in boiling water; then they were rinsed in cold water. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Cans were bought by the box and could be lined (a gold colour inside) or unlined.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I think that we always used lined cans; they were supposed to be safer. Some food items could not be preserved in unlined cans.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Covers were purchased separately.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The canner rotated the can and put increasing pressure on the lid so that the can and the lid were sealed together.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>In preparation for cooking, a large pot, perhaps the bottom half of a barrel, was filled with water and a fire was build under it in the yard.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When the water was boiling, the cans were placed gently into the boiling water and boiled for an hour or two.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>After cooking, the cans were lifted out and cooled quickly in cold water in another tub a wash tub as I recall..<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When they were cooking, both ends bulged; after cooking and cooling, the ends snapped back.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When cooled, cans were inspected.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If any still bulged, they were opened and eaten for supper.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Cans were stored on a shelf in the basement and used throughout the winter.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If a can was found to have bulging ends, it was thrown away because of likely spoilage.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Strawberry Season</b><b></b></p>
<p> </p>
<p>I write this having just picked and eaten the first 8 strawberries from my garden.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I recall the truck coming to our door loaded with strawberries.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Mum usually bought a pail – a dollar a pail, as I recall but I know, also, that she always bargained.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The strawberries would be hulled, put in the large, round, enameled pan for mixing bread and placed in the basement on the cold floor. (We did not have a refrigerator at the time.)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Our dessert that evening was strawberries and cream, usually with a little sugar.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Mmmm good.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Because we were a large family, a pail of strawberries could be gone the first evening – sometimes there were a few left for the next day.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Yankee Toast</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>My sister, Lillian, recalled how much she enjoyed Mum’s Yankee Toast.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I vaguely recall it and others in the family recalled it but not how it was made. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>A search of the internet reveals a number of recipes but they were a version of French Toast – usually with cinnamon.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>An enquiry to Margaret Prouse, a regular contributor on food to the Charlottetown Guardian, brought the following information.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><i>“Yankee toast was served as a treat at either breakfast or supper.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was prepared by combining a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></i></p>
<p><i></i><br></p>
<p><i></i><br></p>
<p><i>bit of pork fat, a good tablespoon of molasses, and about the same amount of water in a cast iron frying pan.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A slice of bread was dipped in the mixture in the frying pan, and then quickly turned over so that both sides were coated.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>One side was fried until the molasses caramelized and then the process was repeated to the other side.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Butter could be used instead of pork fat. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></i></p>
<p><i></i><br></p>
<p><i>Another approach is to take a thick slice of bread and butter both sides.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Heat molasses until it bubbles.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Allow bread to cook briefly than turn over and repeat.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Home made bread is best and preferably a day or two old;<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“store bought” bread tends to get soggy.”</i></p>
