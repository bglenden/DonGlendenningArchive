<p><b>LAUBACH LITERACY COUNCIL</b></p>
<p><b>CHARLOTTETOWN, PEI- JUNE 3, 2006?</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Speaking Notes</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Thanks for invitation<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>and for the kind words of welcome</p>
<p>I am delighted to be here; miss contact with educators</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Welcome delegates from across Canada</p>
<p>	Fortunate to travel to all Provinces</p>
<p>Each part this country is unique</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Great country</p>
<p>Much to be thankful for</p>
<p>I am proud to be Canadian</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>After Carol invited me to be here this evening, I looked at the web page.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And browsed a number of articles.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Liked what I saw – not too much academic jargon</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Commend you and the many volunteers for your efforts</p>
<p>Teachers in universities, colleges and schools system get considerable attention.</p>
<p>You are unsung heroes of education</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Recognize some of the PEI names<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Graduated from Miramichi Rural High in 1946</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Started teaching in a one room school in NB in 1947 at the age of 17</p>
<p>	Consider myself to have been in education ever since.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I enjoy the informality of this sized group</p>
<p>First time I spoke to a group in the west</p>
<p>Honour of your visit – holding gathering in the auditorium</p>
<p>Obviously delighted</p>
<p>Mentioned it to my boss when I returned</p>
<p>Boss pointed out the origin of auditorium</p>
<p>Audio-to hear; Taurus – the bull</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>My mother although with limited schooling enjoyed reading<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>In the country</p>
<p>No library</p>
<p>Take book she finished to church meeting and return with another.</p>
<p>All were well worn and cannot remember my mother having a new book</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>One Christmas, I believe it was in 1938, I received several books as gifts</p>
<p>Hard to get me out to do the chores; had my head in a book until they were all read</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Importance of literacy</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Those of us who read, take literacy for granted; you know the facts better than I</p>
<p>So I will not repeat them</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Literacy is a crucial<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Key to coping and to a productive and satisfying life</p>
<p>Importance is far beyond the economic impact on our communities</p>
<p>	The key to success in school and to a good education is literacy<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>We confuse -<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>education and schooling</p>
<p>		They are not the same</p>
<p>		educators perpetuate a myth</p>
<p>		</p>
<p>Schooling is what you learn in school – the acquisition of knowledge</p>
<p>		</p>
<p>Education is the application of knowledge<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>what you do with what you know</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Some of the best educated people I know have limited formal schooling</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>My wife commented recently about the daughter of a friend who was having difficulty finding permanent employment.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>“She has a good education”</p>
<p>How do you know</p>
<p>Graduate of UPEI and a masters Degree from …</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I understand, but how do you know that she has a good education?</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>We speak of our education system but I’m not sure we have one</p>
<p>We do, however, have a school system</p>
<p>I often think that Departments of Schooling’ is a more appropriate term than Department of Education</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>In health – 	Family doctors</p>
<p>Specialists</p>
<p>		Pharmacies</p>
<p>		Special clinics – screening</p>
<p>		Blood pressure stations in drug stores</p>
<p>		Home remedies</p>
<p>		Walk-in clinics</p>
<p>		Visiting nurses</p>
<p>		Associations and interest groups</p>
<p>		Newspaper columns</p>
<p>Health education campaigns</p>
<p>		And of course we have hospitals</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>In education – But in education, everything is school based</p>
<p>		Instruction</p>
<p>Parent interviews</p>
<p>		Libraries<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>		Guidance counselors</p>
<p>		Education specialists</p>
<p>		Coaching</p>
<p>		</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>What do we have outside our schools</p>
<p>Book stores</p>
<p>No regular newspaper columns</p>
<p>Local libraries</p>
<p>Science fairs</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Why not 	vocabulary clinics</p>
<p>		Writing workshops</p>
<p>		Test your listening skills</p>
<p>		</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>		</p>
<p>There is an incentive to staying well without going to the hospital</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Not so in education</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>In fact there is a disincentive to learning outside the school<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>certification</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Certification has become a barrier to a more open education system <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>	Even if you learn outside the school you are required to go to school to have it validated</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Schools are intended as places to help people learn</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Schools also sort	pass and fail</p>
<p>			Grade and don’t grade</p>
<p>			Get a certificate or not</p>
<p>			Get an A, or a B or a C</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Sorting interferes with the learning process.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>And it is a conflict of interest.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>If ill and you get better that’s great</p>
<p>Hospitals do not issue certificates to say you are healthy</p>
<p>Your doctor doesn’t certify that you to be healthy</p>
<p>If you need a health certificate, you go to<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>a doctor other than your family doctor</p>
<p>And your doctor does not publicly rank you in terms of your health</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>You can add significantly to your education outside the school – and you may even perform better</p>
<p>But it doesn’t count</p>
<p>You need to have a certificate</p>
<p>Only schools issue education certificates.</p>
<p>So you are stymied</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>There is a conflict of interest when the institution that teaches<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>also sorts or certifies.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I think that sorting decisions actually<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>interfere with learning<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>If schools must sort, and I don’t think they should,</p>
<p>At least remove the teacher from the process</p>
<p>Make sorting a separate function.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Sure, Schools need to measure in order to provide better instruction</p>
<p>But Schools should not be in the sorting business.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>If sorting is necessary, set up an agency to do it</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Again, thank you for the invitation</p>
<p>And keep up the good work</p>
<p><br></p>
