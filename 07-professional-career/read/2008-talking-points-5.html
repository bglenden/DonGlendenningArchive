<div class="reader-summary">Don&#x27;s position paper on property access dispute at Glenway cottage community. Argues that Glenway is private property owned since 1971, emphasizes cottage owners&#x27; rights against encroachment, and questions the McInnis family&#x27;s access request as a potential opening for further demands.</div>

<p>Meeting about McInnis Requests</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Glenway is not a charity. It’s a property holding owned by its cottage lot owners</p>
<p>And should be regarded and treated like private property, just as your house and driveway in town are.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>We have owned the glenway property since 1971 and legal access for the McInnis’s</p>
<p>to use our road had never come up until the winter of 2005, 34 years!</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Giving someone who is not a property owner access to our road compromises our rights</p>
<p>as property owners. It increases our liability, road erosion, etc and<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>loss of control without any apparent compensation.</p>
<p>This was certainly not part of our plan when glenway was purchased. The full plan of glenway was apparent from the beginning to everyone who wished to purchase a lot;</p>
<p>Roadways, accesses .covenants, middle lots , common grounds.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Last year glenway roads, accesses, common ground was turned over to the association of lot owners in good faith that care would be taken for the benefit of the owners.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>My take on Linda having access on our road<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>is this.</p>
<p>By now Linda would already have the 14 foot<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>road access on the McInnis’s own property</p>
<p>And her property lot if it were important<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>to any of them. They would not wait for</p>
<p>For us to change our mind. Therefore I think this request is a red herring and an opening for the McInnis’s to make further requests.</p>
