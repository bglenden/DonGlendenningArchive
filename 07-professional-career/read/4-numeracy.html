  4 Numeracy
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Letter from Don distinguishing between mathematics (theoretical study of number, quantity, and space) and numeracy (applied confidence in using numbers for practical life purposes). He argues that citizenship education would benefit from emphasis on numeracy rather than pure mathematics, drawing on definitions and frameworks from Learning Wales, Ontario, and New Zealand education ministries. He suggests a curriculum shift from math to numeracy could significantly improve mathematical literacy levels in PEI.</div>

<p><b>Background</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>All schools, it seems, teach math, the study of the science of number, quantity and space. it is considered a key skill in all life roles, doing so is designed to “prepare students to solve problems, communicate and reason mathematically, appreciate the value of mathematics, make connections between mathematics and its applications, commit themselves to lifelong learning and become mathematically literate adults using mathematics to contribute to society.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Numeracy, on the other hand, has been described as “having the confidence and skill to use numbers and mathematical approaches in all aspects of life - at work, in practical everyday activities at home and beyond, as consumers, in managing our finances, as parents helping our children learn, as patients making sense of health information, as citizens understanding the world about us.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>While I’ve not found a standard list of components, the following seems typical:</p>
<p>“Interpret data, charts and diagrams</p>
<p>Process information</p>
<p>Solve problems</p>
<p>Check answers</p>
<p>Understand and explain solutions</p>
<p>Make decisions based on logical thinking and reasoning.”</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Math skills and numeracy skills come from different places. the skills needed for citizenship; should come from a survey of citizens and not from mathematicians, math teachers and others who work in the math<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>field<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>- but one hires math teachers to teach them.</p>
<p>On the face of it, it seems <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>that our needs as<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>citizens is for numeracy rather than math, Perhaps this would be a better field of study for Islanders that the study of math. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>A switch from math to numeracy would go a long way towards improving math literacy levels in PEI</p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
<p><br></p>
