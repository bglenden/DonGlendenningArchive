</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Meeting notes from October 17, 2012, at an Education First Canada Inc. consultation in Stratford, PEI, where Dr. Glendenning participated with Alice Taylor, Wayne MacMillan, and others. The discussion focused on critical educational issues: teacher training for social/emotional development, the role of schools in changing student environments (bullying, drugs, police presence), inflexible systems lacking accountability, and the need to balance schooling versus education. Notes suggest consultation with external stakeholders and establishing baseline assessments before implementing organizational changes.</div>

<p>Education First Canada Inc.</p>
<p>October 17, 2012 meeting</p>
<p>Stratford, PEI</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Present: Dr. Don Glendenning, Alice Taylor, Wayne MacMillan, Garth Staples, Donald Arsenault</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>It was suggested that teacher training should include an orientation related to how to change attitudes particularly in relation to students’ social/emotional development.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The importance of defining the role of schools in society was noted.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The environment that students experience today is changing: police officers stationed in schools, texting, code of silence, drugs, bullying, ...</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Teachers are expected to take on a variety of roles and responsibilities and some teachers are reluctant to engage as they don’t see some of these as being their role.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>With bullying, there is a reluctance to respond, to confront. Both sides need help and to learn skills. However, we tend to want to rescue the child who is being bullied and they can become a victim which perpetuates the situation.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Students and teachers are operating in a stressful environment. With diminishing resources, people are over-worked and they are trying to do the best they can in the context of increased funding pressures and increased expectations (with declining enrolments and program pressures, teachers are handling more programs).</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Discipline has become an issue as the school environment can contribute to “acting out” and some teachers may be threatened by students and parents.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>There is a need to get back to teaching and to training that reflects the public’s philosophy and values (need more experiential learning until Grade 3 – approach to teacher training should be reviewed: university vs teachers’ college). Mentoring new teachers is perceived as being critically important.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>It was suggested that a group of people who are making educational decisions need to have a discussion regarding these issues that also engages people from outside the system (what are the alternatives? Are there success stories that should be considered, such as the cadet program at Colonel Grey?; Pathways to Learning?).<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>It is important to find ways and means of monitoring students who are at risk.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Concern was expressed regarding the interchangeable use of “schooling” and “education” and its impact on the system. It was suggested that, collectively, as a community, we have a responsibility to get the right mix of “schooling” and “education”.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>It was noted that the system is not sufficiently flexible and that there are varying levels of accountability (compared to other systems, the “consumer” has less choice in the school system).</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>There appears to be an important tool related to managing under the umbrella of the collective agreement that is missing in the principal’s tool kit.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>A baseline of the current situation should be established along with a vision for the future that includes accountability tools that will facilitate measurement of results.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>It will be important to define our focus, our priorities and our boundaries (we can’t be all things to all people: we need to identify the initiative that this organization is going to take on – teacher training?, bullying?, sharing best practices?, social relationships? attitudinal issues?, literacy?, …)</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>There seems to be a perception that the educational system is not meeting the needs of parents, students and teachers and that the system is failing our children.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>It was agreed that the organization needs to obtain consensus on its focus (have a discussion regarding the best place to put our effort as an organization). Next meeting should bring together the original group of participants in this discussion to seek their advice and guidance regarding organizational mandate, structure, strategy to move forward and resourcing.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Next steps could include consulting with a broader audience as well as identifying areas where the organization can achieve some early successes in order to gain legitimacy, credibility, visibility and profile.</p>
