  Issues-2 Education
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">(160 words):**
Don Glendenning defines systemic education issues and proposes functional solutions. He reiterates that education—preparation for life roles—differs fundamentally from schooling and requires comprehensive service delivery (policy, governance, instruction, resources, information, counseling, quality assurance). Key issues include: inadequate public statements of educational purpose and principles; limited Department mandate focused narrowly on curriculum delivery rather than broad educational leadership; absence of comprehensive vision statements; underserved information functions; conflicting quality assurance approaches; and disconnection from communities served. Don advocates for independent certification bodies (as in apprenticeships) to separate teaching from grading, allowing teachers to focus on learning without compromising their role. He emphasizes that community engagement and clear functional organization are essential for system improvement. The document calls for collaborative conversations between educators and communities to develop shared understanding.</div>

<p><b>About 4-11</b></p>
<p><b>What is a systemic issue?</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>It is widely recognized that education is a key factor in determining each citizen’s quality of life; in the same way, the collective education of our citizens will determine to a significant degree the quality of the communities in which we live.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In recognition of its importance, governments provide massive support for public education. The investment is justified for two reasons, one to ensure a high level of personal growth and development for every citizen; the other is to ensure the common good</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>An education system is a set of services put in place by a community to encourage and support the education of its citizens. Given the numbers served and the wide range of prior experience, capabilities and interests of learners, designing and operating an education system is no easy task.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>While gaps in understanding are to be expected, it seems to the writer that the gap between the providers and users of educational services continues to widen.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Preparation for life’s roles is called education and the better prepared we are the better we are able to cope with all that we encounter, or create.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Educating is a complex matter made so by the fact that each person is unique in many ways, unique in basic physical, mental, emotional make-up; unique in the range and nature of previous experience, unique in perceived futures, but also unique in terms of learning pace, style and needs.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>One’s education is often described as any experience that has a formative effect on the way we think, feel or act; the nature and level of one’s education is demonstrated of as what we can do with what we have learned.</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>A person’s education may be defined as any experience that has a formative effect on the way we think, feel and act; our education emerges each day, by accident or deign, through a normal life span.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Typical education functions include policy and governance, Instruction, human resources, learning products and technology, Information and counselling, funding and quality assurance. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Although there are significant differences, for the most part services are delivered through schools and school boards.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>What will be taught, when, how, by whom and how measured is a direct responsibility by Provincial Departments of Education, - and its elements of this framework that appear out of sync.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Functions</b></p>
<p><b>gag</b></p>
<p><b>Overarching principles - Province needs public statement of over-arching beliefs and guidelines that set a framework for planning, developing and implementing educational services. Given the number of Government Departments, institutions and agencies delivering educational services including private schools, such a document would inform the public, set the tone, increase consistency and reduce red tape throughout the system.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>learn mandate - Limited mandate given to or assumed by the Department of Education.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Government Departments generally describe their role as one of “encouraging and supporting their sectors”. The Department of Agriculture and Fisheries, for example, describes its role as that of “advancing Prince Edward Island primary industries and its approach to food development, production and sales”. The Department of Education, on the other hand, “develops and delivers high quality programs and curriculum in English and French to Island children from birth to Grade 12” – a narrow mandate for such a major field of service.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b>a “clear and compelling” vision of education for all Islanders.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Although much has been written about education, a comprehensive vision statement does not currently exist for PEI. We believe that having such a statement is required, especially for a service as large and complex as education, however, we are not suggesting another study but rather a document prepared by a small working with opportunity for citizen-<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></b></p>
<p><b>Engagement with community served - Availability of information.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Souri’s residents pointed out the need for more and better information about education offerings.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I find information to be an underserved education function; the provision of education needs to be cut loose from instruction and made available to any and all who could benefit from it.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Standards - 	Establish a qualification body for the purpose certifying individual levels of 	achievement to persons wanting or needing such documentation.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The role of 	teachers is to help others learn; when teachers rank their students, they are 	putting their ability to teach at risk. Assigning student grades, selecting 	students for prizes and awards and awarding diplomas and degrees is a sorting 	process and should not be part of a teacher’s role.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Apprenticeship with 	certification through a Provincial Department of Labor and music through the 	Royal Canadian Music Conservatory are examples of the recommended 	arrangement.</b></p>
