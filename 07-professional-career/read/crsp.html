  CRSP
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Glendenning&#x27;s retrospective on designing CRSP, a competency-based secondary school model combining personalized, competency-based, and computer-based components with flexible structures and site-based management. Developed in his post-retirement consulting work (after 1987), the model was designed to be an alternative to &quot;lock-step, teacher-centered, classroom-based delivery.&quot; The document describes major shifts embodied in CRSP: from fixed admission schedules to flexible entry/exit; from time-bound to competency-based curriculum; from graded to non-graded continuous progress; from teacher-centered to learner-centered; and from percentage-based to competency-based reporting. Glendenning claims it&#x27;s &quot;the only model which includes all components of a competency based system.&quot;</div>

<p><b>CRSP</b></p>
<p>The CRSP model is:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>· Personalized in that it responds to and supports individual learners as they become increasingly self-motivated and independent learners. The model is built around non-gradedness, continuous progress and individualized instruction and tracks each student from the point at which they enter the program to the point at which they exit with a credit.</p>
<p>· competency based in that it draws content from real life rather that cut across traditional subject lines of academic disciplines. Competencies written as applications of knowledge, skills and attitudes judged necessary to function in adult life.</p>
<p>· computer based in that it makes use of technology to deliver and manage instruction. The use of technology also allows the learner and advisors to manipulate large numbers and quantities of resource materials with a focus on that which is most valuable to an individual learner.</p>
<p>· a flexible structure is needed to support large numbers of individual learners.</p>
<p>Characteristics of the model include a flexible school day and flexible school year, the multiple entry and exit of students, variable instructional and learning time to accommodate the view that more students can succeed if additional time is allowed.</p>
<p>· Based on site-based management allows planning and decision-making to occur at the school level so that day to day administration can be collegial and collaborative.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>While the writer recognizes his biases, CRSP is thought to be the only model which includes all components of a competency based system.</p>

<p>Although I retired from the college system in 1987, I was active as a consultant for a number of years thereafter. One of the most interesting assignments was a contract to design a competency based model for implementation at the secondary school level. It was both a stimulating and challenging assignment. The result was The Canadian Restructured School Plan, CRSP, which was designed to provide "an alternative to the existing lock-step, teacher centered, classroom based delivery system."</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The methodology included the establishment of National Project Steering Committee, an extensive literature review, convening of three focus groups, visits to innovative schools throughout Canada, a survey of 40 recognized Canadian educational leaders and considerable discussion within the committee and between committee members and professional colleagues.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The report identified a number of major shifts occurring in education including a shift:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>· From a system whereby students are admitted to school on an annuls or semiannual basis, to a more open system in which there is flexible entry and exit;</p>
<p>· From a rigid time-bound credit structure to flexible competency-based curriculum in which time is not held constant;</p>
<p>· From the lock-step graded structure to a non-graded continuous progress, individualized approach;</p>
<p>· From an instructional mode that is teacher -centered to one that is learner centered and teacher directed/assisted/managed;</p>
<p>· To an evaluation system which reports student progress in percentages or letter grades, to one which reports on the competencies mastered and the level of mastery reached;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
