  3 Learning Map
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Don uses the analogy of roadmaps to learning, recalling childhood journeys with his family from Black River Bridge (New Brunswick) through Chatham to Bathurst (his father&#x27;s birthplace), traveling via the Frances Ullock ferry across the Miramichi. He advocates for &quot;learning maps&quot; to guide students through educational pathways, noting that Holland College introduced DACUM Charts in 1970 to provide students with overview of learning possibilities and progress tracking. This piece demonstrates his innovative approach to educational planning and student engagement.</div>

<p><i>A learning map</i></p>
<p><i>I cannot remember when I saw my first roadmap but it seems to me that it came out of the glove compartment every time we drove beyond Chatham, Nw runswick. Our map<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>revealed the road from home to Chatham, across the Miramichi on the ferry (Frances Ullock) and north on Route 8 to Bathurst – my father’s place of birth.</i></p>
<p><i>My father seldom looked at<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>the map; he had travelled this road many times before, but it was a point of conversation for other family members.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I still remember conversations about the Little Eskadellic, Big Eskadellic and Tabisintac Rivers and hills as we travelled northward. I sometimes wish my school had provided equivalent maps of the path through British History and the intricacies of algebra. My book case today contains a variety of maps, traditional and learning. They provide a record of where each student had been and some places yet unexplored.</i></p>
<p>In i970 Holland College introduced leaning maps (called DACUM Charts) to incoming students. They provide an overview of learning possibilities in the emerging learmning learning journey</p>
<p><i>learning maps provide learners with<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>the many individual components of their emerging education journey. They also were a place to review and record progress. Report the trip tor family, friends and other institutions and employers. They also provide<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>a ready reference should you need to recall the experience.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></i></p>
