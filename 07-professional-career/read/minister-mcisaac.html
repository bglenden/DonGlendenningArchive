<p>Minister McIssac</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Education</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>During the last few months, I have engaged many Islander, educators and retired educators, business operators, parents, colleagues and friendsin conversations about education; some I sought out but others sought me out to share both information.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Overwhelmingly there is an interest and desire for change; no one expressed support for the status quo.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As part of my information gathering, I reviewed<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>a number of reports about education and<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>my own conclusions reflect many of the conclusions of those reports.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I am sure that you are aware of the public calls for change in education , not only in PEI, but around the world and at all levels – and I expect those calls to become more strident.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>You may well argue that you, and your government has demonstrated your commitment to to education through new and upgraded facilities, increased number of teachers and improved salaries, an strengthened early childhood education program, increased postsecondary education, and the use of technology, and I would not be one to argue the contrary.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But the items that arise in my conversations are seldom, if ever, about more money; they are about doing business differently including engagement, standards, professional freedom and accountability independent learning, entrepreneurship to name bet a few.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We have built a system that is almost impervious to change, some external stimulus is needed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>While you may or may not agree, I believe that I am helping</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>and, in fact others who have me out , business retired educators, business comm whoAs part oDuring the past several months I have<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>and; Post Secondary Degrees</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Debate about the proposed Degree Granting Act provides the Government of Prince Edward Island with a wonderful opportunity to institute much needed changes in the education system and, while I frame my remarks around degrees, the same can be said about diplomas awarded by both colleges and the public school system.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I am not, Minister, trying to diminish the value of schooling and education.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Instead, I am advocating for greater flexibility on what constitutes education and better reporting to both learners and the public as well.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>As background, some personal views:</p>
<p>In my experience, the particular pattern of courses required for graduation cannot be defended in terms of later success in either university or real life</p>
<p>Diplomas and degrees represent the an institutions view as to what a person should study.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></p>
<p>The awarding of degrees and diplomas add little, if anything to education.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Instead, they extend programs, become hurdles instead of challenges reduce flexibility, increase costs restricts a student from exploring other subjects of interest or relevance to learner objectives.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>As an employer, I cannot ever remember asking an applicant to present evidence of having a degree.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Transcripts, on the other hand provide a measure of both the breadth and depth of study in a field – but it still provided little evidence about what the learner could do with what they knew. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>On the other hand, there may well be a need for qualifications but they should be awarded by a third party on application by the student and based on a separate assessment of performance.</p>
<p>The public school system is held hostage by the postsecondary system, especially by universities.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Teachers seem to think that the university system is the ideal system and operate to the extent possible on the same model.</p>
<p>Although no longer in touch with recent developments, I am impressed with the work of the<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>New Zealand Qualification Authority.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Theirs, I thought, was a good model although, unfortunately, they had to trade of some characteristics in order to gain the support of colleges and universities.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I have no personal objection, Minister, to allowing other institutions to offer diplomas and degrees, however, unless some changes are made, the new ones will be as irrelevant as the existing ones.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>You have an opportunity to make a significant intervention into the education system, to address issues that, I am sure, are brought to your attention by parents and taxpayers alike.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And you can do this, not by making grand announcements but simply by asking well constructed questions.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>If interested, I would be delighted to discuss these matters further</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Don Glendenning</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>There are many changes that one could suggest<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Allow students to challenge every course offering for credit</p>
<p>Deemphasize the need for degrees and replace them with evidence that they have the background necessary to perform the work to be done</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>In government hiring, base requirements on successful completion of relevant courses with no financial benefit to having a degree.the pattern of coignore a degree as a requirementIgnore whether or not a Disallow the use of a degree as</p>
<p>As a minimum, you could use the planned legislation as <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
