<div class="reader-summary">Substantive letter from Don to Ken Gillis (August 22, 2006) providing detailed feedback on IAHSP wind-up planning. Don emphasizes the importance of project timelines, requests greater detail on participant status and remaining completion requirements, and identifies needed wind-up activities including final reports and thank-you letters. He notes that John Robinson had been informed of the December 31, 2006 deadline and suggests this requires update if timeline changes. The letter demonstrates Don&#x27;s systematic project management approach and accountability to stakeholders.</div>

<p>Date:		August 22, 2006</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>To:		Ken Gillis</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>From:		Don Glendenning</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Subject:	IAHSP<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Sorry for the delay in responding; thanks for the draft paper on the windup of the IAHSP Program. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Inclusion of the timelines is important because they point out some of the restrictions to finishing on time that were not of our making. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Katy’s document mentions the likely status of each participant as of December 31.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I’d like to see more detail.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Specifically, what will remain for each participant to complete beyond the end of the contract?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The list should include their final reports.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>As Katy points out, there are also project wind-up activities – the settlement of accounts, the preparation of a final report, thank you letters and a wind-up of files.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>These also need to be identified in some detail.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Although Katy titles her draft “a report of possibilities”, in fact, the paper only offers one phase-out scenario and that deals only with project administration.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Assuming that this paper is for discussion purposes by the Board, I’d be inclined to deal first with wind-up activities of participants.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>With that clear in our mind, we can then turn our attention to winding up the project.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>You will recall that John Robinson met with the IAHSP Board some time ago to discuss our phase-out plans.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>At that time, he was told that the project would be wound up by December 31, 2006.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If this is no longer the case, John should be alerted so that discussions can commence with DOCH.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I hope these comments will be helpful.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Regards</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Don</p>
