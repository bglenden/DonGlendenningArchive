  1-Not the Fault of Teachers
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">An essay written March 20, 2005 (last updated December 14, 2005) in which Don defends teachers against systemic education shortcomings. He argues that public complaints about education—rigidity, lack of relevance, poor standards—are unfairly attributed to teachers when nearly half the education budget goes to non-salary items and system-level decisions constrain individual teacher autonomy. Don advocates for system-level changes from senior leadership (ministers and deputies) to empower teachers as professionals and improve educational resources available to learners.</div>

<p>First Draft: March 20, 2005</p>

<p><b>NOT THE FAULT OF TEACHERS</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>It doesn’t take long in any conversation to uncover a litany of complaints about education; it is rigid, lacks relevance, has low standards, does not accommodate individual needs, is expensive, does not prepare students for advanced levels, trains followers not leaders, lacks accountability, is weak on communication skills, poor work habits, and the list goes on.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The most recent litany usually starts with the low standing of Canadian schools on recent OECD tests.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I am sitting in the USA as I write this and, for what it is worth, OECD test results are of great concern here also.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>In the second breath, most complainants point to the causes as a short work year, short work days and time lost because of bad weather, holidays, teachers’ conventions and staff development and student-teacher ratio.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>To these, I would add accountability, relevance, flexibility, delivery model and standards.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>We ae more comfortable talking in some depth about health care needs such as strokes, gallbladders, breast cancer and obesity than we are about vocabulary, listening skills, self-learning and work habits. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Shortcomings of our education system are quickly laid at the feet of our teachers. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We seem to forget, or do not realize, that nearly half the education budget is spent on items other than teacher’s salaries and benefits.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In our discussions we refer to all as teachers when many educators should be more accurately labeled principals, guidance counselors, Board staff, Superintendents, Department Specialists and even the Minster or Deputy Minister not to mention the many people who provide administrative support, transportation, building maintenance, etc. While teachers may share the blame, they should not be held accountable for matters outside their control.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In the eyes of the public, all are teachers.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>This assignment of blame to teachers is unfair; teachers, themselves, would like to see changes but are powerless to make the changes that count.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Changes are outside the authority of the individual teacher.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Many of the barriers can only be removed by changes to the system and system changes require attention at higher levels.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>From my perspective, no other professional is as constrained in how he or she delivers help as is the individual teacher.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In fact, to a large degree, we have removed a teacher’s ability to be a professional. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>System change is not now, and will not be tomorrow, an easy task but that does not mean it should not be tackled.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The ultimate objective is to improve educational resources available to learners.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In terms of teachers, the objective is to design a system that will allow them to be the professionals they are capable of being. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>System changes require leadership at senior levels which probably means from the responsible Minister and Deputy.</p>
