  06 Principles
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">A foundational document outlining thirteen guiding principles for educational reform. Key principles include: education&#x27;s role is coaching and support; learning is demonstrated through doing; testing serves diagnosis and measurement; standards must be clearly defined and life-based rather than discipline-based; learners should challenge for credit anytime; assessment reflects performance only; and previous learning receives credit. These principles reveal Don&#x27;s learner-centered, pragmatic approach emphasizing flexibility, clear communication, and practical demonstration over traditional institutional hierarchies.</div>
