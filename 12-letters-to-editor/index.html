Comparing PEI to other departments: Agriculture structures around crops, animals, potatoes; Health around COVID, drugs, e-health, hospitals; Fisheries around angling, hunting, wildlife, trapping. PEI Education, however, organizes by levels (elementary, secondary, postsecondary) rather than branches of educational endeavor. Education creates experiences through which people develop knowledge, skills, attitudes, attributes—enabling language learning, road building, community thriving, health services, artistic creation. Schools should organize education; so should the Department leading them. The letter, despite a typo in the filename ("Brraches"), represents mature expression of Don's consistent message: departmental structure must reflect educational services and human development outcomes rather than institutional hierarchy.

The World Bank, largest public education contributor, cautions countries against confusing schooling with education. PEI does conflate them, focusing on serving youth in schools rather than all Islanders across ages, interests, and capabilities. Education is a service to help people gain/develop knowledge, skills, attitudes, values, and attributes; collaboration between educators and community is essential. Standard education services include information, counseling, learning products, technology, analysis, instruction, human resources, and tracking. Services should be clearly identified and promoted, with help tailored to individual learner needs. Restructuring should begin with: (1) common understanding of education; (2) clear purpose; (3) identified services. Don concludes by asserting PEI has internal expertise; it needs only to act on it rather than hiring external consultants. This letter synthesizes his reform vision into actionable steps.BIOGRAPHICAL<div class="expanded-file"><a href="../05-education-reform/read/a-dear-editor.html">Read</a> · <a href="../05-education-reform/files/A%20Dear%20Editor.docx">Download</a></div></div></td>

He argues the Department should lead public discussion on education's purpose, services, and standards through an "education plan."

Don defines education as a broad, lifelong process of acquiring knowledge while developing thinking, creativity, problem-solving, comprehension, and learning capacity, encompassing values, habits, and character development. School, by contrast, is a specific location offering education services, comparable to a hospital as a resource-rich site where teachers and learners meet. Don emphasizes this distinction is not semantic but functional: education is a process; school is a place. This clarity is essential because conflating them limits perception of educational possibilities to institutional settings, constraining community understanding of how learning occurs.BIOGRAPHICAL<div class="expanded-file"><a href="../05-education-reform/read/2-education-or-schooling.html">Read</a> · <a href="../05-education-reform/files/2%20Education%20or%20schooling%20.docx">Download</a></div></div></td>

Applied to PEI, he identifies the next right priority as developing "a clear and compelling vision of education for Islanders of all interests, all ages, all communities and all life roles—not just school-age Islanders." He urges establishing a vision-setting committee whose members are chosen for their views rather than constituent representation, and emphasizes that the Department must own the vision, not just adopt it.

Don challenges complacency, noting 42 percent of Canadian adults lack sufficient literacy for modern employment. Rather than assigning blame to systemic causes (literacy silos, staffing, resources, curriculum), he advocates for expert problem-solving, citing British Columbia's appointment of a Superintendent of Reading. Don calls reading a pandemic problem and literacy "the most valuable of school subjects," emphasizing most people can learn to read with proper support.
