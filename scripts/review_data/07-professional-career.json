The preparation for life\u2019s roles is called education and\nthe better prepared we are, the better we are able to cope with all\nthat we encounter or create.  That learning is complicated by the\nfact that each\nperson is unique; unique in our basic physical, mental, emotional and\nsocial make up, unique in our combination of previous experiences,\nunique in our perceived futures for ourselves, but unique also in\nterms of our pace and style of learning. Our education consists of\nwhat we have learned or perhaps, what we have retained from our\nlearning experiences, or even what we are able to do as a result of\nwhat we have learned\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is widely recognized that education\nis a key factor in determining each citizen\u2019s quality of life; in\nthe same way, the collective education of our citizens will determine\nto a significant degree the quality of the community in which we\nlive.  Recognizing all of the above, our communities invest heavily\nin programs and facilities; the state has two interests.  One is to\nencourage and support a high level of personal growth and development\nfor every citizen; the other is to ensure that our communities have\nthe skills needed to provide a quality of life that our citizens need\nand expect. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is a gap between what Islanders\nhave and what they want in the way of education.  This gap, the\nwriter believes, arises primarily from our sloppiness with the\nlanguage.  Let me explain.  Educators and the public at large tend to\nuse schooling and educationa interchangeablyThey do not do so with\nagriculture and farming, health and hospitals, justice a...",

Upon founding Holland College in 1969, he identified institutional flexibility as education's most pressing issue, addressing how educational systems had locked themselves into teaching models failing to reflect learning science. He describes Holland College's adoption and development of the DACUM model from Nova Scotia NewStart Corporation, valuing its learner-centered approach, relevant competencies, community interaction, cost-effectiveness, performance-based rating, continuing education tools, learner-teacher communication, and flexibility. Writing forty years later, Don identifies exit standards as the urgent contemporary challenge\u2014a gap between public expectations and system delivery. He cites Martin Haberman's research on the non-academic gap between school and employment. Don emphasizes the need for performance-based standards with clear exit outcomes, well-defined performance level descriptions, and recognized benchmarks, noting progress but indicating work remains.",

We adopted that model because it was learner centered,\u00a0 ensured that competencies were relevant, maximized interaction with the employing community, was cost effective, included a performance based rating scale, provided learners with a tool to aid in planning and recording continuing education, strengthened learner-teacher communication and met our need for flexibility. \u00a0\n\n\n\n\nForty years later, I am of the view that the most pressing issue in education today is that of exit standards.\u00a0 A gap exists between what the public expects and what system delivers.\u00a0 The promise of Outcomes Based Education has been replaced with the reality of curriculum objectives.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nThe non-academic gap between school and employm...",

Addresses education as most important societal issue and spans multiple sections: quality education characteristics (accessible, affordable, flexible, relevant, accountable, transparent), systemic gaps (lacks philosophy, suffers from politicization/bureaucracy), barriers to change, organizational problems (top-down, formula-driven, out of touch with clients), and proposed solutions. Includes Don's core beliefs about learner-centered delivery, distinguishing education from schooling, mathematics as prerequisite for opportunity, and need for external qualification authorities.

  "summary": "Don conceptualizes schools as incubators preparing young people for adult life roles. Drawing from the Oregon Education Act's six life roles (individual, learner, producer, consumer, family member, citizen), he argues all people benefit at some point from instructional support. He identifies the fundamental challenge: while schools fill important roles, society hasn't clearly expressed expectations about their function. Don contrasts business models (investment/consumer purchase) with education, which involves overlapping stakeholder interests (learners, service providers, investors, employers). He identifies a critical gap: educators measure quality by inputs (subjects, schooling years, institutions, instructor qualifications, technology, test scores) while taxpayers and employers judge by outputs\u2014what graduates can do. Schools measure input and infer performance; the public rates performance directly. Don argues little progress in raising standards will occur until these conflicting measurement frameworks are reconciled, requiring dialogue that aligns training program content with community standards.",

Teachers shape lives and help learners develop new attitudes, skills, and knowledge. Don emphasizes learning is individual\u2014only the learner can learn\u2014and teaching creates change conditions. He reiterates his core principle: \"A teacher hasn't taught if a learner hasn't learned,\" applied to each learner. Teachers stimulate learning through varied techniques: modeling, information provision, questioning, timelines, projects, field trips, and performance assessment. The crux of good teaching is creating favorable learning environments for each individual within group settings. Don notes schools organize around academic disciplines with assigned hours and teachers hired accordingly, resulting in report cards with subject ratings disconnected from life roles except future academic study. The essay implies this structure inadequately prepares learners for their actual future roles as individuals, learners, producers, consumers, family members, and citizens. The essay suggests a fundamental need to align schooling structures with adult life role preparation.",

Not surprising, a long list of ideas emerged with the\nfollowing being chief among them: gather\ninformation, analyze experiences, obtain feedback, take instruction,\nevaluate selves, coach others, practice, observe others, attend\nlectures, seek counselling and observe demonstrations. When asked\nabout the order in which help was needed, not surprisingly,\nstudents followed quite different paths.  As an example, one student\nsaid his first step would be to Google the topic; another said if it\ninvolved a new skill, he would probably attempt it first, while\nothers liked the traditional lecture as a place to start.  Since\npanel members were in school or recent graduates, much of the\ndiscussion revolved around gaining new knowledge rather than skills\nor attitudes.  Different purposes for learning did not substantially\nchange the range of help needed, although it may change the order and\nthe amount of time on the path. Since then, the Learning Path has\nbeen the subject of a number of both formal and informal\nconsultations.  The latest version can be found on the reverse side\nof this paper.

  "summary": "This letter (undated) addresses the Council of Ministers of Education, Canada (CMEC) regarding school-to-work transitions, disagreeing that the problem is primarily student-focused; Don attributes it to school system rigidity. He recommends surveying employers about needed competencies, consulting educators during curriculum outcomes identification, examining various curriculum development options, and switching assessment from traditional grades to externally-referenced criteria (matching school and real-life standards), as advocated by outcomes expert William Spadey. He urges CMEC to disconnect performance levels from grade levels and disconnect assessment from credentials in favor of qualifications, referencing qualification frameworks used in most developed countries.",
  "content_preview": "Dear Editor:\n\nTransition from school to work\n\n\n\n\nThe Council of Ministers of Education, Canada (CMEC) is concerned about the transition of students from school to work (CMEC, July 8, 2016); so am I, and so are many parents, grandparents and employers that I talk with.\u00a0 The media release implies that it\u2019s a student problem; I see it differently and believe that the problem stems from the rigidity of the school system.\u00a0 The CMEC plans to address the transition problem through a \u201cpan-Canadian student transitions reference framework\u2019; I\u2019m not sure what the phrase means but it sounds complicated, expensive and bureaucratic.\u00a0 Based on the above alone, I don\u2019t hold out much hope for improvement, however, in support of the Ministers\u2019 efforts, here are some observations on the matter arising from my experience in education and conversations with employers.\n\nIf schools are preparing young people to enter employment, why not survey employers as to competencies that they want or need in their workforce?\u00a0 Educators may also consider consultation during the identification of outcomes, representation on advisory committees, surveys of new workers and informal contact on regular basis. We need a more open curriculum development process; for example, I\u2019ve been looking for a description of the curriculum development process, a curriculum development handbook, standard lists of outcomes and/or competencies and even plain research on the various options. So far, I\u2019m still looking. \u00a0\n\nThe use of outcomes as a basis for curriculum development demands changes in the way we measure and report student achievement. William Spadey, an outcomes guru, refers to the need for \u00a0 \u201cexternally referenced criteria\u201d when measuring performance; that means using the same or similar criteria in school as are used outside school (in real life).\u00a0 The switch from traditional assessment is not an easy one but the benefits of using outcomes cannot be realized without it.\n\n\n\n\nMore needs to be done to remove the...",

This\nresulted in a single-sheet presentation of competencies which could\nbe used by a variety of users.  Adams went further and outlined a\ntraining model based on the DACUM model.

Because of this, we are among the world leaders in our investment in ensuring that our citizens, especially our youth, have access to a variety of educational activities and experiences.\u00a0 Our education system developed over decades and served us well, however, there are significant changes occurring around us that demand some different responses; our education system is unlikely to make the desired changes by itself.\u00a0 But there is a gap between what Islanders have and what they want in the way of education.\u00a0 Not only is there a gap, but Islanders want meaningful engagement in bringing about the change. There is no panacea in sight and there is not likely to be one, however, change must be immediate, significant and continuous, but planned. Most comment is focused on changes to the school system, however, the issue is broader than that, it must encompass not only schools, but the broader education including the role of the home and community; any review must also include a variety of issues including expectations, the need for collaboration and engagement, credentials and standards, personal freedom and accountability.\n\nI\u2019ve spent most of...",

Accord one Island educator with whom I spoke with whom I spoke, the practice of requiring new employees to have a degree, whether needed or not is alive PEI as well.\n\nThe emphasis, it is said, arises for a number of reasons \u2013 degrees adds prestige to the company, are a simple screening device, sometimes reflects high rates of unemployment, people wanting to remain on PEI; potential for company growth and perhaps to give priority to Islanders. Many employers associate degrees with soft\u00a0 skills,\n\nThe article certainly raises questions about whether simply\u00a0 preference. As one questioner pointed, \u201cJobs don\u2019t require college degrees; employers do.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nMedia reports on difficulty of finding candidates with skills they need but no evidence they are hiring based on skills needed.\n\n\n\n\nArticle caused me to skim\u00a0 PEI job advertisements \u00a0\n\n\u00a0Susanna Williams was quoted in one of the articles as pointing out that",

He laments insufficient focus on the teaching-learning process during his training and advocates every school should publish a learning model focused on learner activities (not teacher activities). He provides a practical exercise: sketch steps from course entry to exit, sequence them, identify optional paths, and ask how you know the sequence is correct.

Don cautions that while PISA provides useful feedback and international comparison, test results should not drive all educational decisions. He highlights an OECD survey of 11 participating countries showing that schools with greater autonomy tend to perform better on PISA. Critically, Don notes that when schools account publicly for results through achievement data, greater autonomy correlates with better performance, but without accountability arrangements, autonomous schools can perform worse. This balanced perspective reflects Don's sophisticated understanding of educational governance. The newsletter reminds readers of the January 20 workshop on youth preparedness and directs readers to OECD resources.

He connects DACUM (occupational analysis) to broader \"life roles\" (learner, producer, citizen, family member, consumer), proposing a outcomes hierarchy: life roles, occupation, general competencies, specific competencies, elaborations.

He identifies political context challenges (politicization within government departments affecting long-term planning), mission ambiguity, organizational structure limitations, insufficient autonomy, unclear accountability, fragmented culture treating education as product rather than service, and inadequate instructional support materials. Don argues that many functions should delegate to schools and intermediary bodies, citing OECD evidence that student performance improves with school autonomy. He advocates treating education as a service to learners rather than a product to deliver, emphasizing learner-centered rather than teacher-centered support materials.

The document outlines DACUM methodology, provides rating scales and performance levels, lists strengths (shifting focus from content to learner) and weaknesses (confusion between outcomes and levels), and includes Atlantic Canada's Essential Graduation Learnings and verb taxonomy aligned with Bloom's taxonomy. Reflects Don's systematic approach to educational philosophy and methodology.",

In my own mind, the two are soul\nmates with OBE being the broad descriptor when speaking of education\nand competencies being a description of the outcome at the interface\nwith a learner.  I must hasten to add, however, that this is a\npersonal view rather than one shared broadly in the profession.  It\nis not surprising, therefore, that even a quick scan of websites of\nProvincial Departments of Education, quickly reveals the extent to\nwhich educational planning has been influenced by the Outcomes Based \nEducation movement, especially in the area of curriculum development.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAcademic\neducators then, and mostly still today, focused on content,  that is\ndividing subjects such as mathematics, literature, science  and so\nforth into courses and lectures for the purpose of teaching and\nlearning. At the time was that small cadre of educators who laboured\nin the field of vocational education; their instructional efforts\nalways started with an occupational analysis and the adoption of CBE\nwas a natural fit with their practice.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPromoters\nof OBE proposed to organize education, or perhaps more accurately\nthat part of education that occurs in schools, around educational\noutcomes and to measure change based on performance regardless of\nwhen the learning took place.  The proponent, and self-proclaimed\nexpert, was William Spady, a sociologist xxxat the University and for\na while, a professor at the Ontario Institute for Studies in\nEducation in Toronto.  According to Spady, outcomes could be written\nwith \u201ctraditional,\nt...",

One\u2019s\neducation, at least the part experienced in school, became the study\nof a series of discrete experiences too seldom integrated into a\ncoherent life related whole.

The full plan of glenway was apparent from the beginning to everyone who wished to purchase a lot;\n\nRoadways, accesses .covenants, middle lots , common grounds.\n\n\n\n\nLast year glenway roads, accesses, common ground was turned over to the association of lot owners in good faith that care would be taken for the benefit of the owners.\n\n\n\n\nMy take on Linda having access on our road\u00a0 is this.\n\nBy now Linda would already have the 14 foot\u00a0 road access on the McInnis\u2019s own property\n\nAnd her property lot if it were important\u00a0 to any of them. They would not wait for\n\nFor us to change our mind. Therefore I think this request is a red herring and an opening for the McInnis\u2019s to make further requests.",

It was interesting to notice how frequently Canada was mentioned in DACUM entries and I certainly concluded that having been trained or certified by the CVA gave practitioners a leg up on the competition.\n\n\n\n\nThe view that DACUM originated in Iowa is widespread, and incorrect. Neither the term DACUM nor the process of identifying competencies has any roots in Iowa.\u00a0 If Iowa is to be given credit for anything it is for using a single sheet of paper to show modules to be learned.\u00a0 Here\u2019s what my research turned up:\n\n\n\n\nIn the mid-1960\u2019s Canada decided to establish an experimental project in each province aimed at unemployed youth; each project was given considerable freedom to operate at the local\u00a0 level;\u00a0 probably in late 1967, Robert Adams, an occupational analyst in the Federal Training Branch in Ottawa, was appointed as a member of the Nova Scotia NewStart team\n\nTo support the experimental projects initiative, the Federal Government established a project support unit in Ottawa; probably in 1968, Howard Clement, a former Director of the Vocational Curriculum Development Branch in British Columbia became Director\n\nOfficials from Ottawa visited a number of training sites in the USA including a Job Corps Program in Clinton, Iowa.\u00a0 There they saw a one-sheet curriculum, used...",

  "content_preview": "Response from Bridge\n\nGood evening Don,\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nHere are some initial thoughts:\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n1. CRA is interested in your \"purposes\" and activities. The word \"purposes\" is also used in the Canada Not-for-profit Corporations Act under which you are incorporated. Your purposes appear in your Articles of Incorporation and Articles of Amendment when you revise them. They are the formal legal words that define what you are all about.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nI recommend you not use the words \"objective,\" \"mission\" or \"vision.\" This causes confusion for the CRA.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n2. Have you studied the CRA's sample purposes wording? Here is a link\u00a0http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/chrts-gvng/chrts/pplyng/mdl/mdl-bjcts-eng.html\u00a0that gives examples of what they look for. They are very particular about the way the purposes are crafted. I recommend you follow the samples as closely as possible.\n\n\n\n\n3. CRA \u00a0may not like your reference to policy makers in your purposes. They may consider it to be a political purpose, which is prohibited. Here is the guidance that addresses this topic:\u00a0http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/chrts-gvng/chrts/plcy/cps/cps-022-eng.html\n\n\n\n\n4. I think the CRA will want more than bullets describing your activities. I generally craft 4 or 5 pages of prose to tell the story completely and clearly.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nThat's all for now.\n\n\n\n\nRichard\n\n\n\n\nOn Fri, Sep 5, 2014 at 4:21 PM, Don Glendenning <pei@education2020.ca> wrote:\n\nAs discussed, attached is a copy of my response to Question 11 \u2013 Objectives and activities;\u00a0\n\nI am also attaching a copy of our Vision statement.\n\n\u00a0\n\nAs I understand it, in return fro your review and comments, you will invoice us for an hour of your professional time.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nI look forward to hearing from you\n\n\u00a0\n\nThanks and regards\n\n\u00a0\n\nDon Glendenning",

  "title": "2016 CVA Strategy Summit",
  "summary": "These notes from a 2016 CVA Strategy Summit reflect Don's perspective on the association's history, current status, and future directions. Don notes the CVA's unique individual (not institutional) membership model, broad cross-sector participation, historical government partnership roles, and the 1970 emergence of ACCC which drew administrators toward institutional funding. He observes vocational education's shift from content-based to performance-measured definitions and the federal government's reduced leverage for change. Don argues the CVA could become a catalyst for educational change, particularly around \"transition\" from school to employment. Responding to summit questions about high points, current functioning, and future vision, Don emphasizes the value of personal networking and provincial connections developed at annual conferences. He proposes federal-provincial initiatives using \"transition\" as an organizing concept and questions whether the CVA could help coordinate training initiatives across regions.",

  "summary": "This foundational document outlines Don's vision for meaningful educational transformation focused on learner outcomes rather than system structure. It emphasizes the critical need for change in PEI's education system, advocating for outcome-based education, flexible scheduling, establishment of a separate qualification authority, and professional education advisors. Don contrasts the gap between what Islanders have and what they want in education, calling for immediate, significant, and continuous planned change. The document proposes bundled interventions including criterion-based assessment, flexible schedules enabling learners to progress at individual pace, and separation of teaching from qualification functions. Don positions himself as an experienced educator and concerned citizen ready to suggest practical improvements based on decades in the field.",

  "summary": "Dated April 11, 2012, this document presents Don's comprehensive framework for enabling educational change. It identifies widespread calls for reform both within and outside the profession, listing systemic issues including bureaucratic governance, lack of learner centeredness, and insufficient innovation support. The paper details critical change elements (change agents, action systems, innovation proposals, action plans) and outlines implementation steps from identifying problems through evaluating progress. Don discusses organizational change theory, emphasizing cultures fostering innovation, collaboration, and risk tolerance. The document includes the \"Education First\" framework based on the Oregon Education Act of 1991, defining education as formative life experiences and quality as functional ability across life roles.

Describes how tablets and cameras would enhance outdoor learning documentation, enable child-directed research, support independence, and allow educators to better track developmental progress in natural learning environments.",
  "content_preview": "Dear Selection Committee:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs an early childhood educator employed at Down to Earth Child Care, I believe that the centre (staff and children alike) could benefit greatly from increased opportunity to use technology.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\tOutdoor play is a core piece of our philosophy and combining technology with this could only enhance it. Every day the children play outdoors and discover all that it has to offer; including flowers, insects, birds, tree climbing, and so much more. Adding technology to this experience would allow children to document the things that interest them through photos and research areas of interest with the help of educators to produce immediate results and learning about a breadth of topics chosen by children. Currently this cannot happen as promptly or readily as we would like as we do not have many pieces of technology and children can change activities and focus very quickly, particularly outdoors. We are not able to conduct any research outdoors with the children other than taking photos with a camera.\n\n\n\n\n\tTechnology can also be used as a tool for accessing songs, books, or videos for the children. The children could choose the thing that they wanted to listen to or watch on their own. This could be used if a child feels they need a break from others, wants to sing, dance, do something new or has an idea they want to explore. This would provide a great opportunity for independence and choice for the children, for example, they would not have to ask an educator to play a certain CD for them.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\tGaining these tools would allow children to learn the skills to complete a goal or plan they have in mind along with the cognitive skills necessary to gather information and think more deeply about what it is they are doing and want to do next. They will also be able to carry a topic from one day to another as it will remain there for them to return to, unlike something such as a toy which must be cleaned up at the end of the day.\n\n\n\n\n\tIncreased t...",

Includes detailed appendix with reading competencies from North Carolina Conference of English Instructors covering comprehension, analysis, interpretation, language/style, and research competencies.

He recalls being a teacher before understanding pedagogy deeply, attributing this partly to his circumstances: small high school background, brief six-month initial training, youth, and one-room schoolhouse experience. Later, through formal study and varied professional experiences, his understanding deepened. Don describes using the provocative statement \"If the learner hasn't learned, the teacher hasn't taught\" in teacher education settings, which animated debate. He defends this principle against objections by noting that while learning may occur in groups, it is inherently individual\u2014teachers must succeed with each learner, not groups.",

This kind of assessment provides\n\t\tinformation for improving learning and teaching and is an\n\t\tinteractive process between student and teacher designed to inform\n\t\tboth learner and teacher how well their students are learning what\n\t\tteachers are teaching. The information is used by teachers to make\n\t\tchanges in what will be taught next and when, where, how and even\n\t\twhy.  It is considered feedback to students, shared fully and\n\t\tprobably confidentially, unique to each learner, course or incident\n\t\tbased and sometimes anonymous and not connected to passing or\n\t\tgrading.\n\t\t\n\n\n\t\tEvaluation\n\t\tor summative assessment is used to establish a person\u2019s level of\n\t\tachievement or performance in a subject or field.

  "summary": "Don distinguishes between assessment (gathering information for improvement in dialogue with learners) and grading (applying standardized measurement to determine achievement levels). He argues grading is inherently a regulatory function and may damage teacher-student relationships if teachers perform it.

Proposes an Atlantic Qualification Authority to serve the region, potentially hosted in PEI. Reports significant reader response to his earlier \"Grades as Capitalism\" article with mixed support and varying viewpoints.

  "summary": "Don proposes that all schools, colleges, and universities offering courses for credit should allow students to challenge for credit without formal enrollment. Educational institutions already assess prior learning (especially experiential), award advanced standing, and allow some students to skip grades. Don's personal experiences include exemption from a foreign language course and direct university entry from Grade 11. His proposal extends these practices universally. He argues this is crucial because society is \"driven by credentials\" available primarily through educational institutions, yet individuals acquire knowledge outside formal enrollment. Allowing challenge examinations would enable students to validate learning from any source\u2014work experience, self-study, non-traditional training\u2014and obtain essential credentials.",

He contrasts schooling (formal institutional training) with education (broader development of abilities and positive behavior values in society). Don uses educational dictionary definitions and references George Bernard Shaw and Canadian business leaders to illustrate the confusion between these concepts. He argues that education encompasses learning from home, church, community, and experience\u2014not just schools.

He provides a step-by-step guide for drafting an \"ideal\" learning model: marking entry and exit points, mapping all steps and their sequences, including optional and required components, and identifying alternate pathways.

About the same\ntime on stormy days, the local radio would announce school closings\nbecause of snow, ice, or high winds.  Frequently, by 9:00 am the\nstorm would have subsided or not developed and traffic along our\nstreet would be almost normal.  And shortly thereafter, children\nwould be building forts or tunnels, or pelting snowballs at passers\nby.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSchools\nclosings are based on a concern for student comfort and safety; that\nI understand.  There are days when it may not be safe for anyone to\nbe on the road except emergency vehicles.

If we can differentiate hospital and health care, surely we can do the \n\nsame for education and schooling.

  "summary": "A reflective account of Holland College's innovative STEP (Systematic Training and Education Program) approach to student performance assessment. Don credits Robert Adams of Nova Scotia NewStart Corporation with developing the DACUM-based performance rating scale, distinguishing it from traditional school evaluation. The essay outlines seven principles of expert supervisory judgment that informed DACUM development: supervisors sense satisfaction through simultaneous factors; they assess by observation and subjective judgment; competent supervisors recognize good work; they avoid single-instance judgments; they base recognition on demonstrated performance, not knowledge; they observe problem-solving processes; and they don't require rigid criteria. Don describes Holland College's implementation: learners self-rate upon entry and throughout, engage in learning plans with instructors, receive confirmation ratings, and understand greatest learning occurs when ratings change. He credits instructors' occupational backgrounds for understanding this performance-based approach, establishing a best practice for competency-based training.",
  "content_preview": "Assessing Student Performance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPerhaps the most unique aspect of the STEP approach was how student\u2019s performance was rated; it was truly performance based.\u00a0 No other educational institution that I know had implemented a performance based rating scale and, based on a survey of private industry, industrial based training programs do not use competency based rating either.\u00a0 Along with the DACUM analysis, Holland College adopted and later modified the DACUM rating scale.\n\n\n\n\nTraditionally, school evaluation systems relate only to the acquisition of knowledge in a school setting.\u00a0 Performance based rating is different; it is based in the reality of the real life work situation where application of knowledge, or performance, is the rule.\u00a0 The criteria and levels of learner performance are the same as, or at least reflect, those of the workplace.\u00a0 Learning is measured by observable behaviour of the kind that an immediate supervisor would recognize in a work situation.\u00a0 The evaluation process is simple, clear, easily understood by both employer and employee alike and is directly applicable to trainees preparing to work in an occupation or field.\n\n\n\n\nRobert Adams of Nova Scotia NewStart corporation, the primary architect of the DACUM system, developed a performance based rating scale based on the view that:\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n1.\tSupervisors are able to sense their satisfaction or dissatisfaction with a task being performed. A number of factors may be combined simultaneously, such as speed with which a task is performed, the quality of the work that is visible, and the usefulness of the product being built, yet the good supervisor is able to make judgments about his satisfaction with performance involving a number of such assessment factors.\n\n\n\n\n2.\tSupervisors assess performance by observation, followed by a rather subjective expert decision or judgment.

Argues schools need autonomy over curriculum, assessment, staffing, calendar, and budget allocation; teachers need freedom to make individualized instructional decisions and assign grades; students should choose schools and challenge courses for credit. Includes PEI-specific analysis noting School Act limitations on principal authority and proposes expanding decision-making at school level. Discusses Arizona school transformation converting teaching positions to assistant roles and Vancouver \"Miniversity\" alternative model. Emphasizes benefits including stronger community links, improved student results, and educational quality.

  "content_preview": "The Five Pillars\n\nBishop Carrol High School\n\nCalgary, Alberta\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndependent Study\n\nAll material for courses is assembled into self-study packages known as Learning Guides. These guides tell students exactly what they must learn, show them how to learn it and prepare them for testing and evaluation. Some activities that are included as part of the Learning Guides are: reading books, viewing videos, responding to questions and assignments, completing self-tests, conducting experiments and various other educational activities depending on the subject.\n\n\n\n\nThe Learning Guides also provide many opportunities for students to collaborate with each other by directing them to engage in team work, seminars and group presentations which are aimed at enhancing the student\u2019s learning.\n\n\n\n\nIndependent learning is supported through one-to-one consultations with teachers that are subject area specialists. They are always available and willing to meet with students to help them achieve their learning guide objectives.\n\n\n\n\nThe ultimate goal of independent study is to foster a sense of ownership of the knowledge learned. If successful, the student will understand how to learn, which is an important skill for post-secondary education.\n\n\n\n\nTeacher Advisor (TA) Role\n\nIn Bishop Carroll\u2019s unique learning environment students must exercise a considerable amount of responsibility in order to be successful. However, students are not alone in this responsibility. Their success is also the responsibility of their Teacher Advisor who works with them to develop an academic plan which reflects the student\u2019s unique needs and goals.\n\n\n\n\nEach of our students are assigned a TA who they will remain with until graduation. Students will meet with Teacher Advisors twice daily and for a longer period every week. It is the TA\u2019s duty to help the student set goals, motivate them, make sure they are keeping on track with their learning program and stay in touch with parents. The TA will also record lea...",

The document explains six cognitive levels: Remember (lowest), Understand, Apply, Analyze, Evaluate, and Create (highest).

The Toronto District School Board added nine elementary academies last month to its arsenal of 41 boutique schools, while Peel, one of Ontario\u2019s fastest-growing boards, is looking at expanding its suite of specialized programs. In Alberta, the government has responded with enthusiasm to the idea that since 1994, non-profit organizations and companies have created dozens of charter schools. There are also a range of specialized public schools, including some just for hockey devotees.\n\nYet, in a school board north of Toronto, an arts program is faced with closing because some trustees say it is elitist and not the right fit for children of elementary school age.\n\nThe arts program at Baythorn Public School in York Region has integrated a blend of dance, music and visual art with the Ontario curriculum for 25 years, and the demand for entry remains high. However, the administration has raised concerns that Grade 5 may be too early to specialize, and the school\u2019s audition requirement means it\u2019s not equally accessible to all children.\n\nParents are fighting tooth and nail to save their arts school \u2013 so many showed up at a public meeting on the issue last week that they couldn\u2019t fit in the meeting room. They say that, instead of facing the chopping block, the program should be expanded across the region. On the issue of access, they suggest the admissions criteria be replaced by a lottery system.\n\nOn the opposing side, trustee Diane Giangrande says elementary schools should be focused on broad-based foundational skills.

  "content_preview": "Canada Treasury Board Service Standard\n\nWhat Is a Service Standard\n\nA service standard is a public commitment to a measurable level of performance that clients can expect under normal circumstances.\n\nWhat are \"Normal Circumstances\"?\n\nWhen developing service standards, the organization should consider its resources and expected level of demand for regular day-to-day service operations (normal circumstances). Special circumstances where regular service standards may not apply include holidays, the end of April for tax filing, natural disasters, or emergencies. These are circumstances that are typically not within the organization's control.\n\n\n\n\nWhy Are Service Standards Important?\n\nService standards are integral to good client service and to effectively managing performance. They help clarify expectations for clients and employees, drive service improvement, and contribute to results-based management. Service standards reinforce government accountability by making performance transparent, and increase the confidence of Canadians in government by demonstrating the government's commitment to service excellence.\n\n\n\n\nService standards serve two key purposes:\n\n\n\n\nTo provide staff with performance targets (\"Phone must be answered within three rings\"); and\n\nTo inform clients what to expect (\"Waiting time is less than 10 minutes\").\n\nMany organizations have implemented service standards that serve these purposes. Examples are included in Appendix A.\n\n\n\n\nA service standard should be linked to an operational performance target or the frequency to which the organization expects to meet the service standard. The target takes into account the risks associated with process delays and uncertainties arising from factors such as workload fluctuations, staff movements, and seasonal variations.\n\n\n\n\nThe purpose of the target is to help manage operations and track progress against overall delivery objectives.

The requested changes have not been dealt with yet.\u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\n\n\nI have discussed the Foundation\u2019s interest in changes to the agreement with the Deputy and, during our most recent discussion, offered to expedite the process through providing a draft agreement for his consideration. \u00a0\n\n\n\n\nOn reflection, I drafted two agreements.\u00a0 The first provides administration of the Carver scholarship as an \u201cAgency Fund\u201d which means that the Government of Prince Edward Island can withdraw the funds from the foundation at any time. (Annex 5).\u00a0 The other is our more standard agreement under which the Foundation would administer the Carver Scholarship in perpetuity (Annex 6).\u00a0 We are comfortable with either but prefer the latter.\n\n\n\n\nA copy of both agreements will be sent to you electronically.\n\n\n\n\nWe would appreciate your advice on the wording of the agreement and, frankly, any assistance you can give to bring the matter to an early resolution.\n\n\n\n\nPlease do not hesitate to let me know if you need further information.\n\n\n\n\nSincerely\n\n\n\n\nDon Glendenning\n\nDirector",

Don argues individuals differ in experiences, interests, learning styles; choice-making is an important educational skill; individuals should take responsibility for choices; consumer choices drive service improvement. Contrasts limited educational choice with choice available in other sectors (church, professional services). References Bay County (Florida) School Authority 2005 open enrollment example. Proposes four choice dimensions: School choice (location), teacher choice (chemistry between teacher and student), scheduling choice (flexibility in time spent in school), and graduation date choice (based on competency not age). Argues choice removes excuses, increases accountability, and creates window of opportunity for system transformation. Notes Alberta's variety of school types (public, private, charter, religious, specialty arts/hockey) all open to residents. Emphasizes that most other services are similarly limited in small communities, so rural constraints shouldn't prevent choice. Well-reasoned argument with practical implementation suggestions.",

  "summary": "University of Alberta academic paper by Elaine Simmt exploring mathematics education's role in citizenship education. Argues mathematics has potential to help students understand society and their role in shaping it. Examines mathematization of society (quantification, statistical thinking, mathematical modeling) and questions whether math education develops critical citizens who understand these invisible structures. Critiques traditional math instruction (facts/skills, right/wrong emphasis) as subverting citizenship goals. Proposes instructional approaches: variable-entry prompts encouraging problem-posing, demand for explanation/justification, mathematical conversations emphasizing collaboration and collective problem-solving. Positions math as essential to informed, active citizenship in mathematized society.",
  "content_preview": "CITIZENSHIP EDUCATION IN THE CONTEXT OF SCHOOL MATHEMATICS\n\nElaine Simmt, University of Alberta\n\nAbstract\n\n\n\n\nThis paper suggests that mathematics has a role in citizenship education because it has the potential to help us understand our society and our role in shaping it. Through an examination of ways the study of mathematics can help students to identify and pose problems, the author argues that mathematics education is crucial in the development of informed, active and critical citizens in a society whose structures are largely mathematical.\n\nWhat does mathematics education have to offer civics education?\n\nOn one hand, if we believe that mathematics is harmless and innocent because it has little to do with the world we live in, then we might simply respond that mathematics education does not have a role in civic education outside of offering some form of mental stimulation or exercise for the mind. However, even the pure mathematician agrees that mathematics is part of our human experience (Hardy, 1967; Davis and Hersch, 1981). As Keith Devlin notes, \"the study of mathematics is ultimately the study of humanity itself\" (Devlin, 1998, 9).\n\nOn the other hand, the applied mathematician would claim that his or her work is all about the world in which we live (Davis and Hersch, 1981) and that the role of mathematics in society has grown more and more significant in recent decades (D'Ambrosio, 1999). At the same time, one could argue that the mathematization of society \"has become more and more hidden from view, forming an invisible universe that supports much of our lives\" (Devlin, 1998, 12). If either the purist or the applied mathematician's observations about mathematics reflect the nature of mathematics, then it is important to consider the role that mathematics education could play in citizenship education because either an education in mathematics will help us understand ourselves or it will help us understand the world in which we participate. Of course, it co...",

Developed in his post-retirement consulting work (after 1987), the model was designed to be an alternative to \"lock-step, teacher-centered, classroom-based delivery.\" The document describes major shifts embodied in CRSP: from fixed admission schedules to flexible entry/exit; from time-bound to competency-based curriculum; from graded to non-graded continuous progress; from teacher-centered to learner-centered; and from percentage-based to competency-based reporting. Glendenning claims it's \"the only model which includes all components of a competency based system.\"",

The model is built around non-gradedness, continuous progress and individualized instruction and tracks each student from the point at which they enter the program to the point at which they exit with a credit.\n\n\u00b7 competency based in that it draws content from real life rather that cut across traditional subject lines of academic disciplines. Competencies written as applications of knowledge, skills and attitudes judged necessary to function in adult life.\n\n\u00b7 computer based in that it makes use of technology to deliver and manage instruction. The use of technology also allows the learner and advisors to manipulate large numbers and quantities of resource materials with a focus on that which is most valuable to an individual learner.\n\n\u00b7 a flexible structure is needed to support large numbers of individual learners.\n\nCharacteristics of the model include a flexible school day and flexible school year, the multiple entry and exit of students, variable instructional and learning time to accommodate the view that more students can succeed if additional time is allowed.\n\n\u00b7 Based on site-based management allows planning and decision-making to occur at the school level so that day to day administration can be collegial and collaborative.\n\n\n\n\nWhile the writer recognizes his biases, CRSP is thought to be the only model which includes all components of a competency based system.\n\n\n\n\n* Canadian Vocational Association, Canadian Restructured School Plan, and Ottawa: The Association, 1993,221 pp.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough I retired from the college system in 1987, I was active as a consultant for a number of years thereafter.

  "summary": "A creative thought experiment where Glendenning imagines himself as education czar with absolute authority to implement five transformative changes: (1) assigning each student a permanent educational advisor (like a family doctor) responsible for guidance through K-12; (2) separating teaching and credentialing functions into distinct organizations (like City and Guilds); (3) allowing learners choice of any teacher/school with student transportation; (4) replacing teacher compensation based on knowledge and experience with performance-based pay reflecting work done, complexity, and merit; and (5) replacing Department of Education bureaucracy with accountability to teachers for student learning. The piece reveals Don's frustrations with institutional inertia while offering concrete reform proposals grounded in his philosophy.",

I find that it is not teachers but rather administrators and teachers' unions that are most likely to oppose change.\n\n\n\n\nMy initial list was a long one and included such changes as placing more freedom and accountability at the individual school level, clearer standards, clearer differentiation of levels of performance, clearer lines of accountability, more freedom for teachers to make professional decisions, changing the emphasis from time served to performance, emphasizing communication skills and merit pay.\u00a0 Introducing those changes would be more than one could accomplish in one day so I decided to limit myself to five.\u00a0 Here they are:\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst would be to require each student to have an \u201ceducation advisor\u201d with a role similar to that of a family doctor.\u00a0 Most of us would not be very happy if we had a new family doctor each year, especially if it was not of our choosing.\u00a0 The education advisor would, for the most part, provide advice and direction for at least K through 12, however, students could elect to change advisors but advisors would have no choice in selecting students except because of a heavy workload.\u00a0 As with a family doctor, the educational advisor would work with a learner and advice and direct the learner in a course of action intended to meet the learner\u2019s educational goals; an educational advisor would also have authority to place students with specialist teachers as necessary. \u00a0 Student transcripts would be signed off by the educational advisor. \u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecond, I would separate the teaching and the sorting functions, that is, if degrees and diplomas are thought to be important, set up one ...",

Don argues that education improvement requires three foundational changes: increased public engagement through unaligned organizations (like those prevalent in health), market-based delivery systems enabling school choice and teacher innovation, and continuous progress models replacing age-based cohort systems. He critiques the current system as bureaucratic, inflexible monopoly failing to accommodate individual learner needs or employ customer service principles. The proposal argues for early childhood as distinct from education, expanded life skills focus, and structural separation of instruction from assessment/credentialing.

He argues learners are responsible for their own learning (with parental support), but government's prescriptive education model shifts responsibility from family to bureaucracy. Don critiques that education leadership has imposed their model on citizens while assuming responsibility for defining what should be learned and when. He notes the gap: unlike health or justice, limited independent guidance exists for parents and learners about next steps, resulting in young people entering work or post-secondary education unprepared.

  "summary": "This proposal introduces the \"math ladder\" concept\u2014a framework with clearly identified rungs representing known levels of mathematical achievement. Don argues that the practice of social promotion prevents meaningful comparison of skill levels across institutions and inhibits employers' ability to evaluate applicants effectively. The solution involves creating a mathematical ladder (comparable to music or skating certification levels) with independently assessed achievement levels. The ladder would establish common standards, aid labor mobility, and reduce curriculum development workload. Why math specifically: it has identifiable structure (numeracy through infinite series) but lacks widely accepted competency analyses and level agreements.",

The committee established that the math gap is real and has severe economic consequences: reduced quality of life, lower productivity, higher unemployment, lower product quality, reduced wages, and poor customer service. Root causes identified include differing perceptions of institutional roles, silo mentalities, problematic curriculum development models, and education politicization. The proposal establishes an independent assessment service certifying proficiency in everyday mathematics skills.

One of the most frequently mentioned concerns\nby Islanders is the low literacy levels among adults as reported via\nPISA results, recent CFPEI survey of Island Youth,\npresentation to the Standing Committee by the Charlottetown Area\nChamber of Commerce, presentations to Government by both the\nSummerside and Charlottetown Chambers of Commerce, a 2014 survey by\nthe PEI Home and School Federation and a series of workshops on\nPreparedness held throughout PEI by Education 20/20 Inc.  The\nmost frequently mentioned concern among Islanders, and especially\namong employers, is the low level of basic skills, especially\nmathematics, writing, communication and personal management skills. \nThe Mathematics Gap initiative is a further step in our exploration\nof math skills needed to function in a modern economy. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSteering\nCommittee:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn recent weeks a\nsmall  group of interested people have come together to explore the\nissue with a view to identifying action, if any, that can/should be\ntaken; mmembers of the Committee include:\n\n\t\n\nDr. Regis\n\tDuffy,\n\t\n\nJoan Macdonald \n\t\n\t\n\nDr. Tess\n\tMiller, \n\t\n\t\n\nTom\n\tWhite-Hassler, \n\t\n\t\n\nAnn Greyborn \n\t\n\t\n\nDon Glendenning\n\t\n\nRory Francis \n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConclusions:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBriefly stated, the\ncommittee believes:\n\n\t\n\nThe gap is real\n\t\n\nThe result of\n\tthe gap is a reduced quality of life for Islanders, reduced\n\tproductivity for Island businesses, high than necessary unemployment\n\trate, lower quality of PEI products, lower wages and poorer customer\n\tservice.\n\t\n\nThe gap is\n\thaving an economic and social impact on both the Island economy and\n\tthe future well-being of our young people\n\t\n\n The nature and\n\textent of the gap has not been fully described\n\t\n\nThe g...",

  "content_preview": "DACUM:\nA CANADIAN ACHIEVEMENT\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDraft\n\nThe\ndecade of industrial expansion immediately after WW2 was made\npossible by the influx of skilled immigrants from Western Europe.  By\nthe late 1950\u2019s, however, it became evident that Canada could no\nlonger depend on this source of supply. Furthermore, large numbers of\nCanadians remained unemployed even though Canada suffered from a\nshortage of skilled workers.  The Technical and Vocational Training\nAssistance Act (1960) provided massive funding to remedy the\nsituation. During the 1960\u2019s Canada and the Provinces mounted a\ntechnical and vocational training program to prepare Canadians to\nparticipate in the post war industrial expansion.  Cost were shared\nby the federal and provincial governments and resulted in an\ninitiative that was the envy of many countries.  In the mid 1960\u2019s,\nTVTA administrators joined with officials working on the issue of\nhigh unemployment and slow economic growth and pooled their efforts\nin support of a series of demonstration projects.  These projects,\ncalled Canada NewStart Corporations, were funded by the Federal\nGovernment but given a large degree of independence as to the\nclientele and focus of their research.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe\nNova Scotia NewStart Corporation was established in Yarmouth, Nova\nScotia in 1967 with Tom Jones as Director and Robert Adams as\nDirector of Occupational Training; the project focused on skill\ntraining for rural youth.  Given Adams experience in occupational and\nfunctional analyses, it was not surprising that analysis was a\ncornerstone of his research.  In Nova Scotia, Adams worked directly\nwith local employers and unemployed youth to develop relevant\ntraining for people wanting to improve their lot in life.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBC\nVersion\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEach\ntraining program was preceded by an analysis of competencies\npracticed by high performers in the occupation.  Adams convened a\ngroup of practitioners and, those who supervised them, with Adams,\nhimself, facilitating the analysis process.  The ...",

Many schools, colleges, business and industry training departments are using or have adopted competency based training techniques.\n\n\n\n\nOne approach being used to deliver competency based training is the DACUM model. This model is not new; its initial development began in the mid 60's. What is new is the move away from traditional education to competency or outcomes based education. The DACUM model is being adopted by training institutions and industrial training departments on a world wide basis.\n\n\n\n\nThe need for information on how the DACUM model works is acute. This re-presentation of the DACUM model may be timely and will provide educators and trainers with information on developing and implementing a competency based education system.\n\n\n\n\nAs one who has worked with the DACUM model at Holland College and elsewhere for 25 years, it is a privilege to recommend the reading of this booklet.\u00a0 It should assist educators and trainers in the development and delivery of competency based training and education.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLawrence Coffin\n\nEducation Consultant\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n\n\n\nThis book is about DACUM.\u00a0 It is intended to be a short description of the DACUM approach to organizing and delivering training.\u00a0 The book is based on the model developed by Nova Scotia NewStart Corporation in Yarmouth, Nova Scotia during the late 1960's. During the same time period, a different model of DACUM was developed and implemented in British Columbia; however, the approach developed by the Nova Scotia NewStart appears to be the one most widely followed.\n\n\n\n\nThe idea of writing a book or booklet about DACUM has been suggested many times.\u00a0 In this regard, the first initiative by the writer was DACUM ROOTS which traced the origins of the DACUM concept.\u00a0 A decision to write this book arises from numerous conversations and requests for information, not about the origins, but about the concept ...",

Advocates for intentional, strategic charitable giving rather than reactive responses to every solicitation. Shares personal anecdotes about different giving approaches and argues that donors should identify causes reflecting their values and capacity. Emphasizes targeting support toward projects creating systemic change rather than perpetual maintenance. This draft reveals his practical wisdom about charitable responsibility and individualized approach to community benefit.",

Another keeps all requests\n\tuntil December 1 and then makes his giving decisions.  Some do not\n\tgive to telephone canvassers.  A couple gives directly to\n\tindividuals, usually young people, who have specific needs.  Instead\n\tof giving give to someone on the street I tke them to a nearby\n\trestaurant and buy a sandwich or coffee.

Glendenning catalogs the extensive control systems schools maintain: determining students' departure times, bus behavior, lunch schedules, subject choices, room assignments, exam timing, and departure times.

The document advocates learner-centered education beginning with educational assessment, permanent educational advisors (like family doctors), and individual learning plans\u2014contrasting this with current group-based instruction assuming same-age students need identical lessons. He criticizes both bureaucratic control and the lack of individual attention in mass education.",

For a period of twelve years or more, our young people spend a large chunk of each day and each year in a school system. The system determines the time they leave home, when and where they get on a school bus, how they act while on the bus, where to get off, when they enter the school, where they park their lunch and clothes, what subjects they will study, what rooms they will be in and when, when and where they will eat lunch, which teachers they may have, the text books to be used, when and where exams will be taken, when they may leave the facility and the list goes on.\n\n\n\n\nThe system also controls what hours teachers work, where they work, what they can teach, what they are paid, when a teacher must release a student to another student, the teaching-learning model, etc., etc., etc. Not much freedom in the system.\n\n\n\n\nSchools continue to operate on an industrial organizational model; most other organizations have moved beyond that style of operation. The Minister decrees and the system executes. While the system does not literally execute its students, in some ways it demands and reinforces a kind of behaviour not in the best interests of learners and the community they will live in.\n\n\n\n\nCompare, for a moment, a Department of Health and a Department of Education, excluding the actual hospitals and schools, doctors and teachers.\n\n\n\n\nEmployees Professional Support Publications Printing budget School Units Professionals Support Budget\n\n\n\n\nI let the reader draw his or her own conclusions.\n\n\n\n\nWith that kind and level of bureaucracy, what chances does a teacher have of being innovative?

Are they for students with a terminal illness?\u00a0 Are these final in terms of individual students or final as far as the institution is concerned?\u00a0 Then I wondered, if my doctor called my next exam my final exam, what would that mean? \u00a0 Would that be even more ominous than a final exam for learning?\n\n\n\n\nA final exam for students implies, at least for me, that students are not expected to learn anything further.\u00a0 The term is at odds with the concept of life-long learning.\u00a0 The day or week after exams are finished, a student may have a significant learning experience; maybe even while taking the exam.\u00a0 The exams mentioned in my morning paper are more likely to be semester or year-end finals.\u00a0 But they could also reflect the fact that the school will no longer offer that subject ad, therefore, the school will no longer assess student performance in it.\n\n\n\n\nOne\u2019s record of learning in school plays a significant role, I believe, when seeking employment or acceptance to further study.\u00a0 So where, in the scheme of things, can a student who has had significant learning experiences outside school have that experience validated, or measured and reported?\u00a0 If we believe in lifelong learning and want to encourage it, and I think that most people do, we should make it easy for people who learn outside the school have that learning validated. \u00a0\n\n\n\n\nExaminations are, and should be, an important tool in helping people learn.\u00a0 The assessing of what has been learned for the purpose of\u00a0 obtaining a qualification, or obtaining employment, is an entirely different matter, and has no place in schools.",

He expresses confidence in reaching the $200,000 goal with extra effort but emphasizes Ken's leadership role with key players, noting Katy is \"too new to the business\" to close deals. Don proposes a detailed five-part strategy including tidying up commitments, activating volunteers, organizing letter campaigns, and researching off-island foundations. The memo demonstrates Don's strategic thinking, fundraising expertise, and collaborative leadership style.",

However, as with change in any organizational setting, resistance has been strong, and the public debate on the appropriateness of new models for school governance continues.\n                \nThis Digest explains why public-school governance is the subject of increasing scrutiny, identifies who is held accountable for results in the current governance system, and describes several recent proposals for transforming governance structures.\u00a0\n                \nWhy Are Changes in School Governance Being Recommended?\n                \nMost of the past decade\u2019s education reforms were initiated at the state or the school level, bypassing or ignoring the school board and district office.

Yet one question I am regularly asked is: why is Keele University not aligned to a mission group and never has been?\n\nWith mounting pressure on universities to lead the growth of our knowledge economy, it continues to surprise many of my contemporaries that being part of a mission group is a move Keele regularly considers, but has not yet been persuaded to undertake.\n\nThe simplest answer is that none of the existing mission groups provide a natural fit for Keele, a university founded on a principle to break away from established patterns. Keele is not unique in this respect, as a significant number of universities choose to be non-aligned, a fact frequently overlooked in the media and political engagement with the sector.\n\nIn an article for the Guardian earlier this year, Peter Scott surmised that universities are always going to be \"more different and individual\" than the identity they share with their mission group, and this is one of my main concerns with group alignment.\n\nYes, mission groups aim to highlight diversity in the sector, encourage collaboration and stimulate debate \u2013 the Russell Group provides the prevailing example of how a group can rally strength in numbers to create a powerful voice to stimulate change. Yet for me, being aligned brings with it greater risks of marginalising a university's own interests for the benefit of the wider group, which cannot be ignored.\n\nFirstly, the very nature of group politics means that each group has clearly defined parameters, usually ...",

However, the association also believes that their demise creates an opportunity as well as a challenge.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0The NAHT Commission into Assessment without Levels chaired by Lord Sutherland of Houndwood (a former chief inspector of schools) brought together head teachers, academics and representatives from relevant agencies including the schools\u2019 inspectorate, Ofsted, the Department for Education, and the exam regulator, Ofqual.\n\n\u00a0The commission and its panel sat several times in autumn last year (2013). Its remit was to:\n\n  \nEstablish a key set of principles for good assessment;\u00a0\n  \nFind examples of current best practice that met these principles;\u00a0\n  \nSecure confidence in these principles in those who hold schools to account.\u00a0\n\n\nKey recommendations announced by Lord Sutherland today included:\u00a0\n\n  \nSchools should adopt a consistent approach to assessment across the country. The commission also produced a 'design checklist' to underpin this;\u00a0\n\n\n  \nSchools should retain the use of levels while designing a new system;\u00a0\n\n\n  \nPupils should be judged against objective criteria rather than ranked against each other;\u00a0\n\n\n  \nAll assessments need external moderation and that this moderation needs real teeth;\u00a0\n\n\n  \nAssessment should be driven from the curriculum.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nA full summary of recommendations is include...",

  "summary": "Glendenning critiques schools' time-based structure and advocates making graduation the objective while time becomes the variable. He notes schools measure achievement by how much students learn in fixed time, like measuring how far runners go in set time rather than how long they take to complete a course. Since learning rates vary individually and most students can master content with adequate time, extending the school year for struggling students would increase graduation rates. The proposal is modest\u2014extra weeks for non-proficient students\u2014but reflects his fundamental belief that time shouldn't constrain capability. The document demonstrates Don's capacity to identify simple, high-leverage systemic changes.",
  "content_preview": "INCREASING GRADUATION RATES\n\n\n\n\nSchools are time based institutions.\u00a0 The system sets the number of days schools are open, the number of hours of instruction each day, days to be made up because of storms, the length of time available on a subject before you must move to another, they keep attendance, time missed may result in the lowering of a grade, teacher pay scales are related to years of training and years of experience.\u00a0 I can think of no other sector that is so driven by time.\n\n\n\n\nThe curriculum carves up subjects to be learned into subjects, units and lessons. \u00a0\n\n\n\n\nRate of learning, on the other hand, is unique to each individual.\u00a0 It is generally understood that most students can learn most subjects to the same level if given time. \u00a0\n\n\n\n\nLearners enter school and are told, here is what is to be learned and here are the dates and times that teachers are available to help you learn.\u00a0 And as you know, you are measured on ho much you learn in the time available.\n\n\n\n\nIt is a bit like conducting a race and, instead of measuring the time it takes each to run the course, it measures how far you can run in a set time.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nration the amount of teacher time available to students.\u00a0 We organize schools around content to be learned and time available for instruction\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe encourage students to stay in school and to graduate, and we should continue to do so.\u00a0 Many more could graduate if they had a bit more time and help.\u00a0 If this is so, why not give students the few extra days needed?\u00a0 I am not suggesting that the school year be extended for all.\u00a0 Students meeting graduation requirement should not have to stay longer; students not meeting graduation requirements should be allowed and encouraged to stay.\u00a0 Let\u2019s make graduation the objective and time the variable.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nOne might be surprised on the impact of an extra couple of weeks of study on school graduation requirements.",

He reiterates that education\u2014preparation for life roles\u2014differs fundamentally from schooling and requires comprehensive service delivery (policy, governance, instruction, resources, information, counseling, quality assurance). Key issues include: inadequate public statements of educational purpose and principles; limited Department mandate focused narrowly on curriculum delivery rather than broad educational leadership; absence of comprehensive vision statements; underserved information functions; conflicting quality assurance approaches; and disconnection from communities served. Don advocates for independent certification bodies (as in apprenticeships) to separate teaching from grading, allowing teachers to focus on learning without compromising their role.

He addresses five major issues: Focus on Knowledge (learner-centered versus subject-centered instruction), Professional Freedom (autonomy and accountability), Delivery Model (administrative versus educational functions), Assessment and Standards (independence from teaching), and Credentials and Qualifications. The paper advocates for learner-centered approaches, teacher autonomy in instructional decisions, separation of coaching from referee functions (grading/ranking), outcome-based education, and independent assessment bodies.

The\n\tPEI education literature refers to helping people find \u201ca place\u201d\n\tin society; we need to better define that \u201cplace\u201d.  Life roles\n\thave been described as that of an individual, citizen, a producer, a\n\tconsumer, family member and student. All roles can benefit from\n\teducation but all may not need the  same mix or time. \n\t\n\t\n\nTerminology\n\tnot posted \u2013 The\n\tconcept of \u201ceducation and \u201cschool\u201d are used interchangeably;\n\tthe World Bank cautions countries about this practice.\n\t\n\nFunctions/services\n\tnot\n\tidentified -\n\tEducation is a\n\tservice. Typical education services include: information,\n\tcounselling, instruction, products and technology, quality\n\tassurance. governance, funding and human resources.

Front line service providers (teachers) need both\n\texpertise and autonomy to respond to learner needs.\n\tThe OECD tells us\n\tthat PISA results are better for students in schools with autonomy\n\tfor their day-to-day operation; the World Bank advises Ministries of\n\tEducation to delegate downward.\n\t\n\nAccountabilities\n\tnot clear  -\n\tMathew Bedard of the Montreal Economic Institute points out that\n\t\u201cautonomy and ...",

Analysis\n\nAs noted earlier, the Agency was asked to examine the issue of allergies to peanuts, nuts and sesame seeds for commercial air passengers in respect of domestic and international flights using aircraft with 30 or more passenger seats operated by Canadian air carriers and by foreign air carriers operating flights in and out of Canada, by looking into these two matters:\n\n  \nThe risk of anaphylaxis due to adverse contact with and/or ingestion of these allergens while on board the aircraft; and\n  \nThe effectiveness of current risk-mitigation measures, as outlined in the Allergy Decision.\n\n\nThe research and evidence outlined in the previous sections of this report lead us to the answers to these two questions.\n\n1. The risk of anaphylaxis due to adverse contact with and/or ingestion of these allergens while on board the aircraft\n\nIt is clear from both expert reports that the mostly likely route of exposure causing an allergic reaction that could lead to anaphylaxis onboard an aircraft is via accidental ingestion. Information presented in both the NRC Report and Dr. Greenhawt\u2019s Report indicates that it is unlikely that peanut, nut, and sesame seed-based allergens can aerosolize and cause inhalation-based reactions. Dr. Greenhawt's Report notes while exposure via inhalation is commonly believed to be a route of exposure, there is no data to support this. Rather, data that does exist consistently shows that peanut allergens to not aerosolize; moreover, Dr. Greenhawt notes that there have been no oral or inhalation provocation studies to support the theory that nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal mucosal exposure can trigger an allergic reaction. It is possible, as the NRC report indicates, that allergic reactions attributed to inhalation\u00a0 are being incorrectly attributed to unnoticed ingestion or dermal contact of allergens that have settled on surfaces..\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to the unlikelihood of an inhalation-based reaction, almost all large domestic air carriers oper...",

  "summary": "This document is a blog post discussing the nature of learning and personal development. It emphasizes that learning is fundamentally a process of discovery, critique of traditional classroom lecture-based learning as inefficient, and the importance of curiosity as essential to effective learning. The author argues that learners need freedom to ask questions, time for reflection and exploration, sufficient leisure to think, open-mindedness to the unexpected, and a stress-free environment. References to two blogs: \"Slow Leadership\" and \"The Coyote Within.\" The piece advocates for creating conditions where exploration and self-directed learning can flourish, particularly relevant for adult self-development and professional growth.",

It\u2019s easy to become downhearted at the way the world seems. How the media constantly complain about schools and other educational institutions, as if spending on education were a waste of resources. If more reporters paid attention to blogs, they\u2019d see just how much enthusiasm there is for all aspects of learning.\n\nWe all know learning is a process of discovery. Sitting in a classroom listening to a lecture is probably the most inefficient way for anyone to learn. I think that\u2019s why some people leave the educational system with little or no sign of achievement, only to more than make up for that lack once they have the opportunity to pursue their own brand of self-development. I\u2019m also sure most teachers don\u2019t want to try to work in this way. It\u2019s the pressure and lack of resources that force them into it \u2014 plus the crazy emphasis politicians have placed on standardized tests.\u00a0\n\nWhen it comes to learning for yourself, the best friend you have is curiosity. Strong learners are always asking questions. They don\u2019t accept glib or conventional answers. Nor do they assume others, even those in authority or people with a long string of credentials, automatically know better than they do. Experts are a great resource, but need to be used with care. Some of them got their degrees more by knowing how to work the system than by intellectual merit.\n\nIf you want learning to work for you, you must create the conditions in which exploration can take place and discoveries can be made. It\u2019s very clear what these are:\n\nregular time to reflect\n\nenough leisure to think and explore\n\nfreedom to ask que...",

Begins with 2013 CFPEI youth survey findings regarding preparedness gaps, followed by Education 20/20's multi-year exploration of \"basic skills.\" Document articulates major concerns: undefined content/levels, economic drag from low skill levels, duplication of remedial teaching, scattered institutional responsibility, and low priority given to basic skills instruction. Proposes using the 1978 \"Practical Mathematics\" analysis as a foundation and DACUM methodology (developed by Nova Scotia NewStart, pioneered by Holland College) for creating a shared competency framework. Outlines next steps: establish steering committee, review existing analysis, develop rating scales, identify profiles, and develop assessment processes.",

Bright\nspots include a positive sense of community, emerging entrepreneurial\nspirit, volunteerism and new postsecondary offerings. The main\nconcerns include a lack of jobs, surviving on low-paying jobs,\neducational deficiencies and drug and alcohol addictions.  On the\nsubject of education and learning, the study reports a high rate of\ncompletion of high school and postsecondary education, a high level\nof inclusivity and relatively affordable tuition costs; young people\nalso  expressed concerns about their readiness for the next stage of\nlife including: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cpreparedness gaps with regard to\nreadiness for\n\n\npostsecondary study and the workplace\u201d \u2013\nVital Signs, CFPEI, 2013\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollowing the publication of the\nCFPEI Report, Education 20/20 organized six public discussions for\nthe purpose of informing the community of the report and its\nfindings, learning more about youth issues in our communities,\nexploring issues of education and learning, and to identify actions\nto be taken to close gaps.

This approach to math is called\nnumeracy and it involves the application of math to every-day lives.\nNumeracy is being adopted elsewhere; usually in addition to\ntraditional math.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut we need more, to begin\nwith we need an analysis of math skills used by Islanders. Making an\nanalysis involves bringing together a small group for a two- day of\nbrainstorming session.   It\u2019s a proven technique, we used it\nregularly at Holland College but apparently there is no one on PEI\nnow with the expertise.  The cost of undertaking the analyses is\n$15,000.  \n\n\n     \n\n\nI\nam approaching a few people who might contribute $1-2,000 each to\nhelp cover the cost.

  "summary": "This document contains 58 instructional maxims written by Bronson Alcott (transcendentalist educator) in 1826-1827 to guide teaching practice. The maxims emphasize teaching as a moral and ethical calling (\"with a sense of accountableness to the profession,\" \"as an agent of the Great Instructor\"), character formation, preparation of materials, respect for individual learning differences, inductive methods, and student-centered approaches. Key themes include: teaching through discovery and curiosity, learning from multiple sensory modalities, adapting to individual student needs, using encouragement rather than coercion, connecting learning to practical life applications, and fostering independent thinking. The maxims represent 19th-century progressive educational philosophy emphasizing pedagogy that respects students' dignity, intellectual capacity, and individual learning styles.",

  "content_preview": "February 19, 2014\n\nPreparedness on the hotseat\n\nThe lack of basic skills, literacy, numeracy and citizenship, were the lead issue raised by participants in a workshop in Montague on Tuesday evening; the relevance of schooling to real life was a second.\n\nThe workshop, organized by Education 20/20 first heard a presentation on the findings of a recent survey of over 200 Island youth between the ages of 15 and 25.\u00a0 The survey, Taking the Pulse of Island Youth, dealt with youth concerns about health, education, employment and social well-being.\u00a0 The presentation, led by Steve McQuaid, VP of the Community Foundation of Prince Edward Island and Katherine MacDonald, Researcher, provided details about the methodology and findings. \u00a0\n\nAmong the other discussion points was the view that some of the desired changes are structural and not educational, a question as to whether or not it is the role of a school to teach life skills, the declining value of school diplomas, and the difficulty of developing a culture of learning. Since schools are entirely funded and more or less operated by Government, improvement initiatives often reflect short term political considerations over sound principles of public policy\u201d.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0Similar workshops are planned for other Island communities in the coming weeks.\u00a0 People interested in future activities of Education 20/20, or to be placed on the mailing list for the monthly newsletter, should check the website, www.education2020.ca\n\n  \n 30\u00a0 \u00a0 -\n\n\nContact: \tDon Glendenning\n\n\t\t892-5859",

They are located at 161 St. Peters road, the old Ellis Brothers Shopping Centre. (Tel: 902-368-3620).\u00a0 They may have some ideas and be able to put you in touch with a volunteer tutor.\n\n\n\n\nI commend you for your interest in your grandson\u2019s school studies.\u00a0 Our education system would benefit if more people like yourself took an active interest in what schools do.\n\n\n\n\nAgain, thanks for your letter.\u00a0 I only wish that I could be more helpful.\u00a0 Let me know how you make out.\n\n\n\n\nRegards\n\n\n\n\nDon Glendenning",

The first defines the category that is being evaluated, and\nthe other four show levels 1 through 4. Level 1 is 50%-60%, Level 2\nis 60%-70%, Level 3 is 70%-80%, and Level 4 is 80%-100%. Some\nteachers represent a perfect mark by suffixing a plus\nsign to the 4 (\"Level\n4+\"). The Ontario rubric system is used more or less throughout\nhigh\nschools and elementary\nschools in Ontario.\n\n\nThe rows are typically broken into four strands:\n\n\t\n\n\n\tKnowledge/Understanding \n\t\n\t\n\n\n\tThinking/Inquiry \n\t\n\t\n\n\n\tApplication \n\t\n\t\n\n\n\tCommunication \n\t\n\n\n\nThey can also be organized into sections for projects like this:\n\n\t\n\n\n\tAppearance/ Neatness \n\t\n\t\n\n\n\tOrganization \n\t\n\t\n\n\n\tInformation and Understanding \n\t\n\t\n\n\n\tGeneral Appeal \n\t\n\n\n\nRubrics are usually only used if the school uses\nthese four strands for marking, as they can otherwise cause\nunnecessary confusion. Rubrics provide a good breakdown of these four\nstrands, but the strands are not weighted evenly. While a student may\nhave received a low mark in only one of the rows, this can lead to a\ndramatic decrease in their overall grade if that strand is weighted\nheavier than the others. Similarly, if one receives a low mark in a\nstrand that is not weighed heavily, it can have little effect on\ntheir mark. Rubrics are also often used for relatively hard-to-mark\nitems such as CASI\ntests, and oral presentations.\n\n\nThe Ontario Rubric appears to be evolving into something known as a\n\"competency profile\".

Its main purpose so \nwas to save costs on administration. \n\n\ufffd \nThe Manitoba FRAME report provides a yearly accounting of school division spending. If larger school divisions are more efficient \nthan smaller divisions, the difference would be expected to show up in the FRAME data. \n\n\ufffd \nTiny school divisions (under 1000 students) do have higher per pupil expenditure rates and administration costs. However, the \nvast majority of divisions (those with more than 1000 students) show very little relationship between size and rates of spending. \n\n\ufffd \nThe largest school division in the province, Winnipeg School Division #1, has very high per pupil costs while much smaller divisions \nwithin the city have much lower per pupil costs. \n\n\ufffd \nSome mid-sized school divisions like Hanover and Garden Valley have very low per-pupil expenditures and administrative costs. \nEmulating examples like these makes more sense than simply creating larger divisions. \n\n\ufffd \nThe school board model itself, with its diffuse funding sources , lies at the heart of the problem. It is time to think about a more \ntransparent and accountable model. \n\nIntroduction \n\nThe Manitoba government recently reduced the total number of school divisions from 54 to 37.

Sound educational planning demands it.\u00a0 Clear, unambiguous and measurable outcomes are the place to start. \u00a0\n\n\n\n\nMy experience was with competency based education; you can imagine my delight listened to William Spady.\u00a0 We were talking the same language.\u00a0 Granted competencies were more specific but I feel that the detail is needed. A tighter specification is needed to properly plan activities and interventions, hence my preference for the term competency.\u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA competency is a statement of observable behaviour resulting from the application of knowledge to the solution of a problem or situation.\u00a0 It follows then that competency based education is an approach to organizing educational programs and activities that clearly identifies what is to be learned and various levels of achievement.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nI browsed the internet recently to update myself on outcomes based education.\u00a0 Imagine my disappointment to learn that, although many still confess to be using an OBE model, in fact the emphasis has switched to curriculum based objectives. \u00a0\n\n\n\n\nMy later browsing of the objectives as found in the PEI curriculum outlines confirms the general trend.\u00a0 Atlantic Provinces Learning outcomes are, in my view, nneither competencies of educational outcomes.\u00a0 They are, as the literature said, curriculum outcomes.\n\n\n\n\nIn issue No. 1, I mentioned the six Oregon Life Roles: individual, learner, producer, consumer, family member and citizen.\u00a0 It is my view that program planners and curriculum developers should, therefore, look to those sources to identify in some detail the nature, range and depth of skills ex...",

In recognition of its\n\timportance, governments provide support for public education. The\n\tinvestment is justified for two reasons, one to ensure a high level\n\tof personal growth and development for every citizen; the other is\n\tto ensure the common good. \n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\nBased\n\ton recent media reports, one can conclude that there are gaps\n\tbetween what Islanders have and what they want in the way of\n\teducation.

He catalogs problems: compensation based on university credentials rather than performance; dependence on outside experts; inadequate information in reporting systems; selective PISA result citation without implementing recommendations; reluctance to speak publicly about education; lack of conceptual clarity; frequent administrative turnover with government changes; political appointment of leadership; minimal educational research; and emphasis on delivery rather than development.

Bonner argues that higher education is more cost than it's\nworth in its current state.\n\n\nWhen\nthe financial crisis of 2008 hit, we saw how state-managed capitalism\nworks. Favored companies are allowed to make as much money as they\ncan. But they are protected from going broke.\n\n\nCertain\nfirms are deemed \u201ctoo big to fail,\u201d by virtue of the key role\nthey play in the economy, or at least by the role they play in a\npolitician\u2019s plans for re-election or future employment. But\nstate-managed capitalism is very different from the real thing. It is\ncapitalism in a degenerate form.\n\n\nReal\ncapitalism progresses in fits and starts, described by Josef\nSchumpeter as \u201ccreative destruction.\u201d It is like a jungle\u2026not\nlike a zoo. It cannot be managed. You cannot take out the predators\nor feed selected species without upsetting the balance of nature.\nTake out the destruction, and you block the creative process too.\n\n\nSince\nthe beginning of the Industrial Revolution, most real wealth has come\nfrom real capitalism. Not from \u201cplaying the market.\u201d Not from\ngetting a good job. Not by trying to cadge favors from the\ngovernment.\n\n\nSo,\nwhat is real capitalism? It is what we\u2019ve seen in the\ncomputer/Internet industry over the last 20 years. This was a new\nindustry. It had not yet been tamed by the government. Regulations\nwere few. There were no large, entrenched companies to block\nstart-ups. There were no lobbyists to curry favor from the\npoliticians. There were no subsidies\u2026and no barriers. It was young,\ndynamic, chaotic\u2026and very prone to blow-ups.\n\n\nThe\nwhol...",

Early results show limited uptake: Broward College offered low-cost degrees in only four specialized programs with 80-student target, while Miami Dade drew 62 students.

Governor Perry said he hoped 10 percent of the state\u2019s degrees would meet that goal with online learning and new efficiencies. Governor Scott sought low-cost degrees in high-demand fields.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nDemocrats were critical of both announcements, calling the idea a gimmick that would lead to a watered down \u201cWalmartization\u201d of higher education. Meanwhile, in California, a Republican legislator has called for a pilot program there.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nNow the $10,000 degrees are available in Florida and Texas \u2014 but not for many students, not for many majors and not on the flagship campuses. The original goal was that the degrees would use new teaching techniques and technologies to bring down costs; so far, many of the programs are unchanged.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nIn Florida, the two dozen former community colleges that offer both associate and baccalaureate degrees all volunteered to meet the $10,000 challenge, but several programs are not yet under way.

  "content_preview": "Re-engineering Education\n\n\n\n\nOur education system is quite outdated; it emphasizes schooling rather than education, is inflexible,\n\naccountability is scattered, there is too much emphasis on time spent in a class or on a subject,\n\nallows little choice by learners and lacks clear and consistent standards.\n\n\n\n\nTinkering with the system won't do. We need to do more than strike a new committee, undertake a\n\nnew public survey, add or change courses, increase teacher pay, revise the curriculum, add more\n\nprofessional development days or purchase a few new computers. The system could profit from\n\nsome re-engineering. But where do we start? The following structural changes would be high on\n\nmy list.\n\n\n\n\nProvide each student with an \"education advisor\", a person with a role similar to that of a family\n\ndoctor, with whom the learner or parent could consult at any time on matters pertaining to the\n\neducation of their child. Most of us would not be very happy if we had a new family doctor each\n\nyear, especially if the new doctor was not of our choosing. An education advisor would, for the\n\nmost part, provide advice and direction during at least K through 12, however, it could be longer if\n\nneeded. Students could elect to change advisors but advisors would have no choice in selecting\n\nstudents; advisors could refuse to take a student only if they were not accepting additional students.\n\nThe educational advisor would provide an access point to the education system, provide continuity\n\nfor each learner; the advisor would work closely with each learner providing advice, instruction and\n\nreferral to specialist teachers as needed. Student transcripts would be signed off by the educational\n\nadvisor.\n\n\n\n\nOur current system of awarding degrees, diplomas and certificates interferes with getting an\n\neducation. Teaching and certifying are very different functions; they serve different purposes.\n\nPursuing an education is more than, perhaps even entirely different from, pursuing a diploma or...",

Based on the National Standards for Family-School Partnerships of the Parent teachers Association in the USA:\n\n\n\n\nThe awards recognize schools\u00a0 that have implemented the organization\u2019s national standards for family-school partnerships.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStandard 1: \tWelcoming all families into the school community\u2014Families are active participants in the life of the school, and feel welcomed, valued, and connected to each other, to school staff, and to what students are learning and doing in class.\n\nStandard 2: \tCommunicating effectively\u2014Families and school staff engage in regular, two-way, meaningful communication about student learning.\n\nStandard 3: \tSupporting student success\u2014Families and school staff continuously collaborate to support students\u2019 learning and healthy development both at home and at school, and have regular opportunities to strengthen their knowledge and skills to do so effectively.\n\nStandard 4: \tSpeaking up for every child\u2014Families are empowered to be advocates for their own and other children, to ensure that students are treated fairly and have access to learning opportunities that wi...",

Based on our activities to date, we\u00a0 believes that there are many Islanders living (or have lived) in communities all across the Island who have the capacity and are interested in leaving\u00a0 a legacy to their community to support a worthy cause or service. However, there is often not a broad-based 'community-owned' method or vehicle available to them to achieve their desire to do this. While it is acknowledged that there are opportunities to make donations or leave legacies to things like the regional hospital, these institutions are not really community-owned anymore as they are managed and funded by the government for the most part. \u00a0 and the remaining local charitable organizations do not have or are not perceived to have\u00a0 the capacity to handle endowments in perpetuity.\n\n\n\n\nOver the past year, the Foundation has begun to develop a new approach to assisting Island communities through a fund called the Community Fund. The Community Fund is intended to provide a formal mechanism for Islanders to contribute to the well being of their community through a financial donation or a legacy fund. Having such a fund allows the community to support local services and initiatives (e.g. the high school band, local artists, health support services, etc).\n\n\n\n\nOur Foundation has already helped the Eastern Kings area set up such a fund, and has begun similar discussions with interested parties in both the Charlottetown and Summerside areas. The Foundation has a vision of establishing a Community Fund in all areas across the Island.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n(insert a brief description of how the Eastern Kings/Souris Fund works - how it has already helped certain local causes - perhaps attach the Eastern Kings Fund 'handout' as part of appendix)\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nNote: For purposes of this proposal, a ...",

Donald Savoie argues that politiciens and public servants are good at generating and avoiding blame, playing to a segment of the population to win the next election, embracing and defending the status quo, adding management layers and staff, keeping ministers out of trouble, responding to demands from the prime minister and his office, send managing a complex, prime ministered-centered organization.\u00a0 Conversely, they are not as good at defining the broader public interest, providing and recognizing evidence-based policy advice, managing human\u00a0 and financial resources with efficiency and frugality, innovating and reforming itself, being accountable to Parliament and to citizens, dealing with non-performers, paying sufficient attention to service delivery, and implementing and evaluating the impact of policies and programs.\n\n\n\n\nWith wide implications for representative democracy, What is government good at? Is a persuasive analysis of an approach to government that has opened the door to those with resources to influence policy and decision- making while leaving average citizens outside looking in.\u201d",

Drawing on his federal labor department experience, Don notes that standards discussions historically focused on training inputs rather than performance outputs. He argues existing standards emphasize range of tasks but neglect performance levels, illustrated by the difference between apprentice and journeyperson performance on the same skill. Don advocates for identifying broad performance criteria (quality, speed, supervision required) and establishing employment-based levels that are recognized by practitioners, clearly stated, readily understood, and easily applied. He contends the challenge remains unmet of creating standards that balance comprehensiveness with practical applicability.",

I know because I was at a number of the meetings.\n\n\n\n\nSome of the initiatives intended to deal with the issue of training standards included:\n\n\n\n\npreparation of occupational analyses;\n\npreparation of functional analyses of entire industries;\n\nagreement on program content;\n\ntraining for technical and vocational teachers;\n\nagreement on criteria for awarding diplomas and certificates;\n\ncommon program entrance requirements; and regular meet among program managers institution directors.\n\n\n\n\nMost of the above initiatives were related to training input; not much attention was ven at the national level to output standards. Some of these initiatives are still around but others have fallen by the wayside.\n\n\n\n\nIn recent months, I have had an opportunity to revisit the issue of standards; much of the old debate exists even to the issue of provincial jurisdiction. But much has also happened with HRDC and Sectoral Councils leading the charge. I am eased to report, furthermore, that the emphasis has switched from input measures to output or fo!rnlaIloe based measures. A sl fi development, indeed. But more needs to be done. A major component of standards setting remains relatively untouched\n\n\n\n\nI base my conclusions on considerable of the the year or more including a fairly extensive literature, involvement in a number of surveys and ring activities, considerable discussion with much reflection.\n\n\n\n\nect during revi.ew of information colleagues and\n\n\n\n\nThe remainder of my comments deal with occupational standards.\n\nare different from but related to training standards.

Take any community, Souris, Belfast or Wellington, for example, and it appears that the Premier is the only person with a responsibility to see that people in those communities receive the education services they need. Obviously, schools are there for young people but help for other community members is uncertain.\n\n\n\n\nIt would be easy to designate a local school, likely a high school, as a full-service education centre and appoint the principal as Director of Educational services.\u00a0 Give a Director a bit of autonomy and accountability and, in one simple move, we provide a community with a person to work on their behalf.\u00a0 While I have not researched the idea, a form of community based education centres appears to be in operation in Quebec, maybe in other Provinces, and certainly in the USA.\n\n\n\n\nI\u2019ve had a number of discussions about education with folks in the Souris area recently; when doing so, I ask where people get the information they need to make sound educational decisions.

He connects his childhood experience of \"sitting by Nellie\" (a historical term from English cotton mills for learning through observation) with contemporary work-placement programs. While acknowledging the limitation of absorption-based learning lacking pedagogical intentionality, he expresses gratitude for those who mentored him and reflects on how work placements attempt to capture experiential learning's benefits. This piece provides crucial biographical context about Don's formative years.",

Sitting by Nellie is not a Miramichi term; it actually arises from the days of child labour in the cotton mills in England where one learned by watching \u201cNellie\u201d as she tended her loom.\u00a0 The good part of the experience was the absorption of the plant culture; the downside was that Nellie often lacked the competencies that plant owners hoped would be emulated.\n\nToday\u2019s work placements for students, I suggest, are an attempt to capture some of the advantages gained from sitting by Nellie.\u00a0 Too short mostly to absorb the employment culture, they do inject some reality into a student\u2019s educational experience. \u00a0\n\nMy thanks to all the \u201cNellies\u201d who helped me in my education career.",

  "summary": "Don examines the credentialing system in Canada and who should award credentials. He questions whether displayed diplomas and degrees actually indicate competence to serve, noting his experience as an employer revealed transcripts more useful than degrees. Don critiques how institutions award credentials after completing pre-set programs based on criteria that may not reflect occupational standards, limiting student choice and resulting in graduates following similar instruction regardless of individual interests. He contrasts academic credentials with more specific certificates and calls for reconsidering what credentials are needed, who should award them, and on what basis. Don emphasizes that teachers teach while schools sort learners, and this sorting function profoundly impacts future life choices.

  "summary": "Don Glendenning's professional writing on competency-based rating scales for vocational education. Explains the DACUM model and Holland College's adoption of a 0-4 rating system, with 4 subdivided into 4A, 4B, 4C levels. Demonstrates his innovative thinking in educational assessment and his leadership in establishing industry-standard benchmarks for performance evaluation across Atlantic Canada.",
  "content_preview": "The Rating Scale\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe\ngave considerable thought to a rating scale and, again, examined\ntraditional marking schemes as well as innovative ones found in our\nsearch.  We settled on the one developed by Adams as part of the\nDACUM model as described earlier.  It is only in hindsight that I\nrealize the significance of that decision.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe DACUM reflects the way we describe a person\u2019s performance;\nthe DACUM rating scale weaves together a set of performance\nstatements based on such criteria as quality of work, quantity of\nwork, initiative, adaptability, amount of supervision and assistance.\n The scale was linear.   At the bottom was a \u201c0\u201d rating for a\nperson who did not have sufficient skill to function in the\nworkplace; the top rating was a \u201c6\u201d for a person who was able to\nlead others in practising the skill.  It certainly is the most\nrealistic performance rating scale that I\u2019ve encountered\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs we began to use the scale, however, we concluded that a\ncompletely linear scale did not reflect our understanding of\nperformance in the workplace; initial ratings are linear but higher\nlevel ratings are not.  The college adopted levels \u201c0\u201d to \u201c4\u201d\nas defined by Adams but  replaced levels \u201c4 to 6\u201d with a \u201c4A,\n4B  and 4C.  Under this format, a learner could obtain any or all of\nthe 4 levels.  Later, in an attempt to establish common performance\nbased rating system for Atlantic Canada, the \u201c0\u201d was dropped as\nwell.  I am not sure, in hindsight, that we should have done this.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first three levels are linear, that is the person progresses\nfrom level 1 through 2 to 3.  Performance at the 4 level is not\nlinear, that is a person may obtain a level 4a, 4b or 4c or any\ncombination thereof.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith any rating scale, a benchmark is necessary and the benchmark\nshould reflect the field in which the rating is practiced.  For a\nplumber, for example, a rating of three would represent a plumber who\nc...",

  "summary": "(179 words):** Don addresses vocational secondary education's decline, identifying both obvious factors (facility costs, image, program obsolescence) and deeper issues: academic-general education conflation inflating academic credit requirements. However, he notes research reveals no course-configuration superiority for further education or employment. While acknowledging high-technology economy needs educated workers, Don questions whether additional academic courses provide claimed breadth. He cites Senate report supporting core competencies: reading, writing, math, computer science, societal knowledge, learning-to-learn, teamwork, adaptability, information synthesis. Critically, Don argues these skills aren't content-driven but approach-dependent. Vocational welding courses often better develop core competencies than traditional history classrooms: real projects, responsibility assumption, authentic work habits, freedom of movement\u2014practices schools often discourage. Don proposes secondary programs group subjects under clusters (science, social studies, communications, business, technology), allowing individual courses to serve general or vocational purposes depending on instructor approach and learner intent. He advocates eliminating academic-vocational distinctions, allowing student choice to guide educational decisions.",
  "content_preview": "42 Secondary Education:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIs there a place for Vocational Courses?\n\n\n\n\nvocational education in secondary schools is at a crossroads.\n\nSome of the reasons are obvious: cost of facilities, lower student teacher ratio, image, programs becoming out of date, failure to develop programs in emerging occupations, delay by students in making career choices, and the list goes on.\n\n\n\n\nBut there is a more major reason for the decline and that is the view that general education and academic education are one and the same. The result of this view, widely held by those who make speeches and make or influence decisions, is an increase in the number of academic credits required for High School graduation. Understandable and commendable, but is it based on fact? Our reading railed to reveal one pattern of courses at the secondary school level to be better than another as preparation for further education or for life (Perhaps our readers can enlighten us).\n\n\n\n\nThe argument goes something like this. We are moving into an era of high technology, information as a resource, rapid change, and the global economy. A better educated work force is a key component. Better educated means more years of schooling - a minimum of high school graduation and preferable some postsecondary education.\n\n\n\n\nEducation must also be more transferable so that one can adjust to changing times. Vocational courses are too narrow and limiting. Additional academic courses are the answer so that the worker will have a broader base and have more options open to him/her.\n\n\n\n\nIn support of the need for more transferable or generic education, one reads on page 3 of the recent Senate report entitled, In Training, Only Work Works:\n\n\n\n\n\"To transform information into knowledge in our information society, our people need basic, core skills: the ability to read, write and understand complex material; to comunicate in one's mother tongue; to know a certain level of mathematics and computer science; to know how society and...",

Articulates his philosophy that education shapes individual lives and community development. Distinguishes education broadly from schooling specifically, drawing on World Bank research cautioning against conflating school attendance with education.

Demonstrates Don's conviction that education systems should be understood comprehensively and that current definitions narrowly focus on curriculum delivery.",
  "content_preview": "About\n\nEducation\n\n\n\n\nWhy?\n\nWelcome to About Education!\n\n\n\n\nNo doubt you are wondering why I\u2019m writing this newsletter; the answer is simple. I\u00a0 believe education to be important. It was important to me; I believe it is important to other readers and to the community at large. What we are allowed to do and what we are encouraged to\u00a0 learn as pat of our education, is and will continue to be influenced to a significant degree by the nature and extent of our individual and collective education.\u00a0\n\nI\u2019ve spent my life in formal education, first as a student, later\u00a0 as a teacher and always as an independent learner.\u00a0 Education has much to offer; it has been good to me and good for me. But I think the view as to what constitutes education has narrowed.\u00a0 So, what is education anyway? There are a number of ways to respond; here are three:\n\n\u2022\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 A person\u2019s education consists of experiences that have had a measurable effect on the way a person thinks, feels and acts.\n\n\u2022\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 A person\u2019s level of education reflects the extent to which they are able to cope with circumstances that confront them in their daily lives\u00a0\n\n\u2022\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 A good education, presumably, is one that prepares one to cope and thrive at a reasonable level in ones various life roles.\n\n\u2022\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 An education system is a system of services put in place by a community to support the education of its citizens. \u00a0\n\n\n\n\nAnother reason for writing is the belief that the meaning of education is not well understood. Te World Bank, for example, cautioned\u00a0 member countries about confusing education with going to\u00a0 school. (World Bank, Report on Education 2019). The PEI Department of Education seems to have fallen into the same trap when it continues to refer to its role as serving young people through \u201cdeveloping and delivering\u00a0 programs and curriculum\u201d. Our experiences in school are important but in no wy should we consider successful shool studies as the measure of our education.\n\n\n\n\n4-15-1Newsletter",

He describes CRSP as providing personalized, competency-based, and computer-assisted learning within flexible structures. NZQA's framework demonstrates how to recognize learning through multiple pathways while maintaining consistent standards. Don advocates for adopting these models despite barriers like terminology confusion and educators' preference for current systems, as they represent significant advances in learner-centered, performance-based education.",
  "content_preview": "DACUM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tDACUM has come a long way since the first analysis was undertaken in Ottawa in January of 1968.\u00a0 For people not familiar with the term, DACUM is an acronym for Design A Curriculum and is a widely accepted approach to identifying competencies being practiced or to be learned \u2013 and it is no longer limited to an analysis of traditional occupations. And it is a Canadian idea at that.\n\n\u00a0\n\nDACUM is most widely used\u00a0 as a rigorous, relevant, inexpensive and internally consistent approach\u00a0 to identifying competencies in a field or occupation.\u00a0 A major strength is the reliance on practitioners as the major source of information and a presentation of the competencies of a field on a single sheet..\u00a0 As a result, DACUM escapes the semantics of the academic.\u00a0 It is life based rather than research based and, therefore, is readily understood by people in the field since it reflects what they do and is stated in a language that the field understands.\n\n\n\n\nThe performance-based rating scale proposed by Adams is unique.\u00a0 It includes all the required elements of a good rating scale \u2500 competencies, performance criteria, a scale, and benchmarks.\u00a0 While it does not have rubrics or exemplars, they can easily be prepared.\u00a0 On the other hand, it has benchmarks (industry-based ones) which are missing in most other assessment systems I\u2019ve seen.\u00a0 In my reading and discussion, I have not found an assessment system as complete.\n\n\n\n\nA DACUM analysis is a tremendous tool for identifying and planning learning resources.\u00a0 For each competency, one can identify the kind of human resource expertise required; facilities, equipment and supplies; appropriate learning activities; assessment techniques and strategies; and the best location for learning whether it be a classroom, laboratory, shop or actually in a real work situation. \u00a0\n\n\n\n\nThe model provides recognition for prior learning, self assessment, instructor confirmatiob of achievements,\u00a0 a tool for career planning, a basis for learning...",
