Congratulations to all\n\ngraduates. The insert brought back many memories. I was one of 12 graduates in the first rural\n\nhigh school built in New Brunswick more years ago than I care to recall.\n\n\n\n\nIt seems odd to me that, in 2010, we still do not have a school system that allows students to\n\ngraduate when they meet the requirements. Students enter school at different levels and learn\n\nat different rates while in school; given that they take essentially the same program how come\n\nthey all complete at the same time? Why not establish clear graduation requirements, award\n\ndiplomas when students meet the requirements, wish them well and let them be on their way.\n\n\n\n\nA few years ago, I monitored some students following a self-paced program at Holland College.\n\nIt was nominally of two years duration; some students finished 4- 5 months early without any\n\nmeasurable lowering of performance. Allowing people to learn at their own pace (they do so\n\nanyway regardless of school schedules) could be a major incentive in its own right. Giving prizes\n\nand awards for meeting standards early would likely be an additional incentive.\n\n\n\n\nMaking time the variable may complicate the life of school administrators, and maybe even\n\nteachers, but it would sure put a new spring in the step of most students.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSincerely\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDon Glendenning\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAppeared in Charlottetown Guardian on July 73, 2070 as \"A new approach to Graduation\"",

One of the most frequently mentioned concerns\nby Islanders is the low literacy levels among adults as reported via\nPISA results, recent CFPEI survey of Island youth,\npresentation to the Standing Committee by the Charlottetown Area\nChamber of Commerce, a 2014 survey by survey by the PEI Home and\nSchool Federation and a series of workshops on Preparedness held\nthroughout PEI by Education 20/20 Inc.  The most frequently\nmentioned concern among Islanders, and especially among employers, is\nthe low level of basic skills, especially mathematics, communication\nand personal management skills.  Education 20/20 held  a series of\nworkshops across PEI on the results of the CFPEI survey; the\nMathematics Gap initiative is a further step in our exploration of\nmath skills needed to function in a modern economy. For the purpose\nof these notes I refer to math skills although others refer to\nnumeracy, essential skills, math outcomes and math competencies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeeting 1;\n\nA working group\n(Duffy, Miller, White-Hassler, Greyborn and Glendenning) met on\nFriday, January 9, 2015 to explore the issue.  Our exploration was\nframed in terms of a labour market mismatch between skills of\navailable labour and skill needed.  While the issue, appears to be\none of a training gap, it is equally possible that the issue may be\none of the education mix, timely delivery, employers specifications\nor institutional documentation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tLABOUR MARKET\n\t\nDemand\t\t\t\t\tSources\n\tof supply\n\t\nIndividuals\t\t\t\t\tSchools\t\t\n\t\nEmployers\t\t\t\t\tPostsecondary\n\t\nEducational\n\tInstitutions\t...",

In my own mind, the two are soul\nmates with OBE being the broad descriptor when speaking of education\nand competencies being a description of the outcome at the interface\nwith a learner.  I must hasten to add, however, that this is a\npersonal view rather than one shared broadly in the profession.  It\nis not surprising, therefore, that even a quick scan of websites of\nProvincial Departments of Education, quickly reveals the extent to\nwhich educational planning has been influenced by the Outcomes Based \nEducation movement, especially in the area of curriculum development.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAcademic\neducators then, and mostly still today, focused on content,  that is\ndividing subjects such as mathematics, literature, science  and so\nforth into courses and lectures for the purpose of teaching and\nlearning.

Don argues current discussions focus narrowly on schools, storms, technology, and classroom matters rather than larger agenda: preparing all Islanders (all ages, interests) for current and future challenges. He emphasizes education as service helping people with learning, though many view it as product delivery (credits, diplomas, degrees). Don proposes mechanisms for dialogue: PEI Board of Education (12-person general oversight, like Washington State or Holland College Board), curriculum advisory committees including students/parents/employers/post-secondary/certification bodies, and community education commons.

As a result, and on reflection, the writer is of the view that our current constitution and bylaws interfere with the consultative process rather than fosters it; furthermore, the writer believes a broader consultative process should be restored and reinforced.\u00a0 To do this, changes in, or interpretations of, the constitution and by laws will be required.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nISSUES\n\n\n\n\nThe following issues appear to be in play:\n\n\n\n\nMembership\n\n\n\n\nBylaws says the following about membership in the association:\n\n\n\n\nArticle 401 \t\u201cmembership in the Association shall consist of all lot owners and subsequent lot owners\u201d.\u00a0 Does this mean that, if a lot is in the name of two or more people,...",

Don defines governance as \"who makes what decisions, and in what manner.\" He identifies underlying confusions between education/schooling and credentials/qualifications. The paper extensively documents that research shows direct relationship between school autonomy and student performance (citing OECD PISA data). Don emphasizes teachers should serve as \"educational family doctors\" with accountability for learner outcomes. He proposes clear decision-making assignments: learners/parents select schools and programs, teachers make professional decisions for assigned learners, principals focus on instructional leadership, trustees/superintendents operate schools, Deputy Ministers ensure quality education for all Islanders. Includes detailed Albertan school board decision examples and PEI trustee responsibilities. Advocates for immediate changes: consolidate educational responsibilities, delegate administrative decisions, clarify principal roles, assign student decisions to teachers, establish independent qualification authority. Later \"Thoughts on School Governance\" section dated May 25, 2012 emphasizes governance model could remove change barriers when combined with professional freedom and accountability.

Central to his vision is Benjamin Bloom's taxonomy and his observation that public schools remain stuck at the comprehension level rather than advancing students through analysis, synthesis, and evaluation. Don argues that vocational programs excel precisely because they clearly define performance levels in workplace-relevant language, distinguishing them from academic programs.",
  "content_preview": "Beyond Knowledge\n\n\n\n\nIn hindsight, I had been seeking a competency based approach to education for many years. Perhaps the stage was set by the learning model found in a text book by S. R. Laycock, a professor of Education at the University of Saskatchewan; his description of the learning process impressed me and stayed with me.\u00a0 Later as my interests and studies moved beyond grades and subjects to education, the need for a more meaningful way to organize instruction became even more evident\n\n\n\n\nIn hindsight, stages or steps in my journey include:\n\n\n\n\nDesigning training programs, at least vocational ones, took me beyond textbooks and disciplines, and into the community and work place.\u00a0 Text books come later, if at all.\n\nExperience in vocational education where the first task of the teacher therefore is to find out what practitioners do, and then to prepare students to do likewise.\n\nDetailed curriculum planning required to ensure that the training being offered addresses skills, knowledge and attitudes required for a chosen career.\n\nMy involvement in teacher education especially in the teaching of methods and curriculum development.\n\nMy exposure to discussions about nationwide standards so that skilled workers can meet qualifications required in any jurisdiction.\n\nAn introduction to programmed instruction or programmed learning in the 1960\u2019s.\n\nDACUM, the results of an occupational analysis presented on a single page\u00a0 and used by learners and teachers alike as well as a basis for recording progress.\n\n\n\n\nThen came the Taxonomy of Learning\u00a0 by Benjamin Bloom in which he not only identified three domains of learning, cognitive, affective and psychomotor, but also levels of learning for each domain.\n\n\n\n\nIn the cognitive domain, the most often cited, Bloom identified six levels of learning with the lowest level being knowledge and the highest level being evaluation.\u00a0 Students climb the ladder of learning starting with knowledge and work their way up through comprehension, ...",

He explains his conviction that PEI needed a technical college distinct from university education, one providing training for occupations both within and beyond the island. This essay defines the philosophical differences between colleges and universities: colleges emphasize applied knowledge, intensive specialty study, field-derived content, employment success metrics, integrated theory and practice, and industry partnerships.

  "summary": "Don criticizes traditional education's time-based administrative system where learners must begin and end on fixed schedules regardless of learning progress. He argues schools should operate more like hospitals, keeping students under care until they reach acceptable performance levels. At Holland College, Don experimented with continuous or staggered entry and exit, allowing students to begin programs when spaces became available rather than on rigid semesters. He acknowledges implementation challenges, particularly with small one- or two-instructor programs, but maintains the concept's validity. The essay reflects tension between administrative convenience and pedagogical effectiveness.",
  "content_preview": "Continuous Intake\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nElsewhere in these my musings, I referred to the fact that education is driven by an out-dated administrative system where time on task is the constant and performance the variable.\u00a0 The system focuses on groups not individuals and forces learners to begin and end studies, not based on learning progress but at the sound of a bell.\u00a0 Teachers are required to fashion their teaching to fit available time rather than the system accommodating the needs of students. Learning theory collides with administrative practice and administration usually wins. The rigidity of the system, in my view, is a major deterrent to change.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nThe reverse should be the case.\u00a0 Doctors keep you under care or in the hospital until you are better; teachers should keep you in their care until you perform at an acceptable level.\n\n\n\n\nElsewhere I identified a number of beliefs or principles followed in designing the Holland College approach to learning and teaching.\u00a0 One was the students should be able to enter or exit a program on their own time \u2013 that is, make time, not achievement, the variable.\u00a0 Exiting on completion was not a problem,\u00a0 except that it made graduation exercises difficult to organize; staggered or continuous intake, however, was different.\n\n\n\n\nEntry and exit times to programs, courses and units are prescribed by the \u201csystem\u2019 as are the number of days or hours of instruction available to each learner for each subject studied, and grades are awarded based upon how much was learned in the time available.\u00a0 Even colleges and universities, institutions with considerable control of their operation, operate on a time based system \u00a0 In addition to being at odds with real life, it paces instruction at a rate well below the rate of learning of many students; neither allows nor gives incentives to move through the system more quickly and results in some students listlessly waiting for the teacher and other members of the class to catch up.\u00a0 Even after spending a lif...",

  "summary": "Don critiques communication gaps in PEI's education system, identifying three main concerns: (1) Department conflates \"education\" with schooling, creating terminology confusion; (2) Department's narrow role limits delivery to youth while other populations lack leadership and quality monitoring; (3) Communities feel forgotten despite education's responsibility to serve residents and communities. Uses construction worker shortage as example. Advocates for clearer language in media releases. Reports on Melrose, Massachusetts' competency-based education (CBE) program attempting to \"fundamentally rethink traditional schooling.\" Notes students appreciate freedom but teachers struggle with loss of control. Recommends Melrose and Hanover High School (NH) as \"must see\" examples. Discusses Common Core State Standards and need for better instructional support materials and student-responsive learning design.",

The school located classes throughout the city in libraries, galleries, churches, and available spaces rather than in traditional buildings, with teachers' first task being to secure meeting space. Don reflects that while interesting then, schools without walls are now more feasible given internet information access, competency-based education, performance assessment, computers, and individual learner management systems. He proposes two implementation scenarios: apprenticeship programs using competency analyses with learning managers (unlike teachers, more akin to physicians) who identify needs, create learning plans, secure opportunities, and provide feedback. The learning manager contracts specialized instruction and arranges apprenticeship testing and placement with employers. Similar models could work for mathematics, communication, history, art, and music.",

Glendenning documents various cheating trends\u2014plagiarism software arms races, file-sharing mentality, test anxiety, grade inflation\u2014and identifies systemic causes: poor teaching, lack of rapport, and emphasis on grades over learning. He argues that traditional subject-based testing is vulnerable to cheating, while competency-based programs, which assess observable real-world performance over multiple occasions, make cheating nearly impossible.

  "summary": "Introduction by Don Glendenning to \"The Glendenning Letters\" (April 15, 2014) describing his educational background as a \"sandwich education\" spanning 20 years with alternating layers of study and teaching, supplemented by summer schools. He details his career progression through elementary, secondary, and principal roles, teacher training, and federal government positions before becoming founding president of Holland College. Don explains his choice to write letters to editors rather than academic journals, believing systemic education change comes from citizen and parent pressure rather than internal system reform. He collected 62 published letters and notes many unpublished drafts. The introduction emphasizes public discourse over traditional academic publishing as his contribution to education debate.",
  "content_preview": "Dear Reader:\n\n\n\n\nThe Glendenning Letters\n\n\n\n\nMine was a sandwich education spread over 20 years after high school graduation. A layer of\n\nStudy, perhaps a year or two, followed by a layer of teaching, then another layer of study and so\n\non, all seasoned with endless summer schools. As a result, I ended up with experience as a\n\nteacher in both the elementary and secondary levels, a principal, six years a teacher\n\ntrainer and the same as a training specialist with the Federal government. During the same\n\nperiod I earned several degrees, and held licenses to teach both academic and vocational\n\nsubjects. That sandwich nourished me in my role as Founding President of Holland College, a\n\ncommunity college established in Prince Edward lsland to broaden the range of educational\n\nservices available to lslanders. I write this only to support the view that my sandwich was\n\ncustom made, was somewhat unique and may result in a different perspective.\n\n\n\n\nFor a number of years I wrote a column for the Canadian Vocational Journal. ln 1995 I wrote my first letter to the Editor of the Charlottetown Guardian; it was about education in Atlantic\n\nCanada and is the first letter in the pages that follow. That letter was a simple response to an\n\nitem of interest; 18 years later with our education system under scrutiny and pressure to\n\nchange, a friend suggested that these letters be brought together and made available to the\n\npublic as a stimulus for discussion. This volume is the result.\n\n\n\n\nI found or reconstructed some 62 letters, all of which were actually published; there were\n\nperhaps a half dozen not included because they were short and congratulatory notes, were not\n\nabout education, were sent to a different newspaper, or may not have been published. I also\n\nfound an equal number of letters in various stages of readiness; some of the latter look more\n\ninteresting than the published ones. Most of the letters would have benefitted from editing,\n\nrewriting or even not having been writ...",

In recent years, and under MacMillan\u2019s leadership, the College has been an initiator of programs in support of the arts and cultural life of both Charlottetown and the Province.\u00a0 This initiative has come first in the form of new programming in partnership with the Confederation Centre of the Arts, and most recently in the form of the Florence Simmons Performing Arts Centre. \u00a0 Under his leadership, the College generally has been a magnet for redevelopment of the eastern entrance to the capital city.\n\nAs for Brian himself, he is a person with strong family ties, well-honed personal skills and leadership capabilities.\u00a0 His interest in and concern for staff is\u00a0 evident and the College has been recognized as a quality employer.\u00a0 I know that he is active both nationally and internationally but do not know the details.\n\n\u00a0\n\nI have no hesitation in supporting this nomination.\n\n\n\n\nSincerely\n\n\u00a0\n\nDon Glendenning, C.M.",

All agencies seem to undertake the analysis\nprocess as though what they are doing is unique to them.  I\u2019ve\nlooked at a number of outcomes and find that the differences are\nmostly one of level of specificity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFurthermore,\nmy exploration reveals that the differences in educational\nachievement rests primarily on two factors, (1) the range of\ncompetencies a person can demonstrate and  (2) the level that each\nperson can demonstrate on each competency. Based on this view, it\nshould be possible to establish a comprehensive list of competencies\nthat span all grade levels and age groups.  Students either select or\nare assigned the competency to be learned; the difference between any\ntwo learners in any competency is only the level of achievement that\ncan be demonstrated.  A teacher\u2019s role is to help learners select\nthe competencies needed and to raise the learner\u2019s level of\nachievement on each.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI\nhave had a number of conversations about math with representatives of\nUPEI, Holland College, Department of Education, employers and\ncommunity members and, while not saying that there is support for\nthis specific proposal, there is interest in some quarters for\nfurther exploration.  Based on the above, we believe that PEI should\ndevelop, and would benefit from, a master list of competencies and a\nrating scale to match.  The idea is not new, seems to be widely\npractices in Ontario and elsewhere.  Some countries try to accomplish\nthrough the same feature the establishment of \u201cqualification\nauthorities\u201d,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeveloping\nsuch a map, we believe, would assist in improving quality education,\nreducing costs, including communication, easing transition, securing\nan even better range of study resour...",

He begins with foundational concepts of teaching and learning, distinguishing between schooling and education based on Good's Dictionary definitions. Don identifies six life roles as essential starting points for educational planning and criticizes the gap between parent/taxpayer expectations and professional educator priorities. He argues that clear, unambiguous, measurable outcomes are essential for effective educational planning and that outcomes should prepare graduates for life and work, not just further academic study. Don provides detailed characteristics of educational outcomes (drawn from community, observable/measurable, clear/unambiguous, performance-based assessment) and contrasts them with curriculum-based outcomes. He includes recommendations for outcome development, reporting structures, and cites John Burke's work on competency-based education.",

Most of the critical\narticles express concerns\nthat the education system cannot adequately prepare students for life\nand work in the 21st Century.\nI am concerned about that issue also.  The rereading, together with a\nscan of the internet and my own experience in the education field,\nconfirmed my view that there is a major difference between\nparents/taxpayers and professional educators about the role of\nschools.  I call it expectations but outcomes, perhaps, may an even\nbe a better descriptor.  As background, let me say a few words about\nteaching and learning.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.\nIn several states, educators and policy makers are attempting to\nchange the way we measure the effectiveness of education from an\nemphasis on traditional inputs, such as course credits earned and\nhours spent in class, to results or outcomes. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTeaching\nand Learning\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearning\nis a process of change.  When a learner learns, he/she acquires more\nor different information, skills or attitudes, or, in the words of\neducators, change may occur in the cognitive, affective or\npsychomotor domains.  Simply put, a person who has learned has new or\ndifferent attitudes, skills or information or some combination\nthereof. Learning is very much an individual matter; only the learner\ncan learn.  To help a learner to learn is to help bring about changes\nin the learner.  The stimulus for learning may be internal or\nexternal and the actual learning may take place in a group setting or\nwhen the individual is alone.  A teacher does not teach a class; a\nteacher teaches a number of individuals at the same time in a group\nsetting.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe\nrole of a teacher is to stimulate learning \u2013 to create a set of\ncircumstances so that a learner changes behaviour.

  "summary": "Don addresses three major challenges to educational reform. First, he advocates for continuous intake programs where students enter/exit based on achievement rather than fixed calendar periods, contrasting rigid time-based systems with outcome-based approaches like those at Holland College. He argues that staggered enrollment supports diverse learning rates and real-world employment patterns. Second, Don discusses Prior Learning Assessment (PLA), emphasizing it should be integrated into ongoing teaching rather than treated as separate gatekeeping. He warns against portfolio-heavy approaches that isolate PLA from the curriculum. Third, he proposes a \"Record of Achievement\" as an alternative to traditional transcripts\u2014a comprehensive document recording significant skills, knowledge, and attitudes demonstrated throughout schooling, addressing employer expectations beyond university entrance requirements. He also outlines AQUA (Atlantic Provinces Qualification Authority) concept and includes detailed information on New Zealand's national qualifications framework and the Canadian Restructured School Plan (CRSP) model.",
  "content_preview": "Outside the Box Today\n\n\n\n\nContinuous Intake\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nElsewhere in these my musings, I referred to the fact that education is driven by an out-dated administrative system where time on task is the constant and performance the variable.\u00a0 The system focuses on groups not individuals and forces learners to begin and end studies, not based on learning progress but at the sound of a bell.\u00a0 Teachers are required to fashion their teaching to fit available time rather than the system accommodating the needs of students. Learning theory collides with administrative practice and administration usually wins. The rigidity of the system, in my view, is a major deterrent to change.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nThe reverse should be the case.\u00a0 Doctors keep you under care or in the hospital until you are better; teachers should keep you in their care until you perform at an acceptable level.\n\n\n\n\nElsewhere I identified a number of beliefs or principles followed in designing the Holland College approach to learning and teaching.\u00a0 One was the students should be able to enter or exit a program on their own time \u2013 that is, make time, not achievement, the variable.\u00a0 Exiting on completion was not a problem,\u00a0 except that it made graduation exercises difficult to organize; staggered or continuous intake, however, was different.\n\n\n\n\nEntry and exit times to programs, courses and units are prescribed by the \u201csystem\u2019 as are the number of days or hours of instruction available to each learner for each subject studied, and grades are awarded based upon how much was learned in the time available.\u00a0 Even colleges and universities, institutions with considerable control of their operation, operate on a time based system \u00a0 In addition to being at odds with real life, it paces instruction at a rate well below the rate of learning of many students; neither allows nor gives incentives to move through the system more quickly and results in some students listlessly waiting for the teacher and other members of the class to catch up.\u00a0...",

Those who teach, or otherwise serve learners,\nmust be very clear in their communication. Conceptual clarity\nheightens our understanding of key words and concepts; lack of\nclarity is a significant issue for public education.

He reflects on early carpentry work at Chatham Air Base (summer 1948) where employees learned through immediate immersion in real tasks, progressing from simple to complex skills. Holland College adopted this \"spiral curriculum\" approach\u2014students begin with field-specific interest courses rather than foundational prerequisites. This inverted model capitalizes on learner interests, reduces first-year dropout rates, equips early departures with employable skills, and reflects actual work-world experience. Don contrasts this with traditional approach of loading first-year with general subjects (mathematics, physics, chemistry, communications). He argues the inverted pyramid better suits older workers who gained work experience before formal education and took courses opportunistically throughout their careers.",

  "content_preview": "June 28, 2022\n\nRestrutuing June 28\n\nIt is widely recognized that education is a key factor in determining each citizen\u2019s quality of life; in the same way, the collective education of our citizens will determine to a significant degree the quality of the communities in which we live. Government support is justified for two reasons, one to support personal growth and development for every citizen and (2) to ensure the common good. Educating is a complex matter made so by the fact that each person is unique in many ways, unique in basic physical, mental, emotional make-up; unique in the range and nature of previous experience, unique in perceived futures, but also unique in terms of learning pace, style and needs.\n\n\n\n\nAn education system is a set of services put in place by a community to encourage and support the education of its citizens; given the numbers served and the wide range of prior experience, capabilities and interests of learners, designing and operating an education system is no easy task. These complexities have given rise to the following structural issues:\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n1.\tTerminology \u2013 Educators are creative people; they try to accommodate a number of concepts with a single term. Learning excellence is an example. On the other hand, the writer seldom finds definitions in educational writings and certainly\u00a0 is left with the impression that going to school, in all its configurations, naturally leads to a good education.\n\n2.\tPurpose \u2013 Purpose provides the fundamental reason for establishing an organization, a reason for which some-thing is done or created; it is also the key element in the structuring process and one from which all others follow. To be meaningful, a purpose statement must be easy to understand, explain why the work is important, contribute to the alignment of activities, and be manageable. While the PEI literature carries a variety of purposes with perhaps that of New Brunswick being most specific \u201c My search for the purpose of public education i...",

  "content_preview": "14-Differentiated Staffing\n\n}'\n\n\n\n\nEarly schools began with teachers, often-itinerant ones, and teaching students in any convenient location. To me, this conjures up a teacher standing or sitting under a tree while rapt students sit \"at his feet\" soaking up every word. Over time, the concept grew and a century ago the one -room country school became a mainstay of most communities. I went to one of these schools and distinctly remember listening to instruction intended for older students and, on occasion, even interrupting to answer a teacher's question. Later came multi-room schools, in some cases with teachers operating just as independently as if they were still in a one-room school. The idea of one teacher per class and classroom is still prevalent today. Change comes slowly in any business especially in one as conservative as education.\n\n\n\n\nA typical secondary school, I am told, is likely to have a principal, vice principal\n\n\n\n\nSometimes it seems as though we have lost sight of the reason for schools and decided to operate them in a manner that is administratively convenient regardless on the effect on learners. Staffing patterns is one example. Teacher student ratios are set and there is little opportunity to experiment with alternatives. As a result, schools are top heavy with full-time professional teachers and light on part-time teachers and professional support Although teacher aides are used, from my knowledge, they are mostly limited to working with students with special needs.\n\n\n\n\nIf one looks at other service organizations, one finds a significant growth of wellqualified support statT, some would call them paraprofessionals. Legal offices and churches are but two examples. Many professions have expanded the use of paraprofessionals - doctors, dentists and accountants are examples with their use of nurses, receptionists and assistants. Even our churches are accepting the concept of team ministry. Education has been a holdout in sticking to one teacher fo...",

Some of the confusion, I believe, is a deliberate; some results from sloppy thinking.\n\n\n\n\nVocational education refers to studies undertaken for the purpose of finding or maintaining employment. It describes the purpose of the learner rather than the content learned. Vocational education may lead to employment at any level be it the skilled craftsman, technician, technologist or professional.\n\n\n\n\nTechnical education, on the other hand, is a field of study; it may be likened to a discipline. The field is technology - that is the study of applied science whether that be in traditional engineering, business or the medical field.\n\n\n\n\nIn describing the growth of applied science, I often think of Alexander Graham Bell in working in his laboratory in Baddeck, Nova Scotia over 100 years ago.
