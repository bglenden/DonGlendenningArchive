  "summary": "A November 30, 2014 solicitation letter from Don Glendenning to Roger Birt seeking support for a numeracy education research project. Don identifies a gap in PEI's math education: although test scores have improved, workers lack practical numeracy skills. He frames numeracy (quick, accurate application of mathematical knowledge) as a solution and proposes funding a $15,000 analysis of math skills used by Islanders. The letter reveals Don's sophisticated understanding of educational assessment, his willingness to bring in external expertise when needed, and his ability to identify specific, measurable problems and propose data-driven solutions. This correspondence exemplifies his role as an educational innovator and leader.",
