The slug '99-2-rating-scale' is the larger file (5,559 bytes vs 5,044 bytes) and appears to be the more complete version; this one has only minor wording differences and no additional substance.",

    "reason": "A forwarded email from Tom White-Hassler to Don (and two others) sharing a Maria Popova blog post reproducing Bertrand Russell's 'Liberal Decalogue.' The substantive content is entirely third-party (Russell's 1951 NYT Magazine piece and Popova's commentary), not Don's writing. While it shows Don's intellectual interests and correspondence circle, it is essentially a third-party publication forwarded to him rather than personal correspondence.",
