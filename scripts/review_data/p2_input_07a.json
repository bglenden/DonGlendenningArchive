Drawing from the Oregon Education Act's six life roles (individual, learner, producer, consumer, family member, citizen), he argues all people benefit at some point from instructional support. He identifies the fundamental challenge: while schools fill important roles, society hasn't clearly expressed expectations about their function. Don contrasts business models (investment/consumer purchase) with education, which involves overlapping stakeholder interests (learners, service providers, investors, employers). He identifies a critical gap: educators measure quality by inputs (subjects, schooling years, institutions, instructor qualifications, technology, test scores) while taxpayers and employers judge by outputs\u2014what graduates can do. Schools measure input and infer performance; the public rates performance directly. Don argues little progress in raising standards will occur until these conflicting measurement frameworks are reconciled, requiring dialogue that aligns training program content with community standards.",

Teachers shape lives and help learners develop new attitudes, skills, and knowledge. Don emphasizes learning is individual\u2014only the learner can learn\u2014and teaching creates change conditions. He reiterates his core principle: \"A teacher hasn't taught if a learner hasn't learned,\" applied to each learner. Teachers stimulate learning through varied techniques: modeling, information provision, questioning, timelines, projects, field trips, and performance assessment. The crux of good teaching is creating favorable learning environments for each individual within group settings. Don notes schools organize around academic disciplines with assigned hours and teachers hired accordingly, resulting in report cards with subject ratings disconnected from life roles except future academic study. The essay implies this structure inadequately prepares learners for their actual future roles as individuals, learners, producers, consumers, family members, and citizens. The essay suggests a fundamental need to align schooling structures with adult life role preparation.",

  "summary": "The January 20, 2014 eleventh issue, edited by Don Glendenning, examines PISA (Program for International Student Assessment) results and their implications. Don cautions that while PISA provides useful feedback and international comparison, test results should not drive all educational decisions. He highlights an OECD survey of 11 participating countries showing that schools with greater autonomy tend to perform better on PISA. Critically, Don notes that when schools account publicly for results through achievement data, greater autonomy correlates with better performance, but without accountability arrangements, autonomous schools can perform worse. This balanced perspective reflects Don's sophisticated understanding of educational governance. The newsletter reminds readers of the January 20 workshop on youth preparedness and directs readers to OECD resources. Don recommends the Vancouver Sun article on British Columbia school report card reforms.",

Accountability represents \"the process of making, keeping and managing promises and expectations\u2026 being liable or answerable for overall outcomes.\" Applying this to schools, Don argues teachers are responsible for ensuring students learn, while principals as instructional leaders are accountable for students gaining skills needed for postsecondary education or employment. Students and parents also bear responsibility for school success.

He observes vocational education's shift from content-based to performance-measured definitions and the federal government's reduced leverage for change. Don argues the CVA could become a catalyst for educational change, particularly around \"transition\" from school to employment. Responding to summit questions about high points, current functioning, and future vision, Don emphasizes the value of personal networking and provincial connections developed at annual conferences.

He defines learning as behavioral change across cognitive, affective, and psychomotor domains. A key insight is that \"a teacher hasn't taught if a learner hasn't learned,\" applied to each individual learner.

  "summary": "\"Dear Editor\" letter presenting comprehensive critique of PEI education system's conflation of education and schooling. Argues Department sends mixed messages, treating education and school attendance as synonymous, and narrowing mission to program development/curriculum rather than educational transformation. Distinguishes schools (like hospitals or spas) as resource locations where education occurs through services provided. Urges Department to \"review, clarify and restate its mission, goals, objectives and guiding principles\" and initiate community conversations immediately, calling this most urgent team-building activity possible.",

  "summary": "Addresses education's lack of conceptual clarity as fundamental barrier to improvement. Don critiques imprecise terminology and boundaries in education discourse, noting education's reputation for jargon (\"educationese\"). Specific examples: \"Education and Lifelong Learning\" treated as separate when lifelong learning is inherent; \"helping young people find a place in society\" lacks actionable specificity; Department focuses on \"developing and delivering programs\" rather than educational outcomes. Calls for clear definitions, comparing PEI's approach unfavorably to Alberta's (\"preparing citizens for tomorrow\") and New Brunswick's (\"attributes for lifelong learning\").",
