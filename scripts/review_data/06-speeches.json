Brief outline containing: appreciation for invitation; thanks to group for community contributions; reference to community member Annie Gulliver and her story about writing junior matrics (\"Does your mother know\" - possible song or cultural reference), attending one-room rural school at age 17, and promise to add story about MRHS (Maritime Rural High School?). Sketch outline lacks substantive development, suggesting preliminary notes or incomplete draft. Reference to rural education and one-room schools suggests nostalgic connection to educational past. Presence in education binder materials suggests Don drew on historical education examples or community stories to illustrate contemporary education analysis. May represent planned public engagement with education reform themes.",

Education is a service; school is a\nplace. Experiences in school are major contributors to one\u2019s\neducation but it is the experience not the school that counts.  It is\nlike the preparation of the food rather than the management of the\nrestaurant.\n\nConceptual\nclarity is a must to understand the people we serve, the services we\nprovide, learner needs, product, processes and values especially when\nthe subject carries layers of subjectivity.  \n\n\nWe\ncertainly need schools but it is time to focus on the learning\nexperiences rather than the places where they happen.",

Fields are divided into subjects, courses and\nunits and lectures or lessons for the purpose of teaching and\nlearning. Assignments and assessment followed suit.  One\u2019s\neducation, at least the part experienced in school, became the study\nof a series of discrete experiences too seldom integrated into a\ncoherent life related whole.  Vocational educators, on the other\nhand, based their planning and teaching on an analysis of skills of\nan occupation , and more recently, skill programs focus on\ncompetrencies.  Perhaps the best known approach, DACUM, was developed\nin Nova Scotia and has since spread world wide\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOBE\nchanges the focus of education from content to learners and organizes\nteaching and learning around outcomes and measures change based on\nperformance regardless of when the learning took place.  According to\nWilliam Spady, a sociologist xxxat the University and one yime\nprofessor at the Ontario Institute for Studies in Education in\nToronto, outcomes could be written with \u201ctraditional,\ntransitional, or transformational goals in mind\u201d.   It appears that\nthe leadership in OBE dealt with broad principles only; as a result\nthere are no recognized standards for identifying out comes or\nimplementing OBE. As a result, there are many versions of OBE, most\nfocusing on outcomes only. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpady\u02bcs\n\u201cOBE Paradigm\u201d (1994) is based on three premises and four\nprinciples.\n\n\nThe\npremises are:\n\n\n1.\nAll students can learn and succeed but not on the same day and not in\n\n\nthe\nsame way;\n\n\n2.\nSuccessful learning promotes even more successful learning; and\n\n3.\nSchools control the conditions that affect directly affect successful\n\n\nlearning.\n\n\nThe\nfour \u201cpower principles\u201d are:\n\n\n1.\nClarity of focus on culminating outcomes of significance;\n\n\n2.\nExpanded opportunity and support for learning success;\n\n\n3.\nHi...",

We are in the business of connecting people who care with causes that matter. Most charitable organizations ask for donations for their specific cause. Community foundations ask donors about their charitable interests and find a way to support them.\u00a0 Donor interests empower us to support a wide range of worthy causes on an ongoing basis. \u00a0\n\n\t\tThis year, for example,\n\nIn health care, we\u2019ve helped a Souris area seniors club purchase a defibrillator; given scholarships in healthcare for people living and working\u00a0 in Eastern Kings; assisted with establishing a cardiac awareness center in Tryon, made a donation to the PCH Maternal Child Care Unit; and as well as to the QEH & PCH Foundations\n\n\n\n\nIn education, we made donations to support library and music programs in a number of Island schools, and we\u2019ve provided scholarships for Island students to honor the work of Canada games organizers Orin Carver and Joseph Spriet, and of the late Senator Lorne Bonnell, and of Joan Auld, and of the Summerside Natick Friendship Hockey tournament, and for three students to go off Island to further their education in Architecture.\u00a0\n\nIn community projects we\u2019ve suppo...",

The\nbasis of the workshops is a survey of youth issues undertaken by the\nCommunity Foundation of Prince Edward Island; the survey gathered\ninformation and sought the views of more than 200 young people\nbetween the ages of 15 and 25.  The report may be read on the\nFoundation website, www.cfpei.ca.\n The report identifies a number of \u2018concerns and bright spots\u201d;\none of the concerns is that of \u201cpreparedness gaps\u201d in regard to\npostsecondary education and the workplace.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBecause\nwe believe that the issues raised in the report are important,\nEducation 20/20 is hosting a series of workshops throughout the\nIsland so that Islanders can learn first-hand of the findings.  Each\nworkshop, therefore, will start with a presentation by Steve\nMacQuaid, Vice President of the Community Foundation of Prince Edward\nIsland, and Katherine MacDonald, Researcher, on survey methodology\nand findings, a period of 30-45 minutes depending on questions from\nthe group.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe second part\nof the evening will consist of round-table discussions, the number of\ndiscussion groups will depend on the number of participants, but our\nobjective is to have many discussions rather than consolidate around\nfewer tables.  Each table will have a facilitator, someone to keep\nthe discussion moving, to ensure that all have a chance to voice\nopinions and that the discussion is respectful. To allow the\nfacilitator to focus on the discussion, we suggest a separate\nrecorder to provide a summary of key points at the end of the evening\nand to pass a set of notes to the chair at the end of the evening. \nIt is usually useful to open round-table discussions by \u201cgoing\nround the table\u201d and inviting comment from each person before\nopening the general discussion.

Characteristics include independent governance, fee-for-service operation, direct or referral-based client acceptance, performance-based certification, provision of competency gap information, and extensive use of advisory panels.

Those who teach, or other-wise serve learners, must be very clear in their communication. Conceptual clarity heightens our understanding of key words and concepts; lack of clarity is a significant issue for public education.\u00a0 It must be addressed directly so that the concept of education won\u2019t become d-luted and potentially ineffective.

We have been working hard to represent the values of our school through an on-going project. Our school had students vote on what \"Prince\" in Prince Street stands for, and decided on P-Proud, R-Respect, I-Inclusive, N-Never Give Up, C-Caring and E-Empathy. Students and staff also decided on a school mascot and logo, and wrote and recorded a school song with the assistance of an artist and an ArtsSmarts PEI grant. This year we have started monthly assemblies to assist with proactive teaching, understanding, and discussion about what the words proud, respect, inclusive, never give up, caring, and empathy mean. We have used the award money to purchase new curtains and upgrade our stage so that our school can look as good as we feel. Now when students are presenting, singing, and dancing on the stage they can do so in an environment they can be proud of. We are very grateful for this recognition and the opportunity to improve our school for students and their learning.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThank you,\n\n\u00a0\n\nKelly Gillis\n\nVice Principal\n\nPrince Street Elementary\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n>>> \"Don Glendenning\" <pei@education2020.ca> 10/29/15 7:31 AM >>>\n\nWe are about to announce the Educational Award for 2016.\n\n\u00a0\n\nWould be interested in a few comments about what the award meant to your school and how you spent the money.\n\n\u00a0\n\nRegards\n\n\u00a0\n\nDon",

The document identifies typical functions and support services of education systems, provincial government mandates, and multiple service providers. It catalogs education issues including service gaps, politicization, lack of autonomy, and over-emphasis on knowledge.

  "summary": "This memo from Don to Tom Davies outlines strategic recommendations for CFPEI's development approach as Don transitions from the Development Committee chairmanship. The letter advocates for shifting focus from pursuing large donations from wealthy individuals to building broader donor bases through smaller contributions and community engagement. Don recommends targeting younger people (forties rather than seniors), organizing presentation-style information sessions in communities, and engaging entire board membership in development. He proposes establishing committees to scout trust fund opportunities (MacDonald, Carver, Cotton trusts), creating a Challenge Fund, developing a Charitable Legacy Account program, and leveraging special community projects like MacPhail Homestead. The memo reflects Don's evolving philosophy that \"dollars will follow\" from engagement rather than strategic asks.",

Obviously things will change here and one of his favorite sayings was \u201cwe are so far behind we are ahead\u201d . \u00a0 It was these qualities that lead us to the formation of this mechanism to enhance public spaces on Pei.

Key interventions include: (1) Shift terminology focus from schools to education; (2) Define purpose through learner life roles; (3) Identify and make education services universally accessible; (4) Restructure according to \"form follows function\" principle; (5) Grant autonomy to front-line teachers; (6) Apply accountability mechanisms with autonomy; (7) Implement in-service teacher training; (8) Address grading/credentialing through developed qualification bodies; (9) Establish a PEI Education Association. Supporting observations identify 36 systemic characteristics requiring change, from fragmentation and unclear purpose to inappropriate politicization and lack of trust.

Major section addresses Structural Issues (school/education confusion, clarity gaps, unclear purpose, product-focused structure, autonomy constraints, unstated accountabilities, cultural barriers, absence of market-driven self-correction mechanisms). Education Issues include competency vs. outcome confusion, collaboration barriers, inadequate progress reporting, relevance gaps, passive development role, narrow field focus, and student ranking problems.

He defends discussing controversial matters, critiques the supervisor role with humor, addresses automation and human capacity, and poses fundamental questions: Why do we need teachers? Why Departments of Education? Why administrators? Why schools? He proposes alternative models ranging from historical apprenticeship through contemporary professional models where teachers work independently, learners choose educators, and payment follows service delivery. Don envisions a future where instructional aids and programmed materials support home-based learning, specialists work in professional clinics, and state responsibility focuses on licensing and ensuring basic literacy. This visionary speech demonstrates Don's radical thinking about institutional change and futures thinking in education.",

He critiques how institutions award credentials based on pre-set programs that may not reflect real occupational requirements. Don distinguishes between degrees, diplomas, and certificates, finding transcripts more useful than general credentials. He argues employers rarely request formal credentials during hiring and suggests current credentialing systems fail to address employer concerns about communication skills, math/science knowledge, Canadian history, and work habits. The piece questions three fundamental issues: what credentials society needs, who should award them, and on what basis. Don advocates for reform of credentialing practices to better serve both students and employers, moving beyond institutional convenience toward meaningful assessment of actual competencies needed in the workplace.",

Islanders think that the Department of Education has a responsibility for education at all levels; Department of Education documents define Education\u2019s role as serving youth.\n  \nEquating going to school with getting an education. In a 20i9 report, The World Bank, the world\u2019s largest funder of education services,\u00a0 cautioned Ministries of Education about the confusion of treating \u201ceducation and going to school\u201d as though they are one and the same; a review of PEI education documents suggests that PEI has also fallen into that trap. A school, like a hospital or shopping plaza, at best is only a resource rich location; education is influenced by student experiences while there.\u00a0\n  \nForm follows function is still the standard when structuring any venture; services provided by an education system to learners include information, counselling, instruction, assessment, learning products.\u00a0 Given this, one would expect senior management to reflect these functions in their position titles and for front line workers to have flexibility in responding to learner needs.\n  \nAccountability The OECD tells us that PISA results are better from schools with autonomy in their day-to-day operation; the World Bank advises Ministries of Education to delegate. Mathew Bedard of the Montreal Economic Institute points out that \u201cautonomy and accountability jointly applied\u201d would cost practically nothing and allow education to better adapt to the diversity of student needs and aptitudes. Yet teachers and principals in PEI appear to have little freedom to tailor services to suit individual learner needs.\n  \nGrades and grading, represents an attempt to apply standardized measurement to levels of achievement in a course or program; in the education context, each grade is consi...",

  "summary": "A revised and refined version of the \"Sort.doc\" essay, presenting Don's arguments about credentialing with improved structure and clarity. The document addresses the same themes: questioning credential usefulness in determining actual competence, criticizing how institutions pre-determine curricula limiting student choice, highlighting the disconnect between institutional criteria and occupational standards, and emphasizing schools' dual role as teaching institutions and sorting mechanisms. The revision demonstrates Don's iterative approach to developing his ideas for publication or presentation, suggesting this was an important argument he wanted to communicate effectively to education stakeholders.",
  "content_preview": "21 Should schools sort?\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCanadians like credentials. Places of work, whether they be trade, technical or professional, often display credentials of people who work there. I am not sure if such displays are intended to impress or intimidate. Many of credentials I encounter are issued by universities although some a few are issued by professional and technical associations.\u00a0 Such displays tell about some life choices that bearers have made such as where they went to school, the level of schooling they attained, and maybe some specialized courses they have taken.\u00a0 . Presumably they are placed in a conspicuous location to support the notion that the bearer, and the person providing you service, is competent to provide the service you are waiting for.\n\n\n\n\nAs the user of services provided by an establishment, I put this information in the category of interesting but not very useful. That is not to downplay the sweat equity people put into the acquisition of diplomas and degrees but seldom do the items on display tell me about the competence of the person about to serve me.\n\n\n\n\nTo qualify for a degree, diploma or certificate a person follows a pre-set program of studies\u00a0 determined by the institution, or an instructor in the institution, who may, or may not, have worked outside the institution, or of if he has, he did so many years earlier.\u00a0 In addition, the criteria may or may not reflect the criteria in the field or occupation in which the learner is preparing.\n\n\n\n\nAssessment is conducted by the institution, students are sorted by the institution, credentials are awarded based on which has a very limited opportunity for individual choice with the result that most students aiming for a diploma or degree having little opportunity to explore ideas of particular interest.
