Education: accumulated experiences with measurable effects on person's development. Education System: community services supporting people's development. Teaching: arranging experiences creating changes in others' knowledge, beliefs, and capabilities. These definitions distinguish education from schooling and position learners as active agents with complex backgrounds and multiple life roles, reflecting his learner-centered philosophy.",
  "content_preview": "About education\n\nGlendenning\u00a0\n\nKEY DEFINITIONS\n\nDoc 5\n\nEducation in Canada is a provincial responsibility; the role of a Province is to encourage, support and regulate education services; in the case of PEI. Although ducation services are not separately identified they appear to be mainly delivered through schools, college. universities and private schools. Although the system allows for independent study the writer is unsure at the moment just how that works. Like most Provinces, PEI appears to be serviced by a school system rather than an education system.\u00a0\n\nWhile it is likely that a taxonomy of common education terms used in PEI exists, the writer did not come across one; the following reflects the writer\u2019s views on key education concepts:\n\n  \nLearner \u2013 a person who, for whatever reason, needs, wants or is trying to bring about change in his/her life \u2013 trying to change an acritude, gain new knowledge, or add skills. But learners are neither empty jars nor blank slates; each learner carries three pieces of luggage to every new learning situation (1) certain physical, mental and emotional conditions with which a learner is born, (b) prior learning resulting from home circumstances, formal study, travel, state of health, personal interests, culture in which learner operates and (3) aspirations and imagined future including where one will live, the work one will do and the lifestyle one will have, nature of the family, quality of life, etc. .

None of my searches revealed the kind of document that\u00a0 I feel is necessary. It should be brief, a page or two at most; Holland College, based its early development a dozen or so foundational statements.\n\nWhile the process requires the input of educators, I\u2019m not sure that it should be led by an educator; I view education as a service to Islanders, this document is a public stafement as to the principles on which the system will be built.\u00a0 Could the committee be com[psed of MLA\u201ds?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI am not suggesting a Newfoundland or Nova Scotia style study; we should prepare the plan ourselves with outside help if needed.\u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor example, I happen to believe that learning is a personal matter, learners bring widely different levels of pitot learning to each learning activity and some learners learn more quickly than others.

He argues an \"A\" should clearly define performance\u2014does it mean writing clearly, having superior vocabulary, speaking logically? If so, say so; if not, what does it mean?

As the youngest in the\n\tfamily, I became the \u201ccookee\u201d while my older brothers ran the\n\tfarm.  Under mother\u2019s direction, I learned to make tea, cook\n\tvegetables, make stew, biscuits and gingerbread, and to do it all on\n\ta wood stove.  All my siblings survived.   \n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\tIt\n\twas a fairly sharp learning curve; the market for my product was\n\tsecure. Even though I knew new the market and recognized the\n\telements, vegetables, condiments and utensils. It was the pinch of\n\tsalt, simmer \u2018til brown and let the dough rise that I lacked.  The\n\tkey to improvement was a whole lot of practise of basic skills in a\n\treal life setting several times each day.  I\u2019m wondering if the\n\tsame doesn\u2019t apply to learning math as well.\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\tThere\u2019s\n\thardly a day goes by, it seems, that I don\u2019t encounter media\n\tstories about education, grade inflation and teacher preparation in\n\tOntario, curriculum in Alberta, declining grades in the USA and\n\tconcerns of Island employers. Improvements, at least those offered\n\tto the public, usually involves increasing the knowledge level. My\n\tsummer cooking experience, however, suggests increasing each\n\tstudent\u2019s experience and comfort level with basic applications\n\tcomes first.\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\tI\u2019m\n\tpleased to report that I still cook and have successfully added\n\tomelettes, fudge and pumpkin preserves to my skillset.

  "summary": "Don distinguishes between education as a service to learners versus education as a product focused on credentials. He argues that educational achievement should be demonstrated through practical competencies (writing, repairs, household management) rather than abstract credentials, and criticizes the prevalence of course numbers, credits, and grades in departmental communications. He advocates for educational reporting that reflects real-world competencies learners have developed, drawing implicit contrast with the current system's focus on administrative credentials and course structures rather than demonstrated capability.",

  "summary": "Glendenning analyzes organizational structures of Canadian education bodies (CAMET, CMEC) and provides critical comments on PEI education specifically. He identifies systemic problems: functions inadequately identified, major services not represented at organizational top levels, operations based on client institutions rather than service delivery, unclear roles and accountability, and confusion between \"going to school\" and \"getting an education.\" He recommends restructuring based on functions, writing clear role descriptions, and delegating decision-making downward. He notes that OECD research shows better educational outcomes in schools with operational autonomy. This assessment likely drove his broader reform agenda.",

  "summary": "Don recalls the labor-intensive pig-feeding process: a dedicated shed near the house contained a large brick-based cooker (approximately 6 by 3 by 1.5 feet) where turnips and potatoes were boiled. The process involved cooking, mashing in 10-quart pails with meal, then carrying to the barn. Don vividly remembers the pungent aroma of cooking turnips and a painful childhood incident where he slipped on wet snow and rammed his arm into a hot pot of potatoes, leaving a burn mark visible for years.",

And of course either water or milk depending on the age of the pigs and any surplus milk.\u00a0 In addition, a favourite at our place was either cooked potatoes or turnips. \u00a0\n\n\n\n\nThere was an old shed just outside our back door \u2013 probably 10 to 15 feet from the house.\u00a0 It was not large \u2013 perhaps 8 by 12 feet and inside was a huge cooker.\u00a0 I am not sure what the pot was made from but I think that it was probably 6 feet long and maybe three feet wide and 15 to 16 inches deep.\u00a0 As a kid, it seemed very large to me.\u00a0 It was set on a brick base so that a fire could be lighted under it.\n\n\n\n\nTurnips were dumped into the tub, water was added, the turnips were cooked.\u00a0 We likely cooked potatoes there as well abut I only remember the turnips.\u00a0 Cooking took a lot wood, which was hauled, to the shed on a hand sled.\u00a0 When finished, potatoes were put into a 10-quart pail, meal was added and the turnips were mashed by pushing a stick, a piece of stove wood from the woodpile, down into the pail.\u00a0 When the turnips cooled, they were carried to the barn and emptied into the pig\u2019s trough. \u00a0\n\n\n\n\nReaders who eat turnip will know the strong aroma; imagine cooking large quantities several times a week in a building only used for that purpose.\u00a0 By the way, the old cook shed was torn down in the early 1940\u2019s when John built a garage for our 1939 Ford truck.\n\n\n\n\nSometimes potatoes were cooked on the kitchen stove for the same purpose.\u00a0 A huge pot of potatoes would be boiled and the process would be repeated as with turnips.\n\n\n\n\nAt our house the kitchen stove was more or less at one end of the kitchen and the back door was reached through a little room at the other end.\u00a0 I remember once, a pot of hot potatoes hot off the stove was sitting on the floor near the back door.\u00a0 It was winter...",

The study examined training needs and employment barriers in this declining coastal community. Key findings: employers face shrinking labor pools and skill gaps, especially for specialized equipment; training institutions run at capacity; 40% of respondents had explored training in past three years; 59% prefer online instruction. Pressing needs identified include healthcare, small business, computer studies, and trades training. Study was conducted by MRSB (Maritime Regional School Board). The release emphasizes timeliness given PEI's growth and strong economy, requiring a flexible, skilled workforce.

A teacher\u2019s focus should be on helping a learner reach the desired level of achievement.\u00a0 All, or practically all, who enter are capable of reaching high levels of achievement.\u00a0 If it takes one learner a few days longer than another to complete the program, so what?\u00a0 The important thing is that students reach the desired level of performance. \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\n\n\nAnd what of standardized tests?\u00a0 People who plan and provide and pay for learning resources, the Minister and the bureaucracy, need information about actual and likely users of the education system so that they can make available learning resources and opportunities of the right kind and in the right mix.\u00a0 Planners need to know the nature of learning assistance required, numbers requiring each kind of assistance, otherwise they cannot plan properly.\u00a0 They likely also need to know specifics about reading levels, vocabulary, literacy, numeracy, etc. \u00a0 Results may indicate some areas requiring attention or extra resources.\u00a0 They may show weaknesses in some schools at certain levels within the system.\u00a0 While...",
