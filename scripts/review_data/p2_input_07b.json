Don argues that the practice of social promotion prevents meaningful comparison of skill levels across institutions and inhibits employers' ability to evaluate applicants effectively. The solution involves creating a mathematical ladder (comparable to music or skating certification levels) with independently assessed achievement levels. The ladder would establish common standards, aid labor mobility, and reduce curriculum development workload. Why math specifically: it has identifiable structure (numeracy through infinite series) but lacks widely accepted competency analyses and level agreements.",

The committee established that the math gap is real and has severe economic consequences: reduced quality of life, lower productivity, higher unemployment, lower product quality, reduced wages, and poor customer service. Root causes identified include differing perceptions of institutional roles, silo mentalities, problematic curriculum development models, and education politicization. The proposal establishes an independent assessment service certifying proficiency in everyday mathematics skills.

It emphasizes that learning is fundamentally a process of discovery, critique of traditional classroom lecture-based learning as inefficient, and the importance of curiosity as essential to effective learning. The author argues that learners need freedom to ask questions, time for reflection and exploration, sufficient leisure to think, open-mindedness to the unexpected, and a stress-free environment. References to two blogs: \"Slow Leadership\" and \"The Coyote Within.\" The piece advocates for creating conditions where exploration and self-directed learning can flourish, particularly relevant for adult self-development and professional growth.",

Glendenning documents that PEI's education mission \"captures neither the spirit, breadth, significance nor urgency of the education task.\" He identifies systemic problems: the department operates in \"public instruction\" mode rather than educational development, lacks engagement with 21st-century competencies, ignores soft skills, and shows no interest in broader Islander education. His conclusion: PEI's government is unclear about what it aims to accomplish through education. He proposes a new mission: \"Help Islanders develop knowledge, skills and other attributes needed for life in 21st century\" and recommends mission statement development as a valuable staff development activity.",

Statistics Canada data show teacher salaries lag comparable professions. Don argues the grid system reflects what teachers know, not what they do, perpetuating low compensation.
