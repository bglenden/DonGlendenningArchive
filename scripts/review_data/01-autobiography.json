  "summary": "Don's introduction to his \"About Education\" project, establishing that while families and individuals bear primary responsibility for education, the topic is important and complex enough to warrant professional expertise and societal support. This philosophical statement reflects his career-long conviction that education requires systematic attention and informed leadership.",

Governments help, especially with education for the\nyoung, for two reasons, (1) to encourage and support citizens to\ndevelop their personal capabilities and (2) to ensure that our\ncommunities have the people needed to sustain themselves\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt\nis important, I believe, to have a simple framework for making\ndecisions. the notes that follow describe mine.

  "summary": "This extensive document (spanning ~5800 words) provides comprehensive history of Black River as Don recalls it. Coverage includes the physical geography of the river, early settlement by United Empire Loyalists and Scottish settlers post-1776, the progression from forestry to farming, and economic activities including shipbuilding, lumber, and fishing. Don documents place names (Upper Black River, Middle Black River, Little Branch, Fowlie's Mill, McKenzie Settlement), major institutions (four schools, two churches, community hall), the mill economy (Fowlie's gristmill and sawmill, John W. MacNaughton's operation), and the impact of WWII on community stability. He includes personal economic data from his brother Walter's 1947-48 record book showing butter prices (45 cents/lb), egg prices (30 cents/dozen), and woodcutting/threshing crew practices. The document captures Don's detailed knowledge of community infrastructure and traditional rural life before modernization.",
  "content_preview": "THE COMMUNITY OF BLACK RIVER IN 1939\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough these notes focus on the community in 1939, a bit of background may be in order.\n\n\n\n\nThe Black River\n\n\n\n\nThe Black River is about 7 miles south of Chatham, New Brunswick and, like most rivers in Eastern New Brunswick, flows from west to east eventually emptying from the south into Bay du Vin which is part of the Miramichi River estuary.\u00a0 Black River is thought to have received its name xxx.\u00a0 The Eastern boundary of the Black River was the Victoria Bridge near its mouth although technically the river extends beyond the bridge before melding with the waters of the Bay du Vin.\u00a0 The Black River has many tributaries the largest being the Little Black River, better known as Little Branch. Which joins the Black River near its mouth. \u00a0\n\n\n\n\nThe Black River area was, and to a large extent still is, heavily forested with black, red and white spruce and balsam fir, some pine, white and yellow birch, maple, beech with a scattering of ash, xx.\u00a0 While the forests were and continue to be significant, Black River began to switch from forestry to farming earlier than some of its neighbouring communities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA Brief History\n\n\n\n\nAlthough land had been granted along the shores from Hexham east, settlement of the Black river only occurred after the turn of the century and by 1850 settlers could be found as far west as the Meadows near the headwaters of the river. \u00a0\n\n\n\n\nThe first settlers were United Empire Loyalists who, after the American Revolution of 1776, sailed north along the New England coast and, for the most part, entered the Bay of Fundy landing at Saint John, New Brunswick.\u00a0 Many moved up the Saint John River with some crossing to the east coast via the upper reaches of the Miramichi; others came directly to the Miramichi.\u00a0 \u00a0 Loyalists were soon followed by settlers from the old country - most were Scottish and Presbyterian.\u00a0 After six to eight weeks on the ocean, they set foot in the New World.\u00a0 Some after an initial se...",

  "summary": "A detailed autobiographical narrative covering Don's 1969 decision to move to Prince Edward Island. Describes his departure from Ottawa's Training Branch (1962-1968) due to restructuring and loss of collegiality, his interview process for a Nanaimo community college presidency, and his deliberate choice to decline British Columbia in favor of PEI after an unsatisfactory conditional job offer. Demonstrates his character: intellectual rigor (organizational theory from Indiana), respect for organizational culture, and principled decision-making.

  "summary": "A thought-piece dated July 24, 2004, in which Don challenges the common conflation of education with schooling. Drawing on Good's Dictionary and quotations from George Bernard Shaw and Bud MacDougall, Don argues that education encompasses learning from home, church, peers, travel, and community\u2014not just formal schooling. He critiques schools for narrowly focusing on academic disciplines and advocates for including teamwork, problem-solving, and life skills in educational transcripts and student evaluation.",

  "summary": "Don recounts observing a handyman's consistent, self-directed, quality work and wonders why schools don't develop similar practical rating scales for employment-bound students and vocational learners. He advocates for rating scales with five or six competency levels that focus on practical attributes (speed, accuracy, initiative, safety, quality) rather than abstract grades. This approach, he argues, enables self-assessment discussion and strengthens soft skills and personal attributes. He also notes Ontario's 2020 math curriculum redesign incorporating financial literacy and coding, suggesting this reflects growing recognition that math education must connect to real-world application.",

My father was involved in its construction; my Mother was an active member, siblings played a variety of roles and nephews and nieces are keeping up the tradition. I might also add that many summer Ministers boarded at our home and shared meals and events with our family; their presence was one of my connections to the world beyond Black River.\n\nSunday services were held at 11.00 am one week and 7:00 pm the next; the change allowed the minister to travel to and from Kouchibouguac9 (awo-point charge) where the schedule was reversed. After a morning service, the Minister travelled to Kouchibouguac\u00a0 where he preached the evening service and stayed the following week. In those days, Ministers, did not have their own vehicle; transportation to the other site was provided by members of St.Paul\u2019s.\u00a0 One summer minister, as I recall, had a bicycle to travel back and forth.\u00a0\n\nMy church experiences were positive; St. Paul\u2019s was a welcoming church.

The latest descendant to visit Callister Hall is Joy\n\tAyer, a GGGranddaughter of John Glendinning.  Joy visited on a day\n\tthat new owners, by the name of Domoney, were moving in.  Joy has\n\tkept in touch and sent me a copy of a recent letter from the new\n\tresidents.  It reads as follows:\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\nI\n\tfelt, as it is now a year since we purchased Callisterhall and nine\n\tmonths sinced we moved in, that I would inform you of our progress.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\nWe\n\tabsolutely love it here and cannot believe how the community has\n\tembraced us.  Many people have said, on visiting, that it has a\n\tspiritual feel about the place.  \n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n \n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n \n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n \n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\nWe\n\thave spent last summer working outdoors and we are still half\n\tunpacked indoors, due to the lack of space, but we are now in the\n\tprocess of having a barn built  in the field next to the cottage so\n\twe can then \"expand\" into it.  The fields will then be\n\tsprayed then ploughed and re-seeded.  \n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\nThen\n\tI can start with my animals.  We had 27 sheep from a local farmer\n\tjust to graze the grass but we hope to have our own soon.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\nI\n\twould love to know more about Callisterhall as I am sure it has a\n\tlot to tell.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\nWe\n\thave just bought a cage to put a puppy in (indoors) so that is\n\tsomething to look forward to.  It will be nice to be able to shut it\n\taway safely when needed.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\nI\n\tstill feel awful that I didn't have the time to give to you when you\n\tcalled in but as you can imagine, things were \"fraught\". \n\tPlease feel fr...",

(Recorded in vol. 105, No.18287)\n\n\n\n\nThis is located in an area known as the Meadows - a name that has long since disappeared.\u00a0 This, I believe, is Jubal 3 who married Grace MacDonald.\u00a0 Jubal and Grace moved to Little Branch, in 1900 or 1901 to the place where Neil Watling now lives. \u00a0\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the New Brunswick Land Grants Index, neighbours in the Meadows starting at Route 11 were:\n\n\n\n\nLot Grantee \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Acres\u00a0 \u00a0 Date Granted\n\n\n\n\n26 \u00a0 Terrence Cook\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 150 Ac.\u00a0 \t1833-07-24\n\n27 \u00a0 Patrick Smith \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 112 Ac \t1838-12-21\n\n28 \u00a0 Richard Hutchison 100 Ac \t1849-06-04\n\n29 \u00a0 Gardiner Archibald\u00a0 98 Ac \t1880-05-10\n\n30 \u00a0 Jubal Watling, Jr \u00a0 100 Ac\u00a0 \u00a0 1881-04-20\n\n31 \u00a0 Donald Cameron \u00a0 100 Ac \t1854-01-30\n\n33 \u00a0 Unknown\n\n34 \u00a0 Donald McBeath \u00a0 \t1883-03-09\n\n\n\n\nI believe there was a road to the Meadows along the south side of the Black River starting at Route 11.
