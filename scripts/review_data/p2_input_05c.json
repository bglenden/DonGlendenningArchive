While sympathetic to teaching constraints, he lists alternatives: let student struggle, recommend post-graduation upgrading, provide extra instruction, transfer to lower level, or recommend tutoring. Options 3 and 5 keep doors open, but cost barriers and school culture favor option 4, creating barriers to post-secondary transition, reducing college likelihood, harming employment prospects, and potentially lowering lifetime income. He emphasizes this contradicts educational philosophy about developing full capacity.",

  "summary": "Glendenning questions testing's purposes and appropriate audience. Testing serves diagnostic (establishing performance levels) and sorting (ranking learners) functions. He argues that learners, teachers, and parents need diagnostic information for instructional improvement, while planners need aggregate data about learner populations needing different support levels. However, he questions whether schools should sort learners, arguing that unlike races where ranking matters, educational success is potentially universal. He contends schools should test to improve instruction but not to publicize individual rankings, suggesting that sorting wastes instructional time while providing no learning benefit.",

  "summary": "A letter from 2018 (included in 2023 file collection, indicating Don's archival organization) framing education system structure as a \"puzzler\" (things he doesn't understand). Don observes that most PEI government departments structure by field/branch: Agriculture (land, crops, potatoes), Health (COVID, drugs, e-health, hospitals), Fisheries (fishing, hunting, wildlife, trapping). Education, however, organizes by study levels (elementary, secondary, postsecondary), a notably different structural criterion. Don proposes alternative organizing principles: essential/occupational skills (welding, arts, science, technology), or life roles (citizen, individual, family member, student, producer, consumer). He uses a culinary metaphor\u2014focus on the menu (educational services) rather than the dining room (schools)\u2014suggesting that top leadership in Department and schools should focus on educational services, not school operation.
