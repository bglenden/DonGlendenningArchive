Although\nPEI math scores on National and international tests have risen,\nfriends tell me that math has not improved on the shop floor; I\u2019ve\nbeen wondering why.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI\u2019ve\nbeen looking around and may have found the answer.  Islanders need\nmath, most of us, citizens, for example, don\u2019t need a  high level. \nBut we all need to be able to measure, sort, calculate, group and\nestimate numbers, space, time  distance, etc,  and they need to do it\nquickly, easily, accurately; and consistently; This is known as\nnumeracy and it being adopted elsewhere; a copy of my notes are\nattached,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut\nI\u2019d like to do more, I\u2019d like to make an analysis of math skills\nused by Islanders. It involves bringing together a small group for a\ntwo- day of brainstorming session.   It\u2019s a proven technique, we\nused it regularly but apparently there is no one on PEI now with the\nexpertise.  I\u2019ll have to bring someone in at a cost $15,000.   \n(See enclosed description) I\u2019m wondering if you could help with the\ncost.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI\nopened a fund at the Community Foundation, 121 Queen Street,\nCharlottetown, PE, C1A 4B3; the Foundation will provide  charitable\nreceipts for contributions. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI\u2019ll\nappreciate any help you can give and would be happy to explain\nfurther and answer any questions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks\nin advance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSincerely,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDon\nGlendenning",

  "summary": "A November 30, 2014 solicitation letter from Don Glendenning to Roger Birt seeking support for a numeracy education research project. Don identifies a gap in PEI's math education: although test scores have improved, workers lack practical numeracy skills. He frames numeracy (quick, accurate application of mathematical knowledge) as a solution and proposes funding a $15,000 analysis of math skills used by Islanders. The letter reveals Don's sophisticated understanding of educational assessment, his willingness to bring in external expertise when needed, and his ability to identify specific, measurable problems and propose data-driven solutions. This correspondence exemplifies his role as an educational innovator and leader.",

I\u2019ve enclosed what\nI\u2019ve learned so far.\n\n\nBut I\u2019d\nlike to examine it more closely.
