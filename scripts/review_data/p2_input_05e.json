  "summary": "(170 words):**\nDon Glendenning defines learning, teaching, and education with clarity and precision. He argues all PEI residents are potential learners who seek measurable change in knowledge, skills, attitudes, or values. Learners bring three elements to education: inherent physical/mental/emotional conditions; prior experiences from varied sources; and personal aspirations. Don defines learning as changing what one knows, feels, believes, and can do; teaching as arranging experiences enabling such change; and education as resulting from meaningful experiences. He notes that being \"well-educated\" means handling everyday life issues competently. Critically, Don rejects the conflation of school attendance with education\u2014the World Bank warns this is problematic. He observes PEI educators lack shared definitions, potentially reflecting mission uncertainty, struggles with contemporary changes, and unclear educational services. He recommends reviewing common terminology, adopting shared definitions, implementing low-key systemic changes, ensuring conceptual clarity, and reconsidering educational goals and lifelong learning integration.",

He notes that departmental literature references \"creating opportunities for student success,\" \"securing a place in society,\" and \"developing high quality programs,\" but argues these statements lack sufficient specificity for program design or results measurement. Don proposes that education's purpose is helping people gain knowledge, skills, attitudes, and attributes for various life roles (citizen, family member, individual, student, consumer, producer), with citizen and employment contexts most frequently mentioned by Islanders. A clear purpose, Don argues, would direct organizational structure and provide focus for instruction and assessment, shifting teacher work from subject/grade delivery to enabling students' life role competence. He calls this \"purpose firm\" (quoting a Sunday School teacher) and urgently needed.",

Glendenning emphasizes that OECD and UNICEF quality recommendations\u2014though low-cost\u2014are largely ignored. Notes institutional reforms occurring elsewhere: rethinking high-stakes testing, introducing continuous progress, replacing school grades with achievement levels, establishing external assessment bodies, and recognizing school autonomy and accountability as improvement drivers.
