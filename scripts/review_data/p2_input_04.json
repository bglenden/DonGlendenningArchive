Don defines governance as \"who makes what decisions, and in what manner.\" He identifies underlying confusions between education/schooling and credentials/qualifications. The paper extensively documents that research shows direct relationship between school autonomy and student performance (citing OECD PISA data). Don emphasizes teachers should serve as \"educational family doctors\" with accountability for learner outcomes. He proposes clear decision-making assignments: learners/parents select schools and programs, teachers make professional decisions for assigned learners, principals focus on instructional leadership, trustees/superintendents operate schools, Deputy Ministers ensure quality education for all Islanders. Includes detailed Albertan school board decision examples and PEI trustee responsibilities. Advocates for immediate changes: consolidate educational responsibilities, delegate administrative decisions, clarify principal roles, assign student decisions to teachers, establish independent qualification authority. Later \"Thoughts on School Governance\" section dated May 25, 2012 emphasizes governance model could remove change barriers when combined with professional freedom and accountability.

Don reflects that while interesting then, schools without walls are now more feasible given internet information access, competency-based education, performance assessment, computers, and individual learner management systems. He proposes two implementation scenarios: apprenticeship programs using competency analyses with learning managers (unlike teachers, more akin to physicians) who identify needs, create learning plans, secure opportunities, and provide feedback.

Second, Don discusses Prior Learning Assessment (PLA), emphasizing it should be integrated into ongoing teaching rather than treated as separate gatekeeping.

Third, he proposes a \"Record of Achievement\" as an alternative to traditional transcripts\u2014a comprehensive document recording significant skills, knowledge, and attitudes demonstrated throughout schooling, addressing employer expectations beyond university entrance requirements.

  "summary": "(152 words):** Don analyzes technician/technologist distinctions, rejecting institutional definitions based on program length. Using Bell's laboratory evolution, he illustrates workplace progression: laborers/craftsmen provide basic assistance; technicians apply established technical knowledge within standard procedures; technologists extend technical boundaries; engineers originate concepts. Don emphasizes technicians require advanced science/mathematics knowledge and diagnostic abilities, not necessarily manual skill (varying by specialty). Technologists require broader knowledge spanning traditional engineering, business, and medical fields. Don critiques educational confusion regarding terminology, noting institutions award conflicting designations. He emphasizes occupational practice defines roles better than institutional credentials. Don's framework influenced Holland College's positioning of applied technology education grounded in workplace practice rather than institutional designation. His distinction clarifies that role definition flows from occupational requirements, not arbitrary institutional categories.",

Current documents fail describing achievement meaningfully, emphasizing narrow subject matter while ignoring non-academic competencies important to employers and institutions. Records would document: discipline accomplishments, communication abilities, responsibility assumption, collaborative skills, technological awareness, work habits\u2014describing demonstrated strengths rather than listing activities. Records would show growth throughout schooling and ideally extend to lifelong learning. Don acknowledges structural barriers: colleges/universities (serving only 30-35% of students) may resist; employers welcome them; supervisors understand them; personnel officers resist information complexity. The idea isn't new but deserves reconsideration.

Schooling-education distinction emphasizes that schools contribute to but don't monopolize education; homes, communities, peers educate as well. Current conflation discourages lifelong learning and non-school learning recognition. Vocational education definition derives from learner purpose, not content: same course becomes vocational or academic based on employment intent. Cultural divide essay identifies school-work disconnects\u2014task-switching regardless of completion, teacher-dependence, absent service mentality, outdated industrial structures, minimal student responsibility. Don proposes cultural, not curricular, solutions: individual focus, output emphasis, achievement measurement, teacher accountability, learning plans, skills emphasis, community standards. Holland College founding reflections defend the separate college approach, emphasizing quality over university-transfer convenience. His teaching principle\u2014\"If the learner hasn't learned, the teacher hasn't taught\"\u2014recognizes learning as individual responsibility while placing accountability on teachers. Continuous intake advocacy proposes flexible enrollment matching hospital practice: instructional time becomes variable while achievement standards remain constant.
