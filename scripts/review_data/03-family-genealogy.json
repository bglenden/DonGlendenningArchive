Although her name was Jane, Dad always called her Jean;\nthis may account for the fact that the Watling side of the family\ncontinued to call her Jane (or Janie as Uncle Ern called her) while\nthe Glendenning side of the family referred to her as Jean.  I\nremember Mum saying that Dad referred to her as \"Jeannie with\nthe light brown hair\".  St. Stephen's Presbyterian Church (now\nUnited Church) shows her name as Jane.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJane was the second youngest of a\nfamily of eight born to Jubal Watling and Grace MacAskill MacDonald. \n She was named after Jane Elizabeth Jardine who married Donald\nCameron (Cameron Russell\u2019s grandmother)  A few years ago when\nvisiting Francis and Phyllis MacNaughton in Vancouver, Phyllis showed\na framed, handmade embroidery (?) made by Jane Elizabeth Jardine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen Mum was about 10 years old, the\nfamily moved from the Meadows to the Branch.  We know that she went\nto school in Upper Black River; it is unlikely that she went or went\nfor very long to the school at the Branch.  I remember Mum saying\nthat her mother would take her from school to help Aunt Elspie\nMacNaughton who had a young and growing family and needed help.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPortland, Maine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJane Watling arrived in Portland on\nJanuary 24, 1908 just prior to her 18th birthday.

One might assume that the family moved\nat latest during the summer so that the children, at least Walter and\nGrace, could enrol in the Little Branch School by September.

The western property\nline, starting at the Little Branch School, forms the back property\nline for many of the properties along Black River.  The rear of the\nproperty was known as Jessie's Corner - probably at the rear of\neither the Godfrey or Gibson property.

The looming war\nresulted in the construction of an airbase at Chatham, a radar\nstation at St. Margaret\u2019s, and a bombing range on the road to\nLoggieville.  These developments meant a significant growth of\nnon-farm jobs for the community.  The outbreak of hostilities also\nsoon resulted in sons, sons-in-law, neighbours, relatives and friends\nentering the armed forces.

At one time, the community of Black River\nappears to have extended as far east as Bayside (Miramichi) and\nperhaps as far as the Bay due Vin River.  The mouth of the Black\nRiver, around what I knew as the Victoria Bridge and Hexham area, was\nsettled before 1800; most if not all the land around the Little\nBranch River, except for the Fowlie Grant, and along the south side\nof the Black River as far as St. Paul\u2019s Presbyterian Church, was\ngranted on June 3, 1812.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe\nearliest settlers in the Black River as we know it today were United\nEmpire Loyalists and Highland Scots; some had settled initially along\nthe Saint John River, moved north to the Nashwaak and eventually\nrelocated to the Miramichi.  Settlers in Bay du Vin tended to be\nEnglish and followers of the Church of England with Black River being\nScottish and Presbyterian.  From MacDougall\u2019s book we learn that\nLoyalists included Major James Macdonald, Farquahar MacRae, Angus\nMacDonald, Neil MacGraw, Dougald Campbell, James Gunn, Gregor\nMcKinnnon, Donald MacVicar, John Bailey Williston, Rev.

However, in this case, I believe that I may have figured out who the Alexander who married Mary Ann Lopeman was. The Census of 1881 shows Alex Sr.(26), Mary Ann (23), and two children: Mary M. (3) and William (2m). Alex Jr. was born later, as we know. The family does not appear in the 1891 census.\n\n\u00a0\n\nIt seems that this Alex Sr. fits the age description for Alexander, a son of William Watling and Mary MacNaughton. Alex (Wm) was 6 in 1851, 15 in 1871, and no longer at home in 1881. The Alex in question is the only Alex Watling in the county in the 1881 census. Let me know if you have other information as to the spouse/progeny of William and Mary's Alex. If not, I don't know where else this Alex Sr. would have come from.

However, now that winter seems to be setting in in earnest, this would be a good time to get back to my research.\n\n\n\n\nReading through Don's notes has reminded me that Mary Anne Harley Henry indicated in her 99th birthday interview that she had two brothers and three sisters. Even if we find conclusive evidence that Elizabeth and Margaret were her sisters, we are still missing another sister. If my calculations are correct the one that died on her 94th birthday is not accounted for.\n\n\n\n\nThe Harley family members of Miramichi seemed to have been fairly prominent. Therefore, I wonder why the local papers transcribed by Daniel Johnson, didn't give any coverage to the death of Ann Bidders Harley. Perhaps her death predated some of the newspapers. In Ireland I saw a volume of Coshe Mang that listed a marriage for an Ann Bidders at about the right time frame but it was to a Denis Harley. I am hoping that one of the Toronto libraries will have copies of the Coshe Mang volumes so I can explore further.\n\n\n\n\nBy one of those strange quirks, I worked in the early 70's with a colleague who is a direct descendant of the William Harley who moved to Upper Canada from Miramichi. One of her relatives (also named William Harley) has compiled a family history in which he suggests a relationship to the Harley's of Harley Street in London.\n\n\n\n\nIncidentally, if anyone has a current contact for Robert Stevens, I would appreciate getting in touch with him.

Frank moved there in 1898 and Elmer by 1901. Venetia, the oldest child, seems to have played the role of \"host\" as each new family member moved south.\u00a0 Venetia lived in Falmouth Foreside which is between Portland and Freeport.\u00a0 Other siblings known to have lived in Portland, at least for a while, include Margaret, Raymond and Guy. \u00a0 In addition, Maude and her husband, Jim Cormie...",

On her first trip, she traveled with Mrs. F. A. Fowlie and Ernest MacLean who were going to Lowell, Mass to visit relatives.\u00a0 She may have she stayed for a while with Dad\u2019s cousin, Sam Knowles.\u00a0 At one time she lived at 1595 Beacon Street, Beverley, Mass. She frequently visited her Uncle Jack Watling in Boston and later when he lived on Swan\u2019s Island near Eastport, Maine.\u00a0 Grace returned regularly to Little Branch for the summer coming sometimes by steamer from Boston to Saint John, NB.\u00a0 (I believe that the fare to Saint John was $10.00)\u00a0 In 1947, when I left home for Teachers\u2019 College in Fredericton, I inherited Grace\u2019s steamer trunk \u2013 and it carried my belongings on a number of later trips.\n\n\n\n\nAs a young woman in Little Branch and later in Boston, Grace loved to square dance;...",

Following the publication of this information in Family Chronicle No. 28, however, I received the following Email from\u00a0 Thomas Holme:\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\"There were no McNaughtons living in Dunderave castle after around 1720. Your website states that Malcolm's son John was born in Dunderave castle July 24, 1774. But the MacNaughtons lost the castle and all their lands in the first decade of the 1700s. By 1711 they final paperwork was finished and Dunderave no longer belonged to them. Dunderave belonged to the family of Campbel of Ardkinglas that lived across Loch Fyne from the MacNauchtans.

Travelling east from Bathurst along the coast towards\nCaraquet, one finds a number of communities familiar to the\nGlendenning family.  Most relevant are the following as described in\nthe Geographical Names of New Brunswick, 1875:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\nBathurst,\n\toriginally named St. Peters in 1671, was named for the Third Earl of\n\tBathurst in 1826. \n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\nSalmon\n\tBeach\n\twas settled around 1820 by immigrants from Ireland and included the\n\tdistricts of Prospect Hill, Strawberry Plain and Mount Pleasant.  \n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\nJaneville\n\twas named for Jane Dawson, wife of Benjamin Dawson who settled there\n\tabout 1835.  \n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\nStonehaven\n\twas probably named for Stonehaven, Scotland. \n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\nNew\n\tBandon\n\twas settled in 1819 by several families from Bandon, Ireland.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\nCanobie\n\tnamed  after Canonbie, Dumfriesshire, Scotland.  \t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording\nto  Pioneer Settlers of the Bay Chaleur, settlement on the coast east\nof Bathurst took place by the Acadians in the latter half of the\n1700s and, although living on the land, they grants were not given\ntheir grants until 1812.  Apparently, an organized system of granting\nof land did not evolve until the 1800s and even then there could be\ndelays of a decade or more between petitioning land and receiving\nland.  Even then, a grant was not final until at least five acres had\nbeen cleared.  The first registered land grants in the area were made\nto James Sutherland and his brother Hugh, and to Richard Nevison in\n1789.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce\nsettled, men began the task of clearing land and erecting a house and\nbarn.  Trees not needed were stacked, dried and burned.  Few oxen or\nhorses were available so the land was broken and cultivated with the\naid of a hoe.  The initial crops were planted between the stumps,\nwhich, over time, rotted and were ...",

Many came directly from\nScotland while others are thought to have come to the Miramichi via\nCape Breton, Prince Edward Island, or other Maritime ports.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe\nBlack River flows from west to east and empties into Bay du Vin,\nwhich is part of the Miramichi River.

I picked up on a couple of differences that I'll mention :\n\n- You named 11 children for Alex and Catherine - actually ,there were 12 . The 12th child was Jane Mclean Watling (1879-1881) .She died in 1881 along with 2 of her siblings, Albert and Peter (1 from each set of twins) all within weeks of each other. There was some sort of epidemic - possibly scarlet fever.\n\n- You list a Rodney Watling as a child of John Gordon Watling and Myrtle May Dempsey (my grandparents). I don't know who he is, but he certainly isn't one of my fathers siblings!\n\n- You have Peter Watling (child of Alex & Catherine) as having died in 1947 and leaving 2 children.  As I mentionned above ,Peter died 1n 1881.  The 1947 death date and 2 children actually belong to James Petrie Watling which you have right later in your file.\n\nUnfortunately ,I don't know Emily/Emmas wedding date -like you ,I only know her husbands name, William Eddy. I do have them listed as having a child named Amos. Were you aware of him ?\n\nHope this info and descendant file is of help to you - please don't hesitate to contact me if you'd like further information or pictures.\n\n\nJudy Watling\u0000",

Godfrey and they continued to live in Back River about 3-4 miles from the family home..\n\n\n\n\nJane Watling went to Portland in 1908 and married Elmer Glendenning on October 10, 1910 and lived and worked in the USA.\u00a0 In 1914 they returned to NB and bought the property directly across the road from the old family home departing for the USA again in late 1916. \u00a0\n\n\n\n\nErnest Watling was probably living at home when he enlisted.\n\n\n\n\nAll of the above would have been aunts and uncles to Jimmie.\n\n\n\n\nArchie MacNaughton (1896-1944)...",

The first registered land grant was to James Sutherland\nand his brother Hugh, and Richard Nevison in 1789.  \nApparently,\nan organized system of granting of land did not evolve until the\n1800s and even then there could be delays of a decade or more between\npetitioning for land and receiving it.  Even then, the grant was not\nfinal until at least five acres had been cleared.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce\nsettled, men began the task of clearing land and erecting a dwelling\nand barn.

According to both Walter and\nLillian, the car was purchased on the day that Annie MacDougall died.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWalter worked with Dad cutting wood up Bay du Vin River to earn money\nto buy one of the cars; I cannot recall which one.  Shown above are\nthe 1928 registrations for the Model T Ford and in 1938 for the Model\nA. Ford  Thanks to Lillian (Glendenning) Murray for access to the\noriginal documents.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe gas tank for the Model A, and perhaps for the Model T, was just\nin front of the windshield and gas flowed by gravity to the engine. \nOn very steep hills, the Tabisintac for example, the car had to be\nturned around and driven backward up the hill.  .  Dad upset the\nModel T at Gilberts Corner, near Shediac, the day he brought Grace\nhome from business college.  The Model A sat in the old wagon shed,\npresumably because of the recession.   Walter said that Dad allowed\n$2.00 worth of gas each week but I do not recall for what year.  Gas\npumps of the day were pumped by hand to fill a chamber at the top of\nthe pump.  The gas then flowed by gravity through the hose to the gas\ntank on a car.",

  "summary": "Written by Donald Edge (NOT Don Glendenning; received as email correspondence Feb 2003), this witty and detailed essay describes life in Black River using outdoor privies and chamber pots, drawing from childhood memories and observations. References Don's Watling cousins and their remarkably modern indoor privy within their barn complex. A valuable resource for understanding the material conditions of early 20th-century Black River life and provides context for Don's own childhood experiences in that community. Edge's piece reflects on outhouses as \"hallmarks of democracy\" and symbols of self-reliance.",

After Abrams died he became the master builder at Joseph Russell's yard on Beaubear's Island.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 1850, after Russell had given up his shipyard and lumber business in order to move to Utah, John Harley and George Burchill bought it for a fraction of its true value. During tbe next seven years they conducted woods operations, ran a sawmill, and built nine ships, all of whicb were sold in Britain. After their partnership was dissolved in 1857, Harley continued to build ships on the island with the help of his sons. In all, be is credited with having built sixty-two ships on the Miramichi, the last two in 1866. At around this time he lost the island to the Commercial Bank, to which it had been mortgaged some years previously.

A John Watling appears in the 1851 NB Census. That census\u00a0\n\nshows him in Napan, an immigrant of 1845 and the husband of Jessie (Carruthers). Perhaps our John\u00a0\n\nstayed in England for some years before he immigrated to Canada. Some members of the family believe\u00a0\n\nthis to be true.

Jessie was the daughter of James Sr. and Jane\u00a0\n\nCarruthers.\n\n\u00a0- In the 1851 Census, John is listed with his wife Jessie in Napan, with a 1 year old daughter, Janet N.\u00a0\n\nWatling.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0- In the 1861 Census, John and Jessie are listed in the Parish of Newcastle with: Jennet (aged 11),\u00a0\n\nRobert (aged 8), Susan J.

Also, a 16 year old Jennet Edge (presumably\u00a0\n\nof the Black River Edges), was their servant.\n\n\u00a0- In the 1865-66 and 1867-68 Hutchison Directories, John is listed as living on McCallum St. in\u00a0\n\nNewcastle, a mason by trade. He does not appear in the 1871 Lovell Directory.\n\n\u00a0- Neither John nor Jessie appears in the 1871 Census. However, Robert , Jennet, and a William appear\u00a0\n\nin Newcastle.

I believe they were so drunk, they upset the car twice before they got to St. Margarets. The last time they turned it in the ditch. The police took possession fo the car. The owner was a man from St. John, Provincial salesman for the Irving Oil Co., and a young chap from Newcastle, who was getting a ride to St. John.

August 1877 had served in WWI.  However, my husband's grandfather was a William Adams b. Jan 1896 - I believe he served in WWI as he met his wife during this war when he was in England (wife's obituary below).  Given that WWI was circa 1914 - 1919, this would make the William Adams b. 1877 about 40 years old whereas William Adams b. 1896 would have been in his early 20's - a more likely age for military service.

Annie was presented an award in recognition of her valuable services rendered during the War 1914-1919 for her involvement in the British Red Cross Society.  Her involvement continued in Canada as the church group knitted sweaters and socks, etc. for soldiers who needed a home away from home.  She was an active member of St. Andrew's United Church.  During her years of good health, she looked forward to their annual vacations to the East and West coasts.  She enjoyed the outdoors especially her yard and garden.

All five children (2 boys and 3 girls) came to New Brunswick\nin the 1820\u2019s; one daughter, Margaret (1803-1895), married John\nGlendinning in 1833 settling first at Salmon Beach and later in\nCanobie.  (The change from Glendinning to Glendenning came, I\nbelieve, with the granting of lots to John and Walter Glendenning\nabout 1856).   Pioneer Settlers,\na history of Canobie, tells us that early settlers had sheep,  spun\ntheir own wool and wove cloth; it also tells us that John Glendinning\nhad one of the first \u201cweaving machines\u201d (looms) in Canobie and\nthe Glendinnings taught many in  the community to weave. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeaving\ninvolves the use of a loom to interlace threads at right angles to\neach other.  The threads running the length of the cloth form the\nwarp; the threads running across the warp are known as the weft.  The\nweft thread is carried back and forth across the warp by a shuttle\nholding a bobbin or on a small rod called a pirn.  Grandma\u2019s\nshuttle measures 12 x 11/8 x7/8, in excellent condition and is made\nof a dark wood believed to be walnut. It has a tapered, \u201cthreaded\u201d\npirn, and a hole through one side for the thread to unravel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe shuttle was brought to Canada from Ireland\nby my Great Grandmother, Margaret (Harley) Glendenning in the\n1820\u2019s.; it may have been given as a gift or may even have been\ngiven to the youngest daughter on leaving the family nest as a family\nheirloom.

My father was involved in its construction; my Mother was an active member, siblings played a variety of roles, nephews and nieces continued the tradition; and is the church whre I was married. . I might also add that many summer Ministers boarded at our home and shared meals and events with our family; their presence was one of my connections to the world beyond Black River.\n\nS Pauls had a tradition o sharing ministers. Sunday services were held at on Sunday orn, afternoon or evening which allow the Miniser to serve Chatham, Sunny Corner and Kouchibouguac as well. \u00a0\n\nMy church experiences were positive; St. Paul\u2019s was a welcoming church.

Chronicles Glendenning family's Portland settlement with siblings' roles and occupations. Extensively documents Elmer and Frank's cartage business (Glendenning Bros. & Co., 24 Hammond Street, ice delivery, general team work). Details Elmer's work progression in woods (Maine/New Hampshire near Skowhegan, Millinocket, Berlin; lumbering with horses; record lumber cut).

The Glendenning and Watling families were no exception. \nI am told three times a day, trains left Prince Edward Island and\nmade connections with trains to the ABoston\nStates.@\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMany\nMaritimers found their first jobs in the woods of Maine and New\nHampshire, initially in winter only.

Around the turn of the century a few grand homes began to\nappear on the Promenade which provided a sweeping view of the water. \nConstruction provided many jobs and it is likely that Dad worked in\nthe construction trade field.

The\nsounding the horses hooves and the iron rims of the waggon added to it. \n\nI remember them gravelling the road - about 1960 or 1961 and the trucks\nhauling across it from McGraw's pit. Bert Mills was hired to drive the\nspikes back down because they worked their way up as the planks flapped.\nBert had very poor eye sight ( might have been legally blind) so he pounded\nspikes - spots of tar - spots of oil, anything darker than the planks. Then\nanother truck would cross and more spikes would rise up. \n\nWalking through at night was interesting. If someone had hidden and jumped\nout at me I'd have been over the side I am sure. It was get your eyes\naccustomed to the dark - focus on that rectangle of lighter sky at the far\nend and try and walk down the centre of the roadway. Those missing boards\nlet in some light so were welcomed. This likely was good training for\ndriving - look far ahead and not at the lines on either side of you. \n\nWe parked in it - drank beer from the boot leggers there because we were too\nyoung to go to the liquor store - etc. \n\nThe first time they closed it - about easter 1969 or 70  I think - they put\nin 2 posts and put a guard rail across them and dumped a load of gravel to\nboot. I got the guard rail off easily with an old crescent wrench but it\ntook me most of Good Friday to shovel enough off that pile of gravel to\ndrive across.  They left it open for quite awhile - we did petitions +n 69\nbut to no available. \n\nEnough of the past. Marion is home from work so I'd better see to feeding\nher. \n\nDick from ...",
