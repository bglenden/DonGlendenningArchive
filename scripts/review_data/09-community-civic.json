Don analyzes multiple math providers (public schools, postsecondary institutions, SkillsPEI, private schools, independent learners) operating without coordination or shared definitions. He argues that transition from secondary to post-secondary education depends on mathematics preparation.

  "summary": "A comprehensive essay identifying gaps and shortcomings in Canada's education system, particularly in PEI. Don critiques the rigidity of outcomes-based education (OBE), lack of school autonomy, absence of student advocates, and disconnection from job qualifications. He proposes five key reforms: updating OBE, increasing school-level autonomy, separate status for early childhood development, family education advisors, and establishing a qualification authority.",

Because of this, Canada is among the world\nleaders in our investment in ensuring that our citizens, especially\nour youth, have access to a variety of educational activities and\nexperiences.  Our education system developed over decades and served\nus well, however, but it is becoming rigid when the world is\ndemanding flexibility.  There is a gap between what Islanders have\nand what they want and Islanders want to play a meaningful role in\nbringing about the desired changes. \n\n\nEducation\nis a lifelong process of engaging in experiences that have a\nformative effect on the way we feel, think and act; this effect is\nusually expressed in terms of a person\u2019s attitudes, skills and\nknowledge.  Major contributors to one\u2019s education include one\u2019s\nself, one\u2019s home and extended family, schools and the community at\nlarge.   Schools play a unique role in the provision of education in\nthat they are the only provider of educational services allowed to\naward credentials, the folded paper, so esteemed by our society.\n\n\nThis paper\n\n\nIn recent months, the writer\nhas re-engaged in education by reading widely, conversing often, and\nwriting occasionally; this paper is the result.  He found  a\nwidespread interest in and understanding of the need for change,\nagreement as to the nature of the desired system, but little\nunderstanding among the public as to how the system works and  how to\nbring about change.  Based on these discussions and the writer\u2019s\nknowledge and experience, the writer is of the view that the changes\nthat will make a difference are unlikely to be put in place without\nsome interventions from outside the system; this paper is presented\nas one small step in the change process.\n\n\nAs a sector, education has\nsome ...",

Drawing on a 2000 UNICEF report, Don defines quality education systems as having healthy, well-nourished, family-supported learners; safe, protective environments with adequate resources; relevant curricula developing literacy, numeracy, and life skills; and trained teachers using child-centered approaches in well-managed settings. The newsletter announces a January 20, 2014 workshop at Stratford Town Hall addressing youth preparedness challenges, referencing the Community Foundation's \"Taking the Pulse of Island Youth\" study.

People may be thinking about furthering their education for many reasons: personal interest, self-development, job change or updating, to help children or grandchildren, to improve job performance, to improve quality of life in the community, and to help attract and retain businesses. Whatever the reason, where does a person or organization turn for information and advice? \u00a0\n\nOn returning home, I Googled \u201cSouris development, Souris business development and Souris education\u201d to see what I could find.\u00a0 I used \u201cdevelopment\u201d as a keyword because educating is a developmental process but I also know that education is an important tool in educational development; I found schools, business development offices, career services and a few other things, but none struck me as being place where I could drop by for help.\u00a0 The need for independent information and advice becomes even more important as we move more deeply into the 21st century\n\nOne solution, of course would be for the Department of Education to appoint\u00a0 an area Coordinator to ensure that the people get the services they deserve; and some day when school boards find favour, to appoint a Board of Education rather than school trustees to ensure that all citizens are served not just youngsters in school\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSincerely,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDon Glendenning\n\nA long-time student of education",

The 30-page document, dated December 2008, defines literacy comprehensively, establishes benchmarks (notably that a Level 3 reader can \"read the daily newspaper and converse with others about items read\"), and presents compelling PEI demographic data showing 30% of adults with very low literacy rates.

The program, funded through the Department of\nWorkforce Development and Higher Learning, is offered on a full and\npart-time basis in eight centres across the Island for who people\nlack high school graduation credits, want to upgrade existing school\nmarks or, for people who are not already high school graduates, to\nobtain the PEI\nHigh School Graduation Certificate for Mature Students.  \n\n\n\nThe\npublic can learn more about the Holland College program  at a\npresentation at the Stratford Town Hall on Wednesday, September 30 at\n4:30 pm.  The presentation will be led by Gerry Seaward, a long time\nadult educator and currently Program Manager of Adult and Community\nEducation, Prince of Wales Campus, Holland College.

MacNutt\nalso noted that the average age of enrolees in PEI adult upgrading\nprograms is declining, especially in the Charlottetown area.

It does this primarily through the building and administering of endowments the income from which is used to support charitable activities.\u00a0 Its establishment has been a success story, and John has been a major contributor to that success.\n\n\n\n\nCFPEI was established in 1993 and, when John joined the Board, had an endowment of perhaps $100,000; today that endowment is more than $10,000,000, Much of its success is attributable to John\u2019s leadership, trust and standing in the community including the direct application of his considerable knowledge of finance and investment. John understands PEI; his insights allow him to see both a community\u2019s needs and a community\u2019s capacity to respond to its needs.\u00a0 Those talents resulted in the growth and maturation of he Community Foundation of Prince Edward Island.\n\n\n\n\nThe Robinson Family is a well-recognized and respected community family; giving back is a family tradition.\u00a0 John and his family are concerned, generous and dedicated to the Island community; it is without any reservation whatsoever, that I support this nomination.\n\n\n\n\nSincerely\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDonald\u00a0 Glendenning, CM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPAGE \u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPAGE\u00a0 1",

Without doubt, education is important, changes are needed, and there is wide support for change both inside and outside the system.\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s not easy to bring about change in any organization, and especially from the outside.\u00a0 But it can and must be done.\u00a0 Consequently, I\u2019ve been working with a small group of Islanders who are of the same mind.\u00a0 As a result, I am much more aware of the level of concern, required changes, and what can and should be done.\u00a0 One major change, for example, is to provide more autonomy and accountability to teachers and principals.\n\n\n\n\nWhile education systems are changing, changes fall short of what is actually required and fail to deal with a number of underlying weaknesses such as autonomy, accountability and engagement.\u00a0 Furthermore, the required changes are not likely to happen unless the public, you and I, demand it. Traditional efforts to bring about change have not worked.\u00a0 Some innovative, perhaps even bold, measures are required, but we think that a better education system is worth it.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nChange is fuelled by information, however, we know that having information itself doesn\u2019t guarantee change.\u00a0 Compared with other services, education falls short in the amount of information available to users and the public.\u00a0 Perhaps the most obvious comparison is with health where the media, on a daily basis it seems, carries items about cancer, diabetes, Alzheimers, the dangers of smoking as well as many other matters relating to our health.\u00a0 We need that kind of attention to matters of education; practi...",

He emphasizes CFPEI's accessibility and volunteer-managed board of PEI-based directors, promoting the foundation's one-percent annual administration fee as unbeatable.

Don features CFPEI President Norman Carruthers explaining how community foundations differ from traditional charities by addressing broad community needs across all sectors. He details CFPEI's impact: a $100,000 Challenge Grant to 50 organizations for capacity building, scholarship programs, and emergency response initiatives. Don emphasizes donors' growing desire to customize donations and the foundation's flexibility in responding to varied charitable interests (literacy, medical emergencies, scholarships, area-specific funds).

So says Norman\n\tCarruthers, President of the Community Foundation of Prince Edward\n\tIsland.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\nMost\n\tcharitable organizations are focused on the needs of a particular\n\tsegment of the community such as health, the local hospital, or the\n\tlocal arts organization.  Community foundations, on the other hand,\n\thave a broad interest in all of the needs of all of the communities\n\tacross the Island whether those needs be in the field of health,\n\teducation, religion, environment, heritage, arts or any other\n\tsector.  In accomplishing their mandate, community foundations\n\tsupport charitable organizations that work in any and all sectors.  \n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\nTo\n\tillustrate the point, under a recent \u201cChallenge Grant\u201d, the\n\tFoundation made grants totaling $100,000 to some 50 PEI charitable\n\torganizations in the area of capacity building.  In addition, the\n\tFoundation offered scholarships and conducted a number of workshops\n\tfor the charitable sector.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\nPerhaps\n\ta greater impact, however, has come from the Foundations ability to\n\trespond to donors\u2019 interests in customizing their donations. \n\tRegardless of the charitable interest, community foundations can\n\tfind ways to respond.  As examples, thanks to the generosity of\n\tdonors, grants are now available to improve the first response\n\tefforts to medical emergencies, to purchase books for Island\n\tschools, to support literacy and to provide scholarships for PEI\n\tstudents who wish to study either on or off the Island.  The Souris\n\tFund is another example of our flexibility in that it provides\n\tgrants for any charitable purpose in the Souris area; the\n\testablishment of a Living Trust is another.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\nIncreasingly,\n\tdonors, especially younger donors, want to be invo...",

Opening with a farmer's parable about persistently moving a stone through repeated effort, Don draws parallels to building personal wealth and community legacies. He contrasts temporary donations with permanent endowments, emphasizing how legacy funds continue supporting causes after donors' deaths. The newsletter encourages people to establish endowments reflecting their interests, describing CFPEI's experience in administering such funds and its commitment to honoring donor intentions over time.

This approach to math is\ncalled numeracy and it involves the application of math to every-day\nlives. Numeracy is being adopted elsewhere; usually in addition to\ntraditional math.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut\nwe need to do more, to begin with we need to identify math skills\nused by Islanders. Making an analysis involves bringing together a\nsmall group for a two- day of brainstorming session.   It\u2019s a\nproven technique, we used it regularly at Holland College but\napparently there is no one on PEI now with the expertise.  We\u2019ll\nhave to bring someone in at a cost $15,000.  The making of an\nanalysis is described in the attached paper.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI\nam wondering if you can help to help cover the cost. Although we are\na charitable organization, we opened an account at The Community\nFoundation, 121 Queen Street, Charlottetown, PE, C1A 4B3; they will\naccept donations on our behalf and issue charitable receipts. \nEnclosed you will find a description of the project, a brochure about\nEducation 20/20 Inc. and some notes about my search\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI\nappreciate your consideration of this request and would be happy to\nexplain further and answer any questions.

Don provides comprehensive background on community foundations, including Canadian history (first founded Winnipeg 1921, now 155 across Canada with $2.7 billion in assets), governance structure, and advantages of establishing funds within CFPEI rather than private foundations. Describes different fund types (undesignated, designated, interest) and their flexibility.

By pooling many individual endowment funds for administration and investment purposes, community foundations are able to minimize the cost of their services and maximize the return on their investments, thus maximizing the amount available for granting.\n\n\n\n\nCommunity foundations, and there are some 170 in Canada today, provide a simple, low cost\u00a0 alternative to making direct disbursements to ...",

Background\n\n\n\n\nLiving memorials are green spaces set aside in memory of a person, place or event; the key characteristic is that it is a natural space and plant life continues to grow. \u00a0 A living memorial may be as simple as a single tree or bush but also may be a garden, a park or a forest. \u00a0\n\n\n\n\nLiving Memorials are more than just a tribute to loved ones; living memorials enhance and beautify our environment, provide shelter for our wildlife, reduce erosion and improve the quality of the air we breathe.\u00a0 Living memorials may bring comfort, hope and peace to visitors and ensure that generations to come will know the beauty of a green plant. \u00a0\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to actual living plants and, depending on the nature of the space , a living memorial may also include comfortable benches on which to rest, a scenic view or viewing platform, path enhancement, footbridges, picnic areas, wildlife areas, handicap accessibility, and erection of shelters. \u00a0\n\n\n\n\n2. Why a living memorial?\n\n\n\n\nPeople usually donate to a Living Memorial to recognize or honour a person, organization or event at a time of a major life change including:\n\n\n\n\na special birthday,\u00a0\n\na retirement,\n\nthe birth of a child,\n\nthe death of a family member, friend or colleague,\n\nrecognition of long and loyal service,\n\nrecognition of outstanding service\n\nthe relocation of a colleague or friend\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.

Education is a key factor in\ndetermining one\u2019s quality of life; in the same way, the collective\neducation of our citizens will determine to a significant degree the\nfuture quality of our community and country. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter\nyears of focusing on the transfer of knowledge deemed to be needed to\nprosper and enjoy life, thanks to technology, schools find that their\nclients have access to the same knowledge as the teacher.

That \u201csomething\u201d could be citizenship,\nemployment, further study or for all three, but it needs to be clear.\n Furthermore, the foundation\nfor skills development lies in the home and the K-12 education system\nand Successful skill development programs require a high level of\ncommunication between all parties involved.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs\nwell as learning in school or college, many people have learned new\nskills on the job. It would help if the new skills were documented. \nAn independent qualification authority was also proposed as a way of\nimproving consistency in grade levels across the Island; it would\nalso be a way of recognizing skills learned on the job, through on\nline courses or even night classes.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther\nideas included offering\nshort technical courses to help young people get their first job\n(three months was suggested) and then providing them with a voucher\nto pay for further training after they get some experience.  Other\nsuggestions included vouchers covering costs of courses on an\nemployee\u2019s own time even at night or on weekends. Traditional\nreport cards lack details about skills and levels learned. One remedy\nis for institutions to follow the lead of PEI Workplace Learning in\ngiving each student a list of competencies on completion of a that\nthey can show to prospective employers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese and other suggestions will be\nforwarded by Education 20/20, host of the evet,  to booth Provincial\nand federal authorities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\t30     -\n\n\nContact:\n\tDon Glendenning\n\n\t\tHome:\n902-892-5859",

  "summary": "Letter from Don Glendenning to Shayne Connolly, President of ADVOCIS (financial advisors), dated June (year not specified but context suggests 2004-2005). Don educates about community foundations as \"new breed\" of charitable organization, community-based rather than cause-based, increasingly chosen as legacy vehicle. Lists seven key reasons to use CFPEIs: continuity, transparency/accountability, low administration fees (1%), professional investment service, principal maintenance, adaptability, and flexibility. Emphasizes CFPEI scholarship flexibility (follows students between institutions, on/off island). Discusses customized granting programs matching donor interests. Positions CFPEI as best vehicle for creating lasting donor legacies. Reflects Don's sophisticated understanding of competitive fundraising landscape and professional relationship development with financial planners.",
