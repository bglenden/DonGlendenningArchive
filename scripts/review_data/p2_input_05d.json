He diagnoses structural problems (narrow role definition, fuzzy vision, coordination gaps, politicized leadership) and proposes solutions including professional service delivery models, learner-centered approaches, and separation of instruction from credentialing. References personal experience in multiple organizations and calls for clear vision statements developed with public input. This piece encapsulates many of his core education reform ideas.",

  "summary": "From July 10, 2014, Don argues schools face a systemic crisis: they focus on knowledge delivery while parents expect educated citizens; institutions matter less; teachers shouldn't award credentials (like coaches vs. referees); public education lacks market forces incentivizing improvement; and time-based progression replaces standards maintenance. He advocates for government ensuring quality education through unbundled service delivery rather than direct school operation. His analysis is systemic: the problem isn't individual schools but the education system's structural misalignment with modern needs.",

He notes that PISA results have replaced community standards, and laments the loss of specific institutions (PVI and PCVH). Don advocates for system review addressing: common definitions glossary, stated program purposes, conceptual clarity, assessment methods, autonomy and accountability definitions, collaboration between providers and users, universal rating scales, informative transcripts, and recognition of learning context importance. He proposes two-stage reform: first, public conversation about education needs and development of vision/principles; second, a delivery plan. The letter calls for locally-led processes with outside specialist assistance, emphasizing that \"everything should be on the table.\" This encapsulates Don's reform methodology: vision before structure.",
