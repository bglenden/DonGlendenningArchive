Don describes his 40+ year research beginning with his Great-Grandfather John Glendinning's family Bible (emigrated Scotland 1830). Provides earliest Glendinning information: John Glendinning born April 2, 1807 at Callister Hall, Scotland, married Margaret Harley August 23, 1833.

I also contracted with the Scottish Ancestry Research Society in Edinburgh, Scotland to do a search.\n\n\n\n\nLater, I distributed a questionnaire to my aunts and uncles on my father=s side of the family.\u00a0 Then there was a long period when I did nothing.\u00a0 During the last decade I re-started the process with attention to my mother=s side.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nMuch of the more recent information was gathered during conversations with family members...",

  "summary": "Eighth Family Chronicle (May 30, 1999) documents Little Branch Post Office history through archival records showing postmasters from 1871-1928, confirming Don's parents Elmer and Jane Glendenning served November 1, 1914 to August 1, 1916. Notes that Aunt Tine MacKenzie likely ran the post office in the Jessie MacDonald house 1902-1907 (between her husbands Tom Adams and John MacKenzie). Information about a separate Watling Post Office (1911-1928). Clarifies the Daly/Daley name change (Carson Daley changed spelling after WWII). Provides detailed genealogy of Aunt Tine's families: children from Tom Adams marriage (James, Jubal Willard, Gertrude) and from John MacKenzie marriage (Norman, Jean, Edith). Corrects earlier error: Alex MacDonald's first wife was Ethel MacTavish (not Catherine McGraw), second wife Beatrice Shuttleworth. Discusses cemetery records and the Alexander MacDonald property division.",

(Where Norman Glendenning now lives).\u00a0 This would be, as I understand it, between 1902 when her first husband, Tom Adams, died and 1907 when she married John MacKenzie\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nI always thought that Dad and Mum ran the Post Office but didn=t have any proof.\u00a0 The above information confirms my understanding.\u00a0 The dates are interesting because we know that Mum and Dad were in Tennessee prior to this (1911 to 1912 or more likely until 1913) The next dates we have are New Haven, Conn. in 1917 where Lillian was born on January 8.\u00a0 It looks as though they may have returned to Little Branch between jobs. \u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWatling Post Office\n\n\n\n\nThere was Post Office named Watling which opened in 1911 and closed in 1928.\u00a0 The Postmasters were Donald Watling, A.

In it, he quotes\n\tThomas Watling, from Dumfries, Scotland, who was transported to\n\tScotland for forging notes on the Bank of Scotland; Watling was a\n\tlandscape painter who arrived in Australia in 1792.   Watling is\n\tquoted a number of times on the barrenness of the country and the\n\tconditions in which people lived.  An internet source speaks of  the\n\t\u201cWatling Collection\u201d of several hundred oil paintings in the\n\tBritish Museum in London.

In addition, James, Grandmother\u2019s\n\tbrother had inherited the farm when his father died, was not\n\tmarried, was living at home but was not able to operate the farm. \n\tAs best I can interpret, the land did not include the Jessie\n\tMcDonald property where Norman Glendenning now lives.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\nOn\n\tNovember 13, 1901, James entered into an agreement with his sister,\n\tGrace and her husband, Jubal.

I\n\tvaguely recall it and others in the family recalled it but not how\n\tit was made.  \n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\nA search\n\tof the internet reveals a number of recipes but they were a version\n\tof French Toast \u2013 usually with cinnamon.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\nAn enquiry\n\tto Margaret Prouse, a regular contributor on food to the\n\tCharlottetown Guardian, brought the following information.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\u201cYankee\n\ttoast was served as a treat at either breakfast or supper.  It was\n\tprepared by combining a \n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\nbit of\n\tpork fat, a good tablespoon of molasses, and about the same amount\n\tof water in a cast iron frying pan.  A slice of bread was dipped in\n\tthe mixture in the frying pan, and then quickly turned over so that\n\tboth sides were coated.  One side was fried until the molasses\n\tcaramelized and then the process was repeated to the other side. \n\tButter could be used instead of pork fat.  \n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\nAnother\n\tapproach is to take a thick slice of bread and butter both sides. \n\tHeat molasses until it bubbles.  Allow bread to cook briefly than\n\tturn over and repeat.  Home made bread is best and preferably a day\n\tor two old;  \u201cstore bought\u201d bread tends to get soggy.\u201d\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\tPoint Aux\n\tQuart\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\nAccording\n\tto the History of Bay du Vin, years ago English ships were chasing\n\tFrench ships in Bay du Vin; the French ships were loaded with wine. \n\tTo prevent capture, the French threw their casks of wine overboard. \n\tThe casks floated to Point aux Carr, which is the French word for\n\tcask.  \n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\tHumphrey\n\tPants\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\nHumphr...",

A year or so\n\tago, Venetia showed me her pass, dated as I recall, 1918.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\nVenetia\n\tattended the Little Branch School for Grades 1-8, the highest grade\n\tavailable in the Little Branch School, and then she \n\t\n\t\nstayed with\n\tAunt Tine in Loggieville where she completed Grade nine.  As was the\n\tcustom of the day, she wrote Entrance Exams and gained First Class\n\tEntrance to \n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\nthe\n\tProvincial Normal School from which she graduated in 1933.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\nI believe\n\tthat she taught in New Carlysle, Napan, Penniac and Bayside; she may\n\talso have taught somewhere north of Fredericton.  She also taught in\n\tPoint Aux Carr, Little Branch, Miramichi Rural High School and\n\tChatham retiring in 1975.  Quite a number of people at her wake\n\tmentioned that Venetia had been their teacher.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\nVenetia was\n\tactive in her church, St. Paul\u2019s Presbyterian.

Aunt Janet had journeyed to Parksville to be with Mum when\n\tGrace was born.  Later Mum and Dad moved up the Ocoee River to Caney\n\tCreek where a second dam was built.

By the end of the\n\tday, his hands would be nearly stuck shut because of the pitch from\n\tthe wood.  When Earl Taylor worked at Fowlies\u2019s mill and stayed at\n\thome, he was also covered with pitch at the end of the day.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\nDonald also\n\tremembered the spruce gum, which was a ball of hardened sap of a\n\tspruce \n\t\n\t\ntree.  It was\n\ta real treat.  Donald still has his fathers spruce gum box.  \n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\nShirley\n\tremembered going to the woods with her uncle, Johnnie MacKay.  On\n\tthe way home, she as allowed to sit on the load of logs.  When her\n\tUncle reached the yard, he had to go under the clothesline to where\n\the was piling the wood.  The clothesline caught Shirley, flipped her\n\tthrough the air into a snow bank.  She survived without injury.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\nAs a\n\tfollow-up to mention of family members in the USA, Tina Newton\n\tthinks that Uncle George worked in both Tennessee and Virginia\n\t(Hampton).  A couple of people mentioned dancing the lancer at the\n\tBlack River Hall.

My recollection is that\n\tWalter went to Grade 6, maybe Grade 7 and then worked with Dad on\n\tthe farm.  Walter did not talk much about his early years but I know\n\tthat he worked long and hard both summer and winter.

Lillian remembered\n\tthat the salesman let Grace tryout the car before Dad bought it. \n\tSometime after 1931 he purchased a 1929  Model A 2-door Sedan \u2013\n\tpurchased, I believe, from the Babineau sisters (The Babineau's\n\toperated the movie theatre in Chatham.)  According to both Walter\n\tand Lillian, the car was purchased on the day that Annie MacDougall\n\tdied. \n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\nWalter\n\tworked with Dad cutting wood up Bay du Vin River to earn money to\n\tbuy one of the cars; I cannot recall which one.  Shown above are the\n\t1928 registrations for the Model T Ford and in 1938 for the Model A.\n\tFord  Thanks to Lillian (Glendenning) Murray for access to the\n\toriginal documents.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\nThe gas\n\ttank for the Model A, and perhaps for the Model T, was just in front\n\tof the windshield and gas flowed by gravity to the engine.  On very\n\tsteep hills, the Tabisintac for example, the car had to be turned\n\taround and driven backward up the hill.  .  Dad upset the Model T at\n\tGilberts Corner, near Shediac, the day he brought Grace home from\n\tbusiness college.  The Model A sat in the old wagon shed, presumably\n\tbecause of the recession.   Walter said that Dad allowed $2.00 worth\n\tof gas each week but I do not recall for what year.  Gas pumps of\n\tthe day were pumped by hand to fill a chamber at the top of the\n\tpump.  The gas then flowed by gravity through the hose to the gas\n\ttank on a car.\n\t\n\tSchool Lunches\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\nI seldom was able to take a lunch to school \n\t\n\t\n\tbut Arbour Day was an exception.

As I recall, it had a wooden frame about 12 to\n\t15 feet square and a huge shovel or scoop, which was lowered,\n\tthrough the ice to the river bottom.  A mud digger was powered by a\n\thorse or horses and with the aid of pulleys raised scoops of mud and\n\tdeposited them in sleds.  The mud was hauled to farmland which had\n\tbeen plowed earlier in the year and spread.  Mussel mud was rich in\n\tnutrients including lime from the mussel shells.  A load of mussel\n\tmud was very heavy.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\nOne\n\tsummer we built a raft at our shore and then poled it out into the\n\triver to be used as a diving platform.  I recall anchoring it over\n\tthe place where the mud had been dug then jumping off and trying to\n\treach bottom.  I didn\u2019t (yet); others may have.  Recently Cameron\n\tMacDonald reminded me that we (presumably some of the other boys,\n\tnot me) pushed him off the raft into deep water and he couldn\u2019t\n\tswim.\n\t\n\tFollow-up\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\nMentioning\n\tthe shortening pail reminded Donald Edge of carrying limejuice to\n\this grandfather, John W.

After moving back, grandparents didn\u2019t need photos\n\tbecause they lived next door.

I am reminded of similar\n\twinters in the Miramichi when I was a youngster.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\nBefore\n\tthe advent of snow ploughs, after a winter storm, the men of the\n\tcommunity would hitch their horses to sleds and break the road. \n\tBreaking the road meant putting a \n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\nfirst\n\ttrack through the deep snow.  One team would make a track through\n\tthe snow for a ways then another team would take a turn.  If the\n\troads were badly drifted, sometimes a track would be made through\n\tthe woods at the edge of the road.  A couple of the worst spots for\n\tsnow were \u201cKen\u2019s Hill\u201d and at the Middle Black River School. \n\tBecause roads were often below the level of the fields, the \u201cgut\u201d\n\twould drift full.  The other common problem was when several storms\n\twith high winds occurred close together and the road drifted full\n\teach time after it was ploughed.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\nAs\n\troads were rebuilt, ditches were deepened, road surfaces were raised\n\tso snow would blow off, wooden fences were removed or replaced to\n\treduce the build up of snow and snow fences were erected in fields\n\tparallel to the road to catch the snow\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\nLater\n\tyears also brought better snow removal equipment.  The earliest I\n\tremember were the road graders and the crawler tractors.  The\n\tcrawler tractors could turn sideways on the road and push the snow\n\twell off the road.  By the winter of 1952, there was at least one\n\tsnow blower available at the Government garage in Chatham.  Today\n\theavy trucks are on...",

When walking, people would step on to the bank to walk\n\tpast the puddle.  \n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\nOn\n\tone such occasion, Mrs. Harper was walking above our place.  The\n\tbanks were not as high as in the photo.  She stepped up on the bank.\n\t As she walked her feet began to break through the snow.  The snow\n\twas soft and packed easily.  Each time she tried to lift one foot\n\tout of the snow, the other would cut in.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\nGeorge\n\tand I must have been playing near by because I remember helping dig\n\ther foot out of the snow and walk past the pool of water.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\tThe\n\tSound of Running Water\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\nRunning\n\twater brings different thought to the mind of different people.

Banks of snow on the sides of the road\n\tand shallow ditches kept the water on the road and soon it was\n\trunning down the centre of the road.  Soon the road would begin to\n\twash out.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\nThe\n\tmen would dig a ditch/trench over top of the ditch to get the water\n\tto run there.  Running water soon cut through the snow and kept the\n\twater off the road.

The original Glenelg in the\n\thighlands of Scotland is both a village and a mountainous peninsula\n\tand a bay in Ross-Shire that look across the Sound of Sleat to the\n\tIsle of Skye.  This highland name Glenelg is said to derive from the\n\tGaelic Gleann Seilg, the Glen of Hunting.  \n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\nThere\n\tare many other Glenelgs, including  a Glenelg village and lake in\n\tNova Scotia, and a Glenelg in Ontario.  In the 1830's Lord Glenelg\n\twas England's Secretary of State for the Colonies; and his name\n\tcommonly appears on Australian and New Zealand rivers and street\n\tsigns. \n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\nOur\n\tGlenelg Parish is \"So named for the native place in Scotland of\n\tmajor McDonald of the 78th Highlanders, a prominent resident, who\n\tsettled there about 1790.\"*\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\nOriginally\n\ta part of Newcastle Parish, the New Brunswick Northumberland County \n\tParish of Glenelg was set up in 1814 and included  Nelson,\n\tHardwicke, and a small part of Rogersville. Hardwicke was set up in\n\t1851 as a separate parish, and Rogersville set up in 1881.  Glenelg \n\ttook its final and present form in 1900.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\nIn\n\tthe 1840 Census the old Glenelg Parish had 237 houses sheltering 244\n\tfamilies; 11 houses were under construction [there were 281 houses\n\tin the...",

For those not\n\tfamiliar with a truck wagon, it was a heavy farm wagon with high\n\twheels.  The hayrack sat about three feet off the ground which meant\n\tthat you had to pitch the hay a minimum of four feet before putting\n\tit on the rack and another 6-8 feet when it was loaded.  The rack\n\thad a bit of a well because the sides were built up to clear the\n\twagon wheels.\n\t\n\u00a0\n\t\n\n\tThe hay would be forked onto the\n\twagon.  The first forkfuls were tramped well in the centre of the\n\track.  Then forkfuls of hay were placed around the perimeter.  The\n\tkey was to keep placing lots of hay along the outside and then\n\tbinding it by adding hay to the middle.  The sides of a load of hay\n\twere kept higher than the middle.  Otherwise, the hay on the sides\n\twould just keep slipping off.  \n\t\n\t\n\n\t\u00a0\n\t\n\n\tA well-built load of hay would\n\tbe about 7 feet high above the rack with the sides kept straight. \n\tIt was important to have a solid load because many times it would be\n\ttaken across a rough field and then a mile or two by road before\n\treaching home.\n\t\n\n\t\u00a0\n\t\n\n\tOnce home, a load of hay would\n\tbe driven into the barn and, if at night, the horses unhitched,\n\ttaken out through a back door and stabled for the night.  Otherwise,\n\tthe horses would remain hitched to the wagon while the hay was\n\tunloaded.  It was harder to stick the fork into a load that was left\n\tover night.\n\t\n\n\t\u00a0\n\t\n\n\tBoth Ken and Glenn remarked\n\tabout loads being too big for the barn doors \u2013 sometimes getting\n\tstuck or otherwise being a tight squeeze.

Smith.  Students from Black\n\tRiver walked or biked to Bay du Vin in good weather and traveled by\n\thorse and sled in the winter.  Even after MRHS opened, I remember\n\tNorman taking a horse and sled to Bay Side picking up fellow\n\tstudents along the way and leaving the horse across the road from\n\tthe school during the day in Harrison Smith\u2019s barn.  Of course,\n\tone always carried some hay and oats for the horse while it was\n\tstabled.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\nThe\n\tschool was built, as I recall for $13,000 and opened in January\n\t1940.  My first visit to MRHS was late in the fall of 1939 when\n\tGeorge Watling and biked down to see it.  It was an impressive\n\tbuilding for a rural area.  As the photo above shows, it was two\n\tstory with two classrooms on each level at the front and an\n\tauditorium on the second floor at the back.  At the back on the\n\tlower floor were the principal\u2019s office, boys and girls washrooms\n\tand the furnace room.\n\t\nMRHS\n\thad electric lights, 32 volt as I recall,  operated from a bank of\n\tglass-encased batteries and had a small gasoline engine which\n\tswitched on automatically to charge the batteries. It also had a\n\tcoal-fired furnace.  A very tall flagpole stood in the front yard by\n\tthe driveway.  It looked like a ship\u2019s mast.  The pole, not the\n\tflag on the pole, had to be raised and lowered using a team of\n\thorses.  \n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\nInitially,\n\tMRHS drew its students from the following six o...",

It was used for hauling gravel,\n\tbanking, turnips, manure, firewood, etc, etc, etc. \u2013 and of\n\tcourse, people.  As the name says, it was a cart that dumped; while\n\tloading was difficult, unloading was easy.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\nOne\n\tsat at the front with one\u2019s feet resting on a shaft along the side\n\tof the horse.  The horse\u2019s rump was only a few \n\t\n\t\ninches\n\tfrom the cart box.  A cart was a bit heavy to lift when hitching a\n\thorse but much easier to back up than a wagon.  To unload, one\n\tsimply undid a latch at the front and lifted; gravity did the rest. \n\tI especially remember using a dump cart when harvesting turnips\n\t(before we had a small truck).  The horse walked between two rows of\n\tturnips, and the cart straddled them.  One pulled a turnip, cleaned\n\tand topped it and threw it into the cart.  \n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\nWhen\n\tthe cart was full, one drove to the house.  If the turnips were\n\tdestined for the basement, they had to be unloaded one by one and\n\tdropped down the chute.  If unloaded on the barn floor, the cart\n\tcould simply be dumped.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\nDon\n\tEdge writes:\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\u201cInterestingly,\n\tthe Bay du Vin is described as the \"windy river,\" after\n\tthe notion it is not named after wine, since no grapes grew there,\n\tand that the name comes from Baie\n\tdes Ventes,\n\tBay of Winds. However, a very early map (reproduced in Ganong)\n\tidentifies the area as Baie\n\tdes Ovines\n\tor Sheep Bay. I think this last is the more likely origin of what we\n\tcall Bay du Vin. \n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\nReading\n\tabout the knitting reminded me that one winter in the one room\n\tschoolhouse in Upper Black River the entire school (about twelve of\n\tus) knitted for the troops.\u00a0 I was very young, so I was\n\tassigned writers.\u00a0 I remember receiving a letter ...",

A \u201cpiling chain\u201d was placed around the log\n\tand over the load and attached to a horse on the other side of the\n\tsled.

Your website states that Malcolm's son\n\tJohn was born in Dunderave castle July 24, 1774. But the\n\tMacNaughtons lost the castle and all their lands in the first decade\n\tof the 1700s. By 1711 they final paperwork was finished and\n\tDunderave no longer belonged to them. Dunderave belonged to the\n\tfamily of Campbel of Ardkinglas that lived across loch Fyne from the\n\tMacNauchtans. We are sure that a few members of the MacNauchtan\n\tfamily continued to dwell in the castle for \n\nperhaps another\n\tten years in hope that some way would develop to return the lands\n\tand castle to the MacNauchtans. But that did not happen. Famous\n\thistorians living in that time write that the castle was abandoned\n\tand \n\t\n\t\nnone of the MacNauchtan family lived there\n\tafterwards. So you see, he couldn't \n\nhave been born in\n\tDunderave in 1774\u201d.\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\nDarts\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\nWe\n\tsometimes played darts.

Youngsters weren't worth the lugging, and were thought to have not much dignity, and so late on Saturdays they were bathed in a zinc washtub set in the middle of the kitchen floor, youngest first. \u00a0\n\n\n\n\nIn the most private of moments everyone resorted to an outdoor privy and chamber pots. Chamber pots could be quite fancy.\u00a0 Every home in Black River had one or more wash stands, each containing a small bowl for washing, a water pitcher, a wastewater bowl, and a chamber pot.\u00a0 Today these are just for show, but when I was a boy these were the hallmarks of a well kept home and a public display that cleanliness is next to Godliness. Given the circumstances and the equipment, we were about as clean as could be expected.\u00a0 For that matter, we were probably about as Godly as could be expected, all things considered.\n\nI was always too young to be trusted with carrying a brimming chamber pot downstairs and outside to wherever filled pots went to, and so I know nothing about that end of the business, nor to this day do I care to. \u00a0\n\n\n\n\nOuthouses, privies, were small clapboard or shingled buildings; ours was whitewashed inside and out, rather elegant touches.

Little Annie MacNaughton was the local\n\ttelephone operator, and of course she got to hear everything, as\n\tcould anyone else who picked up the phone whenever it rang anyone's\n\tnumber.  There was a benefit to this, because a continuous cranking\n\tcaused a continuous ringing in all the homes in the area, alerting\n\tfamilies to a disaster such as a barn on fire, a forest fire, a\n\tsudden death.\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\tToday\n\tthe phones there are modern and private.

In later years, Norman would butcher a young heifer\n\tand peddle it from door to door around Black River.  Jack Gibson was\n\ta butcher and often peddled meat and later Will Harris was a regular\n\tmeat peddler.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\nButchering\n\twas done just inside the large barn doors.

I am sure that many readers could do the same.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\nSometime\n\tbetween September 1949 and June 1951 I learned to twist and solder\n\tpigtails; I forgot all about it until I came across a soldering pot\n\tamong my mementos. The above photo shows the soldering pot with the\n\twire handle.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\nIn\n\tthose days electricians made joints by twisting the ends of wires\n\ttogether; these joints were called pigtails and they were commonly\n\tused in house wiring.

The exact\n\tyear is unknown, however, it would be around 1950. Although my\n\tfamily did not fish, here is my under- standing of how winter smelt\n\tfishing with box nets worked.\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\tSmelt fishermen on the\n\tMiramichi still set box nets, usually double, through the winter ice\n\tin the same way as they have for perhaps 100 years or more.  While\n\tthe fishing method is the same, \u201cOld Dobbin\u201d has been replaced\n\tby snowmobiles and four wheelers.  \n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\tA box net, as the name\n\tsuggests, is a rectangular box about 14 feet wide and fifty feet\n\tlong; the depth varies depending on the depth of the water.  The\n\tmesh is slightly under an inch compared with a salmon net where the\n\tmesh is about five inches.\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\tA flat piece of netting,\n\tcalled a leader, juts out from each side of the net for a distance\n\tof 100 feet.  Since smelts swim against the current, the leader is\n\tplaced across the current and helps guide fish into the net.  Fish\n\tcome to the leader and, if they turn the right way, in attempting to\n\tswim around the net find themselves trapped in the \u201cbox\u201d part of\n\tthe net.  The net is designed for easy entrance; once inside,\n\thowever, it is almost impossible for a smelt to swim out.  The\n\tentire net is placed under the ice.  \n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\tThe photos show a slot, a\n\tsmelt hole, in the ice up to 14 feet long and maybe 15 inches wide. \n\tSmelt holes were cut using an ice saw, now a chain saw, and kept\n\tclear with a chisel as needed.\n\t\n\n\tThe centre of the box net is\n\tplaced directly under this hole and, anchored to toggle sticks, a\n\tforked stick frozen into the ice close to the smelt hole.  \n\t\n\n\n\n\tThe outer ends of the net\n\talso need to be anchored.

The first record of the name Watling was found in Sussex, England somewhere between London and Dover.\u00a0 It is likely that the name arises from Wartling which was a hamlet in the area but others believe that it was associated with Watling Road. By the time of Richard 1, the Watling name had spread north to Watlingford in Oxfordshire, Watlington in Norfolk, Essex and Hertfordshire.\u00a0 Many Norman families moved north to Scotland in the 12th century and this might have included some Watlings.\n\n\n\n\nThe Roger Watling Website includes the following comments about the origin of the Watlings:\n\n\n\n\n\"In the 5th/6th century a band of people crossed the North Sea from Europe to the British Isles, we do not know if it was one or more boats, but as a yachtsman sailing these waters I would suppose the latter, there being safety in numbers.\u00a0 They knew where they were going as trading was and had taken place long before, also they would have had oral stories from their forbearers who might have served in the Roman Legions, without a shred of evidence I like to think that they were Angles, or possibly Jute in origin rather than Saxon.\u00a0 The leader of this band was WACEAL, and those with him of the same clan, tribe or group were the Waceal - ingas.\u00a0 Ingas was not the son of as in the Scottish Watson, but meaning people of or followers of Waceal, so members of this group would be referred to as Wacelaingas.\u00a0 As time past the name began to change from, the vowels hardening, or softening, plus the input of people from other tongues and one form was...",

Houses #77 and #78 were located in the Fox Island Establishment.**\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nMost of the settlers arrived in the 1820s and 1830s. The earliest settler identified in the Glenelg Census is widow Sarah McIntyre (house #59), who arrived from America in 1774.\u00a0 Widow Isabella McInnes (#88) arrived from Scotland in 1778. The oldest resident was \u00a0 88 year old widow Elizabeth McKnight in house # 158, \u00a0 the youngest was one month old Barbara MacDonald\u00a0 in house #69.\n\n\n\n\nWhile there were many labourers, and remarkably quite a few servants, the great majority were farmers, although some had a \u00a0 sideline.\u00a0 There was one farmer who was also a cooper (barrel-maker), one lighthouse keeper (Escuminac), one mason, two carpenters, two millers, two proprietors, three joiners, five shoemakers, seven teachers,\u00a0 eight lumberers,\u00a0 nine fishermen, ten river pilots, and ten weavers.\u00a0 John McDonald (house #123) was a fisherman and Magistrate.\n\n\n\n\nChatham had many farmers, but most were folks whose occupations you would find in any town.

After the peas had been shelled, it carried out the hulls.\n\n\n\n\nIn the fall, the apron was used to bring in apples that had fallen from the trees.\n\n\n\n\nWhen unexpected company drove up the road, it was surprising how much furniture that old apron could dust in a matter of seconds.\n\n\n\n\nWhen dinner was ready, Grandma walked out onto the porch, waved her apron, and the men knew it was time to come in from the fields to dinner\n\n\n\n\nIt will be a long time before someone invents something that will replace that 'old-time apron' that served so many purposes\n\n\n\n\nSend this to those who would know, and love the story about Grandma's aprons.\n\n\n\n\nREMEMBER:\n\n\n\n\nGrandma used to set her hot baked apple pies on the window sill to cool\n\n\n\n\nHer granddaughters set theirs on the window sill to thaw.\n\n\n\n\nThey would go crazy now trying to figure out how many germs were on that apron.\n\n\n\n\nI don't think I ever caught anything from an apron.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Family Chronicle (Copyright\u00a9\uf87f) is an occ...",

From age 3 to\n\t11 I lived on the Charlie Ebbett farm. Ivan was my younger brother.\n\tArch Ginson 's drag saw was similar to the one in the: picture on\n\tthe cover of this issue. In place of a horsepower he had a Waterloo\n\tengine, which was common in rural Carleton Co. in the 1930's, but\n\thorsepower\u2019s were still in use at that time too. \n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\tA\n\tlittle beyond the wagon shed on the Charlie Ebbett farm there was a\n\tpile of wood. Sometimes it was in long lengths waiting to be sawed\n\tinto blocks. Sometimes it was in blocks waiting to be split. And\n\tsometimes it was split into pieces that would fit into the firebox\n\tin the kitchen range, with larger chunks set aside for the triple\n\theater. \n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\tAfter\n\tthe ground was frozen in December, and before the snow was so deep\n\tthat it was difficult to travel in the fields and through the woods,\n\tDad would harness the horses in the morning and hitch them to the\n\tbobsleds. Ivan and I would often go with him on the sleds, or on\n\tvery cold mornings walk behind to keep warm, past the barn and about\n\ta mile out through the fields to the woods. \n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\tMum\n\twould make sandwiches, r...",

In particular, I recall:\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\n\n\t\tGravel,\n\t\tmostly shale from one of pits (MacDougall pit in Hexham, Finno pit\n\t\tnear Little Branch Bridge,   Harry\u2019s Hill on the north side of\n\t\tthe Little Branch.)  Also there was a large pit on the McKnight\n\t\tRoad, a pit in Finno\u2019s bank used when gravel was hauled on the\n\t\tice for rebuilding the Little Branch Bridge.  In talking with\n\t\tBrother Ken, we think that there was a gravel pit at John W.\n\t\tMacNaughton\u2019s and one above the Moncton Highway on the North Side\n\t\tof Black River but cannot recall them.\n\t\t\n\n\n\t\tGravel\n\t\twas loosened with a pick and shoveled by hand on to wagons and\n\t\tcarts.  I know there were ramps where horses could travel up a ramp\n\t\tpulling a scoop, and empty the gravel into a dump cart or on to a\n\t\twagon but I cannot remember one in Black River.  Drivers did not\n\t\tshovel gravel; they pulled into the pit and waited while others\n\t\tloaded their wagons.\n\t\t\n\n\n\t\tFor\n\t\thauling gravel, truck wagons were fitted with a flat bottom made\n\t\tfrom small straight poles or 2x4\u2019s.  The side of the gravel box\n\t\twas a six or eight inch plank in its edge.  The box also had both a\n\t\tfront board and a tailgate.  When the wagon reached the point where\n\t\tthe gravel was needed, front and rear gates were removed and planks\n\t\tand poles were lifted so that the gravel dropped to the road.

Not long after he was killed by a falling tree while clearing his land on the Little Branch back road.\u00a0 He was the second person buried in the common burial ground on Gunn's Point that was owned by Enoch Godfrey and that was to become the site of St. Stephen's cemetery.\u00a0 The first buried there was Robert MacBeath in 1823.\n\n\n\nThere was indeed a gravel pit immediately west of John W's.\u00a0 I don't know the ownership--possibly Rankin MacLean--but lots of different folks would get gravel there, and MacNaughton household children would play there on the way to and from school. It was especially popular during pollywog season.\u00a0 After\u00a0 John W's death and the closing of the sawmill, much of the land on the north side of the road became a giant gravel pit to feed construction needs for miles around. The area looked like a moonscape; the sight brought tears to the eyes of my Uncle Mac.\n\n\n\nI spent a lot of time at Rankin MacLean's --Marvin was my very best friend\u00a0\u00a0 I also went next door to see Ramsay--his home was spartan bare and very clean.\u00a0 Ramsay chewed tobacco and had badly stained teeth, and he was fond of giving ladies young and old a kiss on the lips, something that the ladies quickly learned to ward off.\n\n\n\n\nMusic\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nWhile Carol and I were attending a concert recently, I remembered that I had not mentioned music in my Chronicles.\u00a0 Although I checked some of the titles, I remember every one of the songs listed.\u00a0 I also recall WWVA, Wheeling, West Virginia; CFCY, Charlottetown; and a station in Quebec.\u00a0 Don\u2019t just look at the titles, hum each tune.\n\n\n\n\nChurch\n\nOld Rugged Cross\n\nWill your Anchor Hold\n\n\n\n\nDare to be a Daniel\n\nOnward Christ...",
