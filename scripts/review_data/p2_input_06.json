Sketch outline lacks substantive development, suggesting preliminary notes or incomplete draft. Reference to rural education and one-room schools suggests nostalgic connection to educational past.

He proposes establishing committees to scout trust fund opportunities (MacDonald, Carver, Cotton trusts), creating a Challenge Fund, developing a Charitable Legacy Account program, and leveraging special community projects like MacPhail Homestead.

  "summary": "A keynote address delivered to school principals in Shediac, New Brunswick in May 1970, where Don presents provocative ideas about educational systems and alternatives to traditional schooling. He defends discussing controversial matters, critiques the supervisor role with humor, addresses automation and human capacity, and poses fundamental questions: Why do we need teachers? Why Departments of Education? Why administrators? Why schools? He proposes alternative models ranging from historical apprenticeship through contemporary professional models where teachers work independently, learners choose educators, and payment follows service delivery. Don envisions a future where instructional aids and programmed materials support home-based learning, specialists work in professional clinics, and state responsibility focuses on licensing and ensuring basic literacy. This visionary speech demonstrates Don's radical thinking about institutional change and futures thinking in education.",

  "summary": "(166 words):** Don challenges Canada's credential obsession, noting that displayed degrees tell little about actual competence. He critiques how institutions award credentials based on pre-set programs that may not reflect real occupational requirements. Don distinguishes between degrees, diplomas, and certificates, finding transcripts more useful than general credentials. He argues employers rarely request formal credentials during hiring and suggests current credentialing systems fail to address employer concerns about communication skills, math/science knowledge, Canadian history, and work habits. The piece questions three fundamental issues: what credentials society needs, who should award them, and on what basis. Don advocates for reform of credentialing practices to better serve both students and employers, moving beyond institutional convenience toward meaningful assessment of actual competencies needed in the workplace.",
