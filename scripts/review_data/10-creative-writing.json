Instead, the Department\n\tappears to be structured around clients served.\n\t\n\nAutonomy\n\t\u2013 as mentioned earlier, education is a service.  Front line\n\tservice providers (teachers) need both expertise and autonomy to\n\trespond to learner needs.\n\tThe OECD tells us\n\tthat PISA results are better for students in schools with autonomy\n\tfor their day-to-day operation; the World Bank advises Ministries of\n\tEducation to delegate.

The Government\u2019s role is to encourage, support and regulate. It\u2019s provision of services should be equiabl. We should rethink this view.\u00a0 Education is a service to both individuals and communitiest\n\n\n\n\nInstead of funding schools, it should fund services for individuals such\u00a0 as: Literacy\n\n  \nNumeracy\n  \nSelf care\n  \nEmployment preparation\n  \nInterpersonal relations\n\n\nAnd service for communities\n\nFunding levels may vary: full cost of literacy and numeracy, full cost of a full year of art and career training; full\u00a0 cost of 17 police officers half the cost of one PhD in any field. Monthly fees\u00a0 50 days of training in your specialty\u00a0 every five years\n\n\u00a0\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSincerely\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDon Glendenning\n\n\n\n\nInformation is an important education service in its own right and deserves its own recognition; it should separated other functions and made widely available to ...",

Spurred by community interest, HTH now operates a \u201cvillage\u201d of three small high schools, two middle schools, and an elementary school at its Point Loma site in San Diego, serving over 2,000 students. In September 2007, as the first organization to receive a Statewide Benefit Charter from the California Board of Education, HTH opened two additional high schools in San Diego County, one in San Marcos and one in Chula Vista. These new schools will anchor similar \u201cvillages\u201d in those communities; a new middle school will open in San Marcos in August 2009.

Overall, 80% of HTH graduates have enrolled at four-year universities, including Johns Hopkins University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Stanford University, Howard University, University of Southern California, University of San Diego, University of California at Berkeley, New York University, and Northwestern University. The retention rate is high, too: of 774 HTH graduates since 2003, 82% have graduated or are still enrolled in college.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nMuch of this achievement is due to the HTH design, with its emphasis on creating the conditions where students and teachers can work and learn effectively.

Issues identified: (1) Clarity\u2014lack of definition and shared understanding, perpetuating \"educationese\" jargon; (2) Purpose\u2014PEI's stated purposes lack necessary detail for program development and assessment; (3) Education versus schooling\u2014fundamental definitional confusion confuses roles and increases costs; (4) Structure\u2014failing to organize around identified functions, particularly administrative and instructional services; (5) Autonomy and accountability\u2014insufficient educator autonomy limiting responsiveness to diverse learner needs, despite OECD research showing autonomy improves outcomes; (6) Personalization\u2014calendar-driven delivery ignores individual learner needs and interests; (7) Government relationship\u2014political operation of education systems introduces inefficiency and instability; (8) Quality assurance\u2014tension between teaching and grading roles; (9) Human and social capital\u2014isolation of teachers prevents collaborative culture.

Don identifies five characteristic categories affecting change resistance: autonomy, clarity, accountability, structure, and culture. He then catalogs contemporary issues across K-12 and higher education: higher education faces student debt, completion rates, mental health, accreditation questions; K-12 confronts funding, safety, discipline, technology, charter school debates, standardized testing, teacher salaries, bullying, poverty, class size. Structural barriers include unclear purpose, limited autonomy, undefined accountability, inadequate reward systems, and risk-averse culture. Additional issues span health/wellness, equity, governance relationships, and resource adequacy.

Don defines education as preparation for life's roles and schooling as instruction delivered through institutions. He identifies typical education functions (policy/governance, instruction, human resources, products/technology, information/counselling, funding, quality assurance) and notes that PEI education services emerge from multiple government departments. Key structural issues include: lack of overarching public statements about education beliefs, narrow mandates for education departments, insufficient community engagement, politicization, and lack of clear accountability.

There is a widespread call for change\nfrom many quarters, including educators, employers, and the public at\nlarge. The field is broad, interests are diverse and widespread and\nresources are scarce.  At the same time, the need for information is\nboth urgent and widespread.  \n\n\nInformation\nis the fuel of change and, while the availability of relevant\ninformation does not guarantee change, it certainly supports it. \nEducation First is of the view that\nproviding the public with relevant information, in addition to being\nuseful in its own right, will support the public in its quest for\ngreater participation in the education process.  One approach is to\ndevelop and distribute to the public a series of occasional papers on\nmatters of interest and concern\n\nProposal\n\nTo gather and\ndisseminate information geared to the public at large especially\nthose with children still in the education system.  Education first\nproposes to do this through a series of occasional papers focused on\ntopics gleaned from our conversations with educators and the public\nalike.  The primary focus will be on topics that, in the view of\nEducation First, contribute to a quality education for every\nCanadian.\n\nCharacteristics\n\n\t\n\nEach issue is a\n\tstand-alone issue\n\t\n\nLimited to two\n\tsides of a standard page\n\t\n\nA standard\n\tformat will be developed.\n\t\n\nGuest authors\n\taccepted\n\t\n\nEach\n\tpaper is a stand alone \n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInitial\ntopics\n\n\t\n\nOutcomes and\n\tcompetencies\n\t\n\nStandards\n\t\n\nIndependent\n\tlearners\n\n\nApproaches\n\n\t\n\nWork with\n\tJournalism students, teachers in training, paid journalists,\n\tretirees\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdministration\n\n\t\n\nCommittee\n\tto ...",

Don applies systems theory to education, defining a school system as a human-made entity with bounded components, relationships, designed outputs, and governing rules. He describes the current system's purpose as helping youth gain skills, knowledge, and attitudes for life roles, existing as either preparation for employment or personal growth.

  "summary": "A personal letter in verse form dated December 13, 1987, apologizing for not responding sooner to a friend's letter while noting that the friend's words are being published through a prestigious university (Cambridge, implied by \"Located on the Cam\"). Don expresses both personal reflection on his changing life circumstances and a broader philosophical pondering about identity and material trappings. The tone is warm, introspective, and shows Don in his post-Holland College consulting phase.",
