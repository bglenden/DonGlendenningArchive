Structured around PEI context (160,000 residents needing continuous learning), Key Definitions (Education, Educated, Teacher, Student, School, Education System, Good Education), Typical Education Services (Governance, Instruction, Products/Technology, Information, Counselling, Professional Support, In-service Training), and Principles (learners learn at own pace, collaboration benefits learning). Major section addresses Structural Issues (school/education confusion, clarity gaps, unclear purpose, product-focused structure, autonomy constraints, unstated accountabilities, cultural barriers, absence of market-driven self-correction mechanisms). Education Issues include competency vs. outcome confusion, collaboration barriers, inadequate progress reporting, relevance gaps, passive development role, narrow field focus, and student ranking problems.

Characteristics include independent governance, fee-for-service operation, direct or referral-based client acceptance, performance-based certification, provision of competency gap information, and extensive use of advisory panels.

Why Departments of Education? Why administrators? Why schools? He proposes alternative models ranging from historical apprenticeship through contemporary professional models where teachers work independently, learners choose educators, and payment follows service delivery.

It provides key definitions distinguishing learners, education, instruction, learning, teaching, and education systems. Operating beliefs emphasize that education occurs beyond schools, that home is the major contributor, and that institutions&#x27; importance is declining. The document identifies typical functions and support services of education systems, provincial government mandates, and multiple service providers. It catalogs education issues including service gaps, politicization, lack of autonomy, and over-emphasis on knowledge. The framework identifies barriers to change (politicization, bureaucracy, inertia) and characteristics of quality systems (accessible, affordable, flexible, accountable, transparent). Key intervention points address assessment, mission, government role, and autonomy.<div class="expanded-tags"><span class="badge badge-low">EDUCATION</span> <span class="badge badge-low">FAMILY</span></div><div class="expanded-file"><a href="read/framework-20-1.html">Read</a> · <a href="files/Framework-20-1.docx">Download</a></div></div></td>

He critiques how institutions award credentials based on pre-set programs that may not reflect real occupational requirements. Don distinguishes between degrees, diplomas, and certificates, finding transcripts more useful than general credentials. He argues employers rarely request formal credentials during hiring and suggests current credentialing systems fail to address employer concerns about communication skills, math/science knowledge, Canadian history, and work habits. The piece questions three fundamental issues: what credentials society needs, who should award them, and on what basis. Don advocates for reform of credentialing practices to better serve both students and employers, moving beyond institutional convenience toward meaningful assessment of actual competencies needed in the workplace.<div class="expanded-tags"><span class="badge badge-low">EDUCATION</span></div><div class="expanded-file"><a href="read/sorting.html">Read</a> · <a href="files/Sorting.doc">Download</a></div></div></td>

Comprehensive educational philosophy document presenting Don&#x27;s theoretical framework including the Road of Life metaphor, definitions of essential skills, descriptions of typical education system services, and beliefs about education&#x27;s purpose. Extensive sections address learners and learning processes, articulating that learners bring &quot;three pieces of luggage&quot;: innate conditions, prior learning, and imagined futures. The document outlines future educational directions emphasizing individualized service delivery, competency-based curricula, and independent qualification authorities. Also includes detailed rating scales for assessing student understanding across five-point spectrum. This represents Don&#x27;s mature educational philosophy, developed through years of reflection on how education systems should evolve to serve diverse learners.<div class="expanded-tags"><span class="badge badge-low">EDUCATION</span></div><div class="expanded-file"><a href="read/various.html">Read</a> · <a href="files/Various%20.docx">Download</a></div></div></td>

Design analysis document for exterior siding options for the Glendenning cottage addition/renovation project. Don methodically evaluates four siding options based on multiple criteria: colour, board width, surface finish, groove patterns, and cost. Options evaluated include cedar rough-sawn (Option One), Cape Cod style (Option Two), vinyl (Option Three), and spruce panels (Option Four). The document demonstrates systematic decision-making: comparing existing stained vertical siding characteristics with alternatives, noting aesthetic considerations like colour matching and paint/stain durability, and evaluating cost implications. The preferred option ultimately recommends using spruce 4x8 panels while painting the entire cottage to achieve uniform appearance and address matching concerns. Reflects Don&#x27;s methodical, analytical approach to problem-solving.<div class="expanded-tags"><span class="badge badge-low">PERSONAL_AFFAIRS</span></div><div class="expanded-file"><a href="read/glendenning-cottage-addition.html">Read</a> · <a href="files/Glendenning%20cottage%20Addition.docx">Download</a></div></div></td>
