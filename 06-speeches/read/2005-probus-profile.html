<p><br></p>
<p>Educational interests and philosophy</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Mother saw teaching as a stepping-stone - community</p>
<p>Teachers college for six months</p>
<p>A former minister then a civil servant owed the family some money – I went to his office every two</p>
<p><span class="Apple-converted-space">         </span>weeks to collect</p>
<p>Started taught in Kouchibouguac when still 17 for $110 per month</p>
<p>Govt was encouraging males to go into teaching so I received an extra $200 at the end of</p>
<p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>the year for being male</p>
<p>	</p>
<p>	Got hooked on Manual training,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>My studies thereafter were in technical and vocational education<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Not available in Canadian universities so studied in USA</p>
<p>Taught for nine years before I really began to understand what teaching was all<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>about</p>
<p>Beaverbrook Scholar quite an eye-opener for a young farm boy</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Normal schools/Teachers colleges played an important transitional role for poor people</p>
<p>Community colleges followed</p>
<p>Seems to be a gap now</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Philosophy<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>	A person’s word is his bond</p>
<p>	Work for others s you would work for yourself</p>
<p>	Most important kind of education is that which helps people improve their job prospects.</p>
<p>I’ve devoted my life to this</p>
<p>Education is vocational, regardless of the subject studied, when one uses it to improve job prospects<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>whether it be in elementary, secondary school , college or university.</p>
<p>	Unfortunately, that kind of education is not valued.</p>
<p>Our society is the worse for this attitude</p>
<p>Storm days</p>
<p>Emphasis on application not acquisition</p>
<p>Lack of will to implement changes</p>
<p>Takeover of education by the professionals</p>
<p><br></p>
