<p><b>Opening</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>1A</b>	As a follow-up to earlier conversations, I wanted to provide you with some detailed information about the Community Foundation of Prince Edward Island and also let you know of a new initiative to build a charitable legacy over a period of years.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>First, however, let me say a few things about community foundations.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>1B</b>	This letter comes to introduce you to the Community Foundation of Prince Edward Island (CFPEI)</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Community Foundations</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Community foundations, and there are 170 in Canada today, create and administer permanent endowments for charitable purposes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The goal is to improve the lives of individuals and their communities.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This is accomplished by making grants for the purposes, and only the purposes, designated by individual donors. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Funds from donors are pooled and invested in perpetuity; earnings are used to make grants. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The Community Foundation of Prince Edward Island serves the entire Province, is governed by a volunteer board widely representative of Island life, maintains an office in Charlottetown, has assets of well over a $1 million, makes grants annually in excess of $50,000, is being used increasingly by Islanders to host their charitable legacies, is registered with both the Canada Revenue<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Agency and the IRS,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>is transparent and open while following sound business practices. Investments are professionally managed, books are audited annually and reports are public.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Although one of the newer community foundations in Canada, we are well experienced in the latter approach having created and now administering over 60 endowments for the<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>benefit of Island organizations and individuals.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Community Foundations, and there are now 160 in Canada, administer endowments on behalf of individuals and organizations.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The donor transfers money to CFPEI, the Foundation issues a tax receipt, invests the monies, and makes grants annually in the Fund’s name and based on the donor’s directions.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The Donor can direct that grants be given as scholarships, or as gifts to charities or causes for which they have a passion, or for causes which the Foundation identifies, or for some combination of all of these.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Endowments</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Community foundations are relatively new on the scene and are unique in that they focus on the building and administration of charitable endowments.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Endowments are usually set up by individuals as part of their estate planning, to mark a significant event in their lives or to remember a loved one; We also administer funds for other charitable organizations that want to take advantage of our expertise.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Having been involved in one way or another with the establishment of more than 60 endowments, I feel comfortable in saying that CFPEI is the most experienced organization on the Island when it comes to designing charitable legacies reflecting donor interests and community needs.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Granting</b></p>
<p>Grant from the income are made in perpetuity in support of the interests of the person(s) setting up the fund.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Among our grantees we include UPEI and Holland College students, hospitals, youth groups, health organizations, the planting of memorial trees, heritage, arts, etc.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>CFPEI Activities<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p>CFPEI also plays a role as “conveners” meaning that we bring people or organizations together to explore common interests in improving our community.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As an example, a few years ago through our initiative, more that $800,000was provided to the Arts in PEI over a four year period.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A second service is that of flow-through grants to other charities. For example, one US donor, who wishes to remain anonymous, makes a gift to CFPEI along with instructions as to where grants are to be made.</p>

<p><br></p>
<p><b>Services</b></p>
<p>Our normal services include:</p>
<p>Designing and establishing endowments. Investing and monitoring performance, and auditing and reporting on to both the public and the Canada Revenue Agency</p>
<p>Making grants that reflect a donor’s wishes and create value within the charitable sector; a donor’s wishes could be as simple as naming charities of interest to which grants are to be made</p>
<p>providing information and advice to individuals, organizations and other foundations on existing and potential community needs</p>
<p>accepting donations of any kind including cash, real estate, personal property, stocks, bonds and other financial instruments; this could include acting as Executor to an estate</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>All of us are faced with decisions on a regular basis as to how much we can give and to what causes; there are many needs and all are worthwhile, so we make our decisions based on our unique set of criteria.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Too often, I feel we leave decisions about a rainy day legacy fund until very late in life.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We at the foundation believe that legacy decisions should be made earlier and built over time<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Decisions about one’s estate are both important and personal; increasingly people tell me that, after family have been taken care of, they want to give back to the community that supported them, not just an annual contribution but in the form of a permanent legacy.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Many are opting to make that provision now rather than after death.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Reasons for choosing a community Foundation</b></p>
<p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>It has been customary for donors to make separate donations to each organization representing their charitable interests; unfortunately, the legacy gets dispersed; in addition, not all charitable organizations are in a position to handle endowments effectively.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The alternative is to place ones charitable legacy with a community foundation, thereby keeping the legacy intact and flowing grants to the individual charities of interest on a regular base and in perpetuity.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is the latter approach that we recommend and the one increasingly being chosen when establishing legacy funds. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>I</p>
<p>We chose the Community Foundation because:</p>
<p>CFPEI is managed by local volunteers who know the needs and can monitor the impact of donations in perpetuity</p>
<p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>CFPEI provides great flexibility in being able to make grants to several different causes as directed by the donor when the Fund is set up</p>
<p>Funds are professionally managed according to a comprehensive Statement of Investment Policies and Guidelines and monitored by a volunteer Investment Committee.</p>
<p>CFPEI has the capacity to provide significant tax savings through the gifting of equities and other gifts with appreciated capital gains.</p>
<p>Administrative costs at community foundations are very reasonable and much lower than those I’ve found elsewhere.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Increasingly, people are using community foundations as a one stop operation to handle their charitable interests.  For example, they set up a fund from which the Foundation can make grants to their church, scholarships and favourite charities; also, donors are leaving some funds undesignated in order to respond to emerging community needs</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Draft Agreement</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I’ve enclosed a draft agreement to illustrate the type of arrangement the Foundation enters into with someone establishing a Legacy Fund. Obviously, any agreement would have to be crafted to reflect your interests which may, in fact, be quite different from this proposal.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Administration</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>If donors are comfortable with their financial advisor and would like them to continue to manage their account, the Foundation can certainly accommodate but it may be beneficial to talk with us before you make that decision.  We would also be happy to brief your lawyer on the nature of community foundations and their work.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The community foundation model for charitable trusts has been so successful that many financial institutions are now adopting it.  The difference being is their main interest in managing funds while community foundations work to ensure that your charitable interests are honoured in perpetuity.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>There are financial benefits to making charitable contributions through the transfer of stocks; if this interests you, we would be delighted to discuss this further with you.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Further information</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I am enclosing information about the Community Foundation of Prince Edward Island; should you have any questions, please do not hesitate to get in touch.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If you think it useful to discuss ideas and options, whether or not they include the Community Foundation, do not hesitate to call.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Whatever your decision, please know that I am willing to help in any way that I can.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Penultimate Paragraph</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>I, and we, at the Community Foundation of Prince Edward Island, have appreciated your interest and support in times past and would welcome an opportunity,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>preferably to assist you but if not then your Executor, in hosting an endowment to carry your legacy into the future.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>If you require additional information or would like to explore options and ideas, do not hesitate to contact me</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I'll be in touch again in early September, and in the meantime, enjoy the rest of the summer</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Some people find it useful just to talk to someone about a giving plan – to consider the various options and alternatives rather than the specifics of grants to organizations.  If you feel that such a conversation would be helpful, do not hesitate to let me kno</p>
