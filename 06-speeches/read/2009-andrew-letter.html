<div class="reader-content">
<p>April 29, 2009</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Mr. William E. Andrew</p>
<p>Director and Chief Executive Officer</p>
<p>Penn West Energy Trust, Suite 2200</p>
<p>425 First Street S.W</p>
<p>Calgary, Alberta	T2P 3L8</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Dear Mr. Andrew:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Community foundations, and there are 150 in Canada today, administer charitable trusts on behalf of individuals and organizations.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The Community Foundation of Prince Edward Island serves PEI and is governed by a group of 12 volunteers drawn from across the Island. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Among our endowments is the Living Trust initiated by the Keuper Family for the purpose of enhancing public spaces throughout Prince Edward Island.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In 2007, in cooperation with the Government of Prince Edward Island, a cluster of red oaks was planted on each side of the entrance to the Confederation Trail at Wood Islands.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We plan to plant similar clusters at other trail entrances as funds permit so that, when the oak trees mature, trail entrances will be very recognizable by their oak clusters.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In addition to oak clusters, however, there will be both designated and undesignated plantings along the trail. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>While not limiting ourselves to Trail entrances, due to interest and financial support from individuals in the Milton community last year, we planted trees along the Confederation Trail where it intersects the North Yorke River Road at Carleton Station near Route 2.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We are told, and as you may already know, this is a very popular site and is used by many – walkers, bikers, joggers and snowmobilers in winter.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Because of the continued interest by the community in further planting and the fact that the Department of Tourism plans to erect a story board in the area, we will focus on that area again this year.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We are currently awaiting confirmation from the Department of Public works and Transportation that they will shortly clean up and prepare the area at least to the first bridge.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Because of your connection to the area, this letter seeks to explore any interest that you may have in supporting the planting of trees at the North Yorke River Road location.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That location lends itself to a number of possibilities including:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>A cluster of three oak trees on each side of the Trail entrance and on both sides of the road, for a total of 12, have been identified for donor named trees. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Named trees in a number of areas along the trail</p>
<p>General planting of trees in the area</p>
<p>Some benches and a picnic table</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Should you have an interest, I would be delighted to discuss the idea further.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>At the same time, should you have other ideas as to how the Foundation can serve you, please do not hesitate to let me know.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I am enclosing some information about the Foundation; you may also find our website,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>HYPERLINK "http://www.cfpei.ca" <span>www.cfpei.ca</span>, of interest. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I am not certain how often you return to PEI but expect that you will be here shortly for the UPEI convocation activities.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If so, I would be delighted to meet you and to discuss the idea in detail.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>On the other hand, please feel free to phone me at my home, 902-892-5859, should you have any questions.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Thanks in advance for your consideration</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Don Glendenning</p>
<p>Director</p>
<p><br></p>
