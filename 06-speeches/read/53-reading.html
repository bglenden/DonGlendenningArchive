  53  Reading
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Extensive analysis of literacy challenges in Prince Edward Island and Canada, presenting statistics showing 30-40% of Islanders lack adequate literacy. Examines definitions of reading, competencies, and curriculum outcomes in Atlantic provinces. Emphasizes that reading development begins in early childhood and home environments, arguing that schools alone cannot address literacy deficiencies without community and family support.</div>

	<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">If you are
	seriously interested in reading, or helping someone improve their
	reading skills, I  suggest that you pause at this point, come up
	with your own working definition, either one of the above or in your
	own words.  Mull it over, think about it in relation to yourself,
	your children and grandchildren, or the student that you are

	<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">It’s the home
	that determines how well and how soon we read; that means directing
	more help and resources to help parents, grandparents and siblings. 
	What’s needed is development not schooling; it is different from
	schooling in that is focused to a large degree on formation, mental
	and emotional health, TLC, confidence and encouragement and not

	<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Sending children to
	pre-school programs is not the same as providing supporting
	development.  Occasionally I read articles that suggest that

	help.  They can and do help with skill building; unfortunately their
	schedules do not allow them to deal with deficiencies from the early
	years. They can help remove the deficiencies of the early years and
