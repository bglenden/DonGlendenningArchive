  2010-1 Heritage Cemeteries
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Strategic proposal for a Heritage Cemetery Network (HCN) as a non-profit organization to address cemetery maintenance concerns across PEI. Don documents community concerns about physical maintenance and trustee recruitment, particularly in cemeteries unattached to active churches. The proposal outlines a funding model incorporating local fundraising, family fees, endowments, and surplus fund transfers. Don suggests CFPEI establish a commission to explore implementation. This document demonstrates his commitment to preserving heritage infrastructure and addressing rural community needs through innovative organizational solutions.</div>

<p><b>COMMUNITY FOUNDATION OF PRINCE EDWARD ISLAND</b></p>
<p><b>Heritage Cemetery Network </b></p>
<p> <b>Background</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>On a number of occasions community leaders have expressed concern about the care of cemeteries throughout the Island, especially cemeteries not directly attached to an active church; the most recent being on Monday with heritage activist, Dr. Catherine Hennessey.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The concerns are twofold.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>One concern is that of the actual physical care and maintenance – lawn, fences, shrubs, sunken graves, signage, etc.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The other is concern about the ability to recruit future trustees.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Regarding the latter, it was pointed out that many trustees are often carrying on a family tradition, are aging and, with the out migration of people from rural areas, new trustees are becoming difficult to recruit.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Concept <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p>The concept is of a Heritage Cemetery Network, (HCN) as a not-for-profit organization whose main purpose would be to offer care and maintenance of heritage cemeteries.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Funds could come from many sources and the organization would seek registration as a charitable organization thereby allowing it to receive and receipt donations.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Individual cemeteries would enter into an agreement whereby, for a fee,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>HCN would provide maintenance services.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The costs of maintenance could be met in a variety of ways;</p>
<p>The local community could raise funds annually for the purpose</p>
<p>Families with relatives in the cemetery could pay an annual fee</p>
<p>Interested people and organizations could establish endowments for the purpose</p>
<p>Existing surplus funds and trusts could be used to establish endowments with CFPEI</p>
<p><b>Proposal </b></p>
<p>CFPEI proposes to establish a commission to explore the idea further and to make recommendations. 	<span>						</span><span>2010-02-02</span></p>
