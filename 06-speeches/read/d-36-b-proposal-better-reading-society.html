  D 36 B Proposal -Better Reading Society
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">An August 2011 proposal to establish an independent reading improvement association to increase Islander capacity to address reading challenges. Don provides compelling evidence of the reading crisis: 42% of adults lack Level 3 literacy, students underperform nationally, and projections show 30% of Canadian Grade 6 students struggling with literacy. He advocates for reading focus based on its foundational importance, multiple intervention points, and existing community readiness. The proposal includes objectives for raising awareness, organizing public events, supporting advocacy, and raising initial funds. Budget details include part-time promotion staff, incorporation, public information sessions, and media launch, showing Don&#x27;s understanding of the infrastructure needed for successful public campaigns.</div>
