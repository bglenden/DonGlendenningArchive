<p><b>A CALL FOR CLARITY -A</b></p>
<p>4-1-11</p>
<p>As a frequent participant in conversations about education, I am struck by the absence of definitions and boundaries; communication and understanding may suffer as a result.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Conceptual clarity is a must to understand the people we serve, the services we provide, learner needs, product, processes and values especially when the subject carries layers of subjectivity. The Dictionary of Education (Good) defines definition as “the process of determining the definition or meaning of a word, idea or proposition in general and within a given context; the process of assigning meaning enhances both precision and clarity.”</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Education is complex; information plays a key role.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Learners have different interests, experiences, capabilities and needs; they also fill a variety of life roles. Those who teach, or other-wise serve learners, must be very clear in their communication. Conceptual clarity heightens our understanding of key words and concepts; lack of clarity is a significant issue for public education.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It must be addressed directly so that the concept of education won’t become d-luted and potentially ineffective. Lack of clarity may arise form an idea itself, from the person promoting the idea or from the person receiving the idea; Lack of clarity could also signal conflicting ideas and levels of discomfort or disagreement from within the education family group itself and some say<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“clarity” is also related to self confidence.<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Conceptual clarify is also a must in planning and assessing performance. Education has a reputation for generating “educationese”; in fact, one can purchase an education “jargon generator”.</p>
<p>For example::</p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li4">The Department adopted “Education and Lifelong Learning” in title; are both needed??</li>
  <li class="li4">There aer many references to “helping<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>young in society”; shouldn’t Department serve all Is-landers?</li>
  <li class="li4">A Philosophy paper refers to helping young people to “secure a place” in society; How do we design programs to prepare for “a<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>secure place”?</li>
  <li class="li4">I know thai the Department develops curriculum but is that the chief role?</li>
  <li class="li4">Most releases from Department focuses on school matters; seldom do they deal with<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>matters of education.</li>
  <li class="li4">A recent report by World Bank cautioned developing countries for treating “education” and going to school as though they are one and the same. Aren’t we doing the same?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
</ul>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li4">Alberta is “preparing citizens for tomorrow”</li>
  <li class="li4">New Brunswick is helping citizens gain “attributes needed to be a lifelong learner”</li>
  <li class="li4">An anonamous source refers to “ preparing for life, work and citizenship”.</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s probably time to review and clarify our key “direction-setting ‘ documents.</p>
