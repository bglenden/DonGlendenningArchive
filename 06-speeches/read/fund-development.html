  Fund development
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">This memo from Don to Tom Davies outlines strategic recommendations for CFPEI&#x27;s development approach as Don transitions from the Development Committee chairmanship. The letter advocates for shifting focus from pursuing large donations from wealthy individuals to building broader donor bases through smaller contributions and community engagement. Don recommends targeting younger people (forties rather than seniors), organizing presentation-style information sessions in communities, and engaging entire board membership in development. He proposes establishing committees to scout trust fund opportunities (MacDonald, Carver, Cotton trusts), creating a Challenge Fund, developing a Charitable Legacy Account program, and leveraging special community projects like MacPhail Homestead. The memo reflects Don&#x27;s evolving philosophy that &quot;dollars will follow&quot; from engagement rather than strategic asks.</div>

<p>Date:		</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>To:		Tom Davies</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>From:		Don</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Subject:	Development</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Some thoughts, in random order, for your consideration:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The following have been churning in my mind for some time and, even though I am leaving the Chairmanship of Development, I decided to pass them along to you.</p>
<p>Some general comments:</p>
<p>I have been concentrating on individuals who, in my mind, have the potential for large donations.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Instead, I would put more effort into seeking donations say to the Island Fund or to simply starting a fund of their own..<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That’s not to ignore people with potential perhaps we should let it grow out of smaller contributions.</p>
<p>I enjoyed my cold calls but think, on reflection, that I should have spent more time meeting with groups<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Presentations of the kinds that investment houses make, I feel, have the potential for the future.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Even informal information sharing sessions in small communities would be appropriate.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Thhe focus should be on our services and successes rather than our structure.</p>
<p>I’ve been limiting myself to seniors; in the future, I would focus on younger people – perhaps in their forties.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We also need to select younger people for the Board and committees.</p>
<p>.In some ways, we have focused too much on the traditional role of encouraging individuals to include us in their estate planning.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We need to engage people in our activities.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Dollars will follow</p>
<p>My “asks” are often of people that I do not see in my normal routines, therefore, I must make a special point of seeing them to follow up.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If we had an occasional social event to which our “potentials” were invited, it would provide a contest in which follow-up would be easy.</p>
<p>Entire Board needs to be engaged in development</p>
<p>A high priority is to sevure some professional help in support of development.</p>
<p>In terms of actual initiatives:</p>
<p><span>Existing Trusts</span>, why not a small committee or even committees to scout out opportunities, make presentations, maintain contact and negotiate agreements..<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We have been in touch with a number of trusts such as MacDonald, Carver, Cotton, etc but do not have a system for follow-up.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Again, a social event would facilitate the process.</p>
<p><span>S</span>ome productive areas could be rotary trusts, the Schurman trust , Webster trust; who will look after them when the family is gone.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Perhaps a campaign to have new trusts name CFPEI as their fall back when the family no longer is around to operate it.</p>
<p><span>The Island Fund</span> lends itself to a general appeal for donations.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is a natural for Islanders Away and for the younger crowd.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>2014 is a special year for PEI; could we claim it for our Island Fund?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><span>Challenge Fund</span> through which we provide some incentive to other groups to build endowments.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A related idea is to work with organizations to take advantage of existing challenge funds such as the agreement we have with Indian River.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That matching grant program is also available to a number of other arts organizations.</p>
<p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><span>Special projects</span> where we become an advocate, not for a group but for a community improvement.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I recall in Las Cruces, NM that the local community foundation got behind a project to provide a suitable structure <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>to save an historic clock during a downtown development project.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>MacPhail Homestead could be such a project.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Education</p>
<p>Initiate a Charitable Legacy Account to encourage people to establish a “bequest ready” endowment based legacy fund towards to which they contribute on a regular basis and can make additions as personal circumstances allow – first five years free of admin fees and no payout.</p>
<p><span></span><br></p>
<p>In terms of target groups:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Other 2</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>It is my view that we have to begin to think differently.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The above are only ideas for consideration.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Thanks for listening.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Don <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
