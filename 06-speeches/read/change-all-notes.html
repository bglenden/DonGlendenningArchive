<div class="reader-summary">Nearly identical to File 5, this is an expanded draft of Don&#x27;s change management compendium. Contains same ADKAR and Kotter models with identical content and conclusions about the nature of organizational change. The presence of two slightly different versions suggests Don was refining this material for publication or presentation purposes.
- **Key People**: Don Glendenning (author); John Kotter; Prosci

Organizations
can no longer continue in their old ways; change is the new constant.
 Most businesses have had to reinvent themselves, and will likely
have to do so again – and again.  Education is no exception.  Cost,
consumer demand, the economy, the changing environment, changing work
requirements, technology - all contribute to the need for change.  In
the case of education, pressures form  change arrive from changing
student demand, impact of technology, different job skills
requirements, declining enrolments, shortage of funds, etc</p>

<u>1	Prosci's
ADKAR</u>
Model of individual change (<u><a href="http://www.change-management.com/tutorial-essence-of-adkar.htm" target="_blank">read

ADKAR describes the five key building blocks an individual needs to
make a change successfully, whether at home or in the workplace.  
</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
The

<h3>Step 1: Create Urgency</h3>
<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
For
change to happen, it helps if the whole company really wants it.
Develop a sense of urgency around the need for change. This may help
you spark the initial motivation to get things moving. 
</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
This
isn't simply a matter of showing people poor sales statistics or
talking about increased competition. Open an honest and convincing
dialogue about what's happening in the marketplace and with your
competition. If many people start talking about the change you
propose, the urgency can build and feed on itself. 
</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
What
you can do:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0in">
	Identify potential threats, and develop scenarios showing what could
	happen in the future.</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Examine
	opportunities that should be, or could be, exploited.</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Start honest
	discussions, and give dynamic and convincing reasons to get people
	talking and thinking.</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0.19in">Request
	support from customers, outside stakeholders and industry people to
	strengthen your argument. 
	</p></li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><img src="img/change-all-notes/img001.png" align="bottom" />
</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<strong>Note:
</strong><br />
Kotter
suggests that for change to be successful, 75 percent of a company's
management needs to &quot;buy into&quot; the change. In other words,
you have to really work hard on Step 1, and spend significant time
and energy building urgency, before moving onto the next steps. Don't
panic and jump in too fast because you don't want to risk further
short-term losses – if you act without proper preparation, you
could be in for a very bumpy ride.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in"><img src="img/change-all-notes/img002.png" align="bottom" />
</p>
<h3>Step 2: Form a Powerful Coalition</h3>
<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
Convince
people that change is necessary. This often takes strong leadership
and visible support from key people within your organization.
Managing change isn't enough – you have to lead it. 
</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
You
can find effective change leaders throughout your organization –
they don't necessarily follow the traditional company hierarchy. To
lead change, you need to bring together a coalition, or team, of
influential people whose power comes from a variety of sources,
including job title, status, expertise, and political importance. 
</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
Once
formed, your &quot;change coalition&quot; needs to work as a team,
continuing to build urgency and momentum around the need for change. 
</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
What
you can do:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0in">
	Identify the true leaders in your organization. 
	</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Ask for an
	emotional commitment from these key people. 
	</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Work on team
	building within your change coalition. 
	</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0.19in">Check your
	team for weak areas, and ensure that you have a good mix of people
	from different departments and different levels within your company.
		</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Step 3: Create a Vision for Change</h3>
<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
When
you first start thinking about change, there will probably be many
great ideas and solutions floating around. Link these concepts to an
overall vision that people can grasp easily and remember. 
</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
A
clear vision can help everyone understand why you're asking them to
do something. When people see for themselves what you're trying to
achieve, then the directives they're given tend to make more sense. 
</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
What
you can do:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0in">
	Determine the values that are central to the change. 
	</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Develop a short
	summary (one or two sentences) that captures what you &quot;see&quot;
	as the future of your organization. 
	</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Create a
	strategy to execute that vision. 
	</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Ensure that
	your change coalition can describe the vision in five minutes or
	less. 
	</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0.19in">Practice
	your &quot;vision speech&quot; often. 
	</p></li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><img src="img/change-all-notes/img001.png" align="bottom" />
</p>
<h3>4: Communicate the Vision</h3>
<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
What
you do with your vision after you create it will determine your
success. Your message will probably have strong competition from
other day-to-day communications within the company, so you need to
communicate it frequently and powerfully, and embed it within
everything that you do. 
</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
Don't
just call special meetings to communicate your vision. Instead, talk
about it every chance you get. Use the vision daily to make decisions
and solve problems. When you keep it fresh on everyone's minds,
they'll remember it and respond to it. 
</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
It's
also important to &quot;walk the talk.&quot; What you do is far more
important – and believable – than what you say. Demonstrate the
kind of behavior that you want from others. 
</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
What
you can do:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0in">
	Talk often about your change vision.</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Openly and
	honestly address peoples' concerns and anxieties.</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Apply your
	vision to all aspects of operations – from training to performance
	reviews. Tie everything back to the vision. 
	</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0.19in">Lead by
	example. 
	</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Step 5: Remove Obstacles</h3>
<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
If
you follow these steps and reach this point in the change process,
you've been talking about your vision and building buy-in from all
levels of the organization. Hopefully, your staff wants to get busy
and achieve the benefits that you've been promoting. 
</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
But
is anyone resisting the change? And are there processes or structures
that are getting in its way?</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
Put
in place the structure for change, and continually check for barriers
to it. Removing obstacles can empower the people you need to execute
your vision, and it can help the change move forward. 
</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
What
you can do:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0in">
	Identify, or hire, change leaders whose main roles are to deliver
	the change. 
	</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Look at your
	organizational structure, job descriptions, and performance and
	compensation systems to ensure they're in line with your vision. 
	</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Recognize and
	reward people for making change happen. 
	</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Identify people
	who are resisting the change, and help them see what's needed. 
	</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0.19in">Take action
	to quickly remove barriers (human or otherwise). 
	</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Step 6: Create Short-term Wins</h3>
<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
Nothing
motivates more than success. Give your company a taste of victory
early in the change process. Within a short time frame (this could be
a month or a year, depending on the type of change), you'll want to
have results that your staff can see. Without this, critics and
negative thinkers might hurt your progress. 
</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
Create
short-term targets – not just one long-term goal. You want each
smaller target to be achievable, with little room for failure. Your
change team may have to work very hard to come up with these targets,
but each &quot;win&quot; that you produce can further motivate the
entire staff. 
</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
What
you can do:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0in">
	Look for sure-fire projects that you can implement without help from
	any strong critics of the change. 
	</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Don't choose
	early targets that are expensive. You want to be able to justify the
	investment in each project. 
	</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Thoroughly
	analyze the potential pros and cons of your targets. If you don't
	succeed with an early goal, it can hurt your entire change
	initiative. 
	</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0.19in">Reward the
	people who help you meet the targets. 
	</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Step 7: Build on the Change</h3>
<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
Kotter
argues that many change projects fail because victory is declared too
early. Real change runs deep. Quick wins are only the beginning of
what needs to be done to achieve long-term change. 
</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
Launching
one new product using a new system is great. But if you can launch 10
products, that means the new system is working. To reach that 10th
success, you need to keep looking for improvements. 
</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
Each
success provides an opportunity to build on what went right and
identify what you can improve. 
</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
What
you can do:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0in">
	After every win, analyze what went right and what needs improving. 
	</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Set goals to
	continue building on the momentum you've achieved. 
	</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Learn about
	<u><a href="http://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newSTR_97.htm">kaizen</a></u>,
	the idea of continuous improvement. 
	</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0.19in">Keep ideas
	fresh by bringing in new change agents and leaders for your change
	coalition. 
	</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Step 8: Anchor the Changes in Corporate Culture</h3>
<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
Finally,
to make any change stick, it should become part of the core of your
organization. Your corporate culture often determines what gets done,
so the values behind your vision must show in day-to-day work. 
</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
Make
continuous efforts to ensure that the change is seen in every aspect
of your organization. This will help give that change a solid place
in your organization's culture. 
</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
It's
also important that your company's leaders continue to support the
change. This includes existing staff and new leaders who are brought
in. If you lose the support of these people, you might end up back
where you started. 
</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
What
you can do: 
</p>
<ul>
	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0in">
	Talk about progress every chance you get. Tell success stories about
	the change process, and repeat other stories that you hear. 
	</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Include the
	change ideals and values when hiring and training new staff. 
	</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Publicly
	recognize key members of your original change coalition, and make
	sure the rest of the staff – new and old – remembers their
	contributions. 
	</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0.19in">Create plans
	to replace key leaders of change as they move on. This will help
	ensure that their legacy is not lost or forgotten. 
	</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Key Points</h2>
<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
You
have to work hard to change an organization successfully. When you
plan carefully and build the proper foundation, implementing change
can be much easier, and you'll improve the chances of success. If
you're too impatient, and if you expect too many results too soon,
your plans for change are more likely to fail.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
Create
a sense of urgency, recruit powerful change leaders, build a vision
and effectively communicate it, remove obstacles, create quick wins,
and build on your momentum. If you do these things, you can help make
the change part of your organizational culture. That's when you can
declare a true victory. then sit back and enjoy the change that you
envisioned so long ago.
