20/20 Inc.	</b></span></p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><span lang="en-US">Education
20/20 is a national, not-for-profit education organization, located
in Charlottetown, PEI. We are governed by a volunteer Board of
Directors, comprised of people who have demonstrated an interest in
and knowledge of education, but are not representative of an
educational constituency. Our mission is to improve the quality of
education for every Canadian. Our activities to date include
newsletters, workshops, a website, a presence in the social media,
and an award to an Island school for demonstrating a high level of
engagement in its day to day operation. </span>

<p align="justify" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><span lang="en-US"><b>Education</b></span></p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><span lang="en-US">We
believe that education is the most important issue of the day, an
issue that confronts parents, students, teachers, teaching and
learning experts and everyday Canadians concerned with the challenges
we encounter within our system and beyond.  Education is the force
that shapes who we are as individuals; shapes our communities and our
country.  It is our view that, with a quality education, many of our
other problems would be reduced and some even eliminated.</span></p>
<p lang="en-US" style="line-height: 100%; margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in">
<br />

</p>
<p align="justify" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><span lang="en-US">Education
is a community issue and a complex one at that; it is important,
therefore, that we work from a common set of beliefs or at least know
where each is coming from.  The brochure in front of you provides
some working definitions; they may not be the ones you see in
education text books or dictionaries but we consider them practical
working definitions for everyday use.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><br />

</p>
<p align="justify" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">In
summary, we believe: 
</p>
<ul>
	<li><p align="justify" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">
	Education consists of experiences that have a formative effect on
	the way we feel, think and act. 
	</p></li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li><p align="justify" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">
	Its purpose is to help each of us develop the attitudes, skills and
	knowledge needed help us cope with, enjoy and contribute to the
	situations we create or those that befall us during the rest of our
	lives. 
	</p></li>
	<li><p align="justify" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">
	Education starts in the home with family being the main source of
	instruction, help and influence.</p></li>
	<li><p align="justify" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">
	Our community invests heavily in schools for two purposes, to help
	individual Islanders develop their full potential and to ensure that
	our community has the people needed to grow and prosper.</p></li>
	<li><p align="justify" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">
	Learning results in change, not just about new knowledge, but
	changes in the way we think, feel and act.</p></li>
	<li><p align="justify" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">
	The role of a teacher is to help us change from what we are to what
	we want to be – to gain new information, gain new skills or change
	the way we feel and act.</p></li>
	<li><p align="justify" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">
	Education and schooling are not the same; one gains an education
	whether or not one attends school.</p></li>
	<li><p align="justify" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">
	Education is more than the acquisition of knowledge.</p></li>
	<li><p align="justify" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">
	Being educated is a process of changing behaviour.</p></li>
	<li><p align="justify" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">
	Being taught is the act of accepting help in making that change.

<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><span lang="en-US">An
education system includes the following services:</span></p>
<ul>
	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><span lang="en-US">Instruction</span></p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><span lang="en-US">Funding

</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><span lang="en-US">Provinces
organize and coordinate educational services through Departments of
Education; even a quick examination of Provincial organizations,
however, reveals the focus of Departments to be on schools and
schooling rather than education; this is the equivalent of operating
a health system through our hospitals.  While education in the US is
a responsibility of state governments, Departments of Education
include both a Board of Education to set policy and a Department of
Public Instruction to carry it out.  </span>

<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><span lang="en-US"><b>Conversations
with Islanders:</b></span></p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><span lang="en-US">Islanders
want to see changes in their education system; they want to engage in
the change process and be a continuing part of its operation.
Islanders want a system focused on developing lifelong learners
rather than our current system focused on the acquisition of
knowledge and delivery of curriculum outcomes.  There is a need for
greater flexibility within the system to take advantage of new
opportunities and innovations at the local school level.  The call
for change is widespread but there is little evidence that it is
being heard.  If the call was heard, it is being ignored, or decision
makers have decided not to engage the community in the change
process, or the system may not have the tools or systems in place to
enact required changes. </span>
</p>
<p lang="en-US" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><br />

</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><span lang="en-US">Education
20/20 has spent considerable time during the past few months
conversing with Islanders about education.  Some of the conversations
occurred during a series of workshops held across the Island. 
Participants were both articulate and passionate in their comments,
and most discussions continued long past the allotted time.  We came
away from these sessions realizing that Islanders know what they want
in the way of education.  What they do not understand is why they are
not included in the discussion about bringing about desired changes. 
In the words of one Islander, “Government talks a great story about
education being a partnership, but it’s only talk.”  </span>

</p>
<p lang="en-US" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><br />

</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><span lang="en-US"><b>Where
should change begin?  </b></span>
</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><span lang="en-US">Change
can begin almost anywhere; it can start wherever a person and the
education system intersect. Change should be not only allowed, it
should be encouraged; in fact, not only encouraged but required.    </span>
</p>
<p lang="en-US" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><br />

</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><span lang="en-US">One
obvious place is to start with a learner or learners, your child or
grandchild, or a neighbour’s child.   What kind of help does the
child need? counselling?  better reading skills? personal management
skills? technical skills? How we can provide that help and what
priority should it have?    </span>
</p>
<p lang="en-US" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><br />

</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">A second
possibility, and one that may help you to understand the frustrations
of parents, is to identify an area of study that should be added to
the curriculum; coding or robotics for instance.  Once you’ve
chosen a subject, follow the steps and timelines from inception to
students actually enrolling.

<p lang="en-US" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><br />

</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><span lang="en-US">Last
January, Education 20/20 convened a workshop at the Town Hall in
Stratford.  When it came time for discussion, the first question
asked was “What is the role of schools?”  The fact that it was
asked tells us something about our school system and explains in part
why there is a difference in expectations between the people who
operate the school system and those who use it.  That question would
be a good place to start – but there are many others.</span></p>
<p lang="en-US" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><br />

</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><span lang="en-US">In
closing, we call your attention again to the small brochure in front
of you where you will find a list of characteristics of a quality
education.  This list draws heavily on a couple of </span>OECD and
UNICEF reports but it also reflects, we believe, comments and
suggestions that Islanders shared with us.  It could provide a good
jumping off point for further discussion. 
</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><br />

</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">A quality education
system is one where:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p align="justify" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">

	<li><p align="justify" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">
