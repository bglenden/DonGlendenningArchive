  2015-note to Committee
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Brief email communication to a committee summarizing progress on employer needs assessment since their meeting. Glendenning distinguishes between two separate needs: employers finding mathematically skilled workers and improving math instruction overall. Reports gathering considerable information about math skills and competencies, coordination with Lori Johnston for a presentation on Workplace Learning PEI services, and mentions TOWES (Test of Workplace Essential Skills) as an alternative assessment tool. Notes his temporary absence from the province.</div>

<div class="reader-content">
<p><span> </span>I was certain that I sent a letter following our meeting but apparently not; here’s a summary of what’s happened since:</p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li1">There appears to be two separate needs:</li>
</ul>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li1">One is for employers to find people with the math skills they need – this is the subject of this Email</li>
  <li class="li1">The second is an over- all plan to improve instruction in math; we’ll deal with that later<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
</ul>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li1">As far as I can determine, a survey of employers’ math needs has not been done.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li1">I’ve gathered considerable information about math skills, outcomes and competencies; and believe that we have a set of tasks suitable for the survey.</li>
  <li class="li1">Given our focus on employers’ needs, I’ve spoken with Lori Johnston, Manager, Workplace Learning PEI, an organization that works directly with individuals and employers in assessing training needs, training workers and helping employers develop a capacity to offer training to their employees.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Lori has agreed to make a presentation to our group, probably during the second week of March.</li>
  <li class="li1">If they wish, employers could simply skip the survey and administer a TOWES Test of “basic skills”; both Holland College and Workplace Learning PEI offer such services – and there may be other sources as well.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I’ll keep looking.</li>
</ul>
<p>I’ll be out of Province for the next two weeks, but hope to move the initiative along when I return.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
