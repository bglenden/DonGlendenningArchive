</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">In
Canada education is a provincial matter. Provinces agree, it seems,
that they have a responsibility to help their citizens develop
attitudes, skills and knowledge at least to the level of good
citizenship; although not as clearly stated, Provinces also have a
responsibility to ensure that their community includes the capacity
to care for itself.   In PEI, that means encouraging more and better
education for all 145,000 Islanders and providing financial support
for some – not an easy task surrounded by a world of rapidly
increasing complexity and while experiences equally changing change
in what we know, what we do and how we act.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">It
is widely recognized that education is a key factor in determining
one’s quality of life; in the same way, the collective education of
our citizens will determine to a significant degree the future of our
community and country.  One of the most frequently mentioned concerns
by Islanders is the low level of basic skills in our workforce, among
recent graduates and young Islanders generally.  Evidence for concern
arises from <span lang="en-US">PISA
results, recent CFPEI survey of Island youth, presentation to the
Standing Committee on    by, How Canada Performs; Provincial and
Territorial Ranking, Education and Training; Education and Skills,
and a series of workshops on Preparedness held throughout PEI by
Education 20/20 Inc.  </span><span lang="en-US">While
the concern applies to the state of education generally, this paper
limits itself to skills we need to be functioning members of our
respective communities and, in particular to the field of
mathematics.  </span>

<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">PEI,
like most Provinces, has a mix of educational providers</p>
<ul>
	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">The
	Department of Education and Culture delivers math instruction
	through the school system based on a curriculum developed by the
	Northern and Western Proto-col and used in six other Provinces.   
	</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">The

<b>Underlying beliefs about
math education:</b></p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">We
believe that a common set of underlying beliefs for math education
would be helpful and propose the following:  
</p>
<ul>
	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">the
	performance level of a person in a field of math is determined by
	the nature and range of skills that a person can demonstrate, level
	of performance at which each skill can be demonstrated, extent or
	degree of clustering.  
	</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Outcomes
	and competencies are not age related.</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Mandating
	those who teach to also “sort” constitutes a conflict of
	interest</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Bloom’s
	Taxonomy provides an appropriate basis for establishing levels of
	proficiency 
	</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">To
	the extent possible, outcomes, skills or competencies should be
	stated in terms that apply directly to learners and be part of a
	learner’s support material</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Alignment
	between potential competencies offered, those studied, levels
	learned, levels demonstrated, levels achieved, , credentials awarded
	and qualifications acquired.</p></li>

<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><span lang="en-US"><b>Conclusions</b></span></p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Based
on our collective knowledge of education generally of Education 2/20
Inc. and referring to education in mathematics in particular, and
arising at least in part from the issue of transitioning raised by
the Council of Ministers of Education Canada, we’ve reached the
following conclusions:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">An
	inconsistency in the way we describe math content through our
	education system - skills, competencies or outcomes</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Confusion
	about levels of achievement and who defines them</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Lacks
	common assessment criteria and rating scale used to assess student
	achievement</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Reliability
	of math assessments and reporting 
	</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Potential
	for conflict when teachers also grade</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Limited
	communication between and among those who teach and between those
	who hire the product of our teaching.</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Need
	to involve all providers in the education fraamework</p></li>

</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Organizationally,
most provinces operate a public-school system devoted to serving the
needs of young people, a relatively autonomous postsecondary sector,
and a conglomeration of services operated or administered through
provincial ministries of training, and develop-ment.  Add to this a
federal responsibility and funding in support of education for
economic development, for which education is a major contributor, and
we’ve increased the issue of communication and lessened the
likelihood of a focused response.

</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><b>MATH
EDUCATION</b></p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">The
PEI Curriculum Guide for Grade 9 mathematics includes a goal for
students to “become mathematically literate adults”.  It is an
achievable goal, at least for most students but, if math test scores
and public comment are used as the measure, the goal remains a
challenge rather than an accomplishment.  On the economic side, a
2003 multi-country study from the European Commission found that if
the national average educational attainment level is increased by a
single year, aggregate productivity increases by 6.2 per cent right
away and by a further 3.1 per cent in the long run</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><br />

</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Provider
who deliver to youth follow a curriculum approved by the Department
of Education based on a Curriculum Based Outcomes model.  Other
providers base math instruction on a from a variety of sources.  On
the other side of the coin, “receivers” of students have a
variety of math interests and needs not always well documented or
understood.  A common menu of available math “ingredients”;
master list of math skills or competencies do exist with the best
known likely being Common Core State Standards in the USA.  
</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><br />

</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">An
overview of math curriculum in Canada reveals:</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">•	Institutions
of all kinds and at all levels basing curriculum on a form or model
of outcomes; the weakness, using my culinary analogy, they’ve
released them only as recipes.  Our preference would be for a list of
ingredients from which we select items to give education our own
flavor.  
</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">•	Front
line providers are not allowed to develop their own recipes 
</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">•	“Receiving”
organizations are not willing, able or, in some cases, allowed to
articulate their needs using the standard list of ingredients.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">•	In
some cases, there appears to be little interest in knowing users’
needs</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">•	One
of the common characteristics of outcomes and competencies is the
failure to separate the analysis step from that of which competencies
to be taught at which level. Such a separation would greatly increase
flexibility and increase the uses to which analyses could be used.

<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><br />

</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><b>TRANSITION:</b></p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Although
not limited to mathematics, the CMEC, in a media release following
its meeting in July 2016, drew attention to the issue of educational
“transition” which, in the writer’s view, is a major
contributor to our math woes. The above statement by the Council of
Ministers of Education Canada (CMEC) highlights a concern that is
shared by many educators, employers, certification agencies and the
community at large.   Issues in transitioning arise for a number of
reasons including:</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">•	Inconsistency
in the way content is defined - skills, competencies or outcomes</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">•	Absence
of a master list of math skills available throughout the education
system</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">•	Proficiency
levels need further definition</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">•	Lacks
a common criteria and rating scale</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">•	Math
assessments and reporting not perceived as being reliable</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">•	Potential
for conflict when teachers also grade</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">•	Limited,
if any, consultation between and among those who teach.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">•	Employers
generally seem to have little input into deciding what is to be
taught</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">•	Mixed
messages about entry requirements from postsecondary institutions</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><br />

<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><b>PEI</b></p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">•	One
of the common characteristics of outcomes and competencies is the
failure to separate the analysis step from that of curriculum
development.  Such a separation would greatly increase flexibility.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">•	Without
a carefully constructed analysis it becomes easy to confuse levels of
achievement from other outcomes.

</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><b>NOTES:</b></p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><br />

</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">•	the
literature and informed opinion reveals that the curriculum generated
by Alberta is currently under review, that the MPEHC is now asking
that program proposals be competency based, colleges identify
competencies for the programs they offer, com-petencies are widely
used in the health field, Queens University recently announced that
it is converting programs to a competency based model and that a
number of States in the North Eastern USA have switched to competency
based format, as has the Association of Private Schools and Colleges
in the US.  Ontario is seriously review-ing curriculum development in
Mathematics and the Education report in Newfound-land includes a
section on Mathematics. All this to say that I think that
consideration of alternatives is timely.</p>

<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Solving
the math problem “problem” requires collaboration by all levels
of education – public schools, post secondary institutions,

it cannot be solved by the public-school system alone.
