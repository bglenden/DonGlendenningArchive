<div class="reader-summary">(166 words):** Don challenges Canada&#x27;s credential obsession, noting that displayed degrees tell little about actual competence. He critiques how institutions award credentials based on pre-set programs that may not reflect real occupational requirements. Don distinguishes between degrees, diplomas, and certificates, finding transcripts more useful than general credentials. He argues employers rarely request formal credentials during hiring and suggests current credentialing systems fail to address employer concerns about communication skills, math/science knowledge, Canadian history, and work habits. The piece questions three fundamental issues: what credentials society needs, who should award them, and on what basis. Don advocates for reform of credentialing practices to better serve both students and employers, moving beyond institutional convenience toward meaningful assessment of actual competencies needed in the workplace.</div>

<p><b>Canadians like credentials. Places of work, whether they be trade, technical or professional, often display credentials of people who work there. I am not sure if such displays are intended to impress or intimidate. Most credetiaals I enclounter are issued by universities although a few are issued by professional and technical associations.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Such displays tell about some life choices of the bearers have made such as where they went to school, the level of schooling they attained, and maybe some specialized courses they have taken.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>.

<p><b>As the user of services provided by an establishment, I put this information in the category of interesting but not very useful. That is not to downplay the sweat equity students put into the<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>acquisition of diplomas and degrees but seldom do the items on display tell me about the competence of the person about to serve me.</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>To qualify for a degree, diploma or certificate, from an educational institution, a person follows a pre-set program of studies<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>determined by the institution, or an instructor in the institution who may, or may not, have worked outside the institution, or of if he has, he did so many years earlier.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In addition, the criteria may or may not reflect the criteria in the field or occupation in which the learner is preparing.</b></p>

<p><b>In my role as an employer, I cannot ever remember asking for or receiving a copy of a degree or diploma as part of the assessment process; I did, however, find transcripts quite useful.</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>While everybody has their pet peeves about the education system, the complaints I hear usually are about:</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>· Communication skills · Math/science skills · Canadian history or geography · Work habits and attitudes</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Our current approach to credentialing seems not to address these concerns.</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>It is unlikely that we can or should prevent educational institutions from awarding credentials. Based on my own experience and in talking with employers, I question if credentials now offered really serve the public and student needs.</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>On reflection, one is left with three questions. What credentials do we need and why?</b></p>
<p><b>Who should award the credentials we need? On what basis should they be awarded?</b></p>

<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Teachers teach and schools, where most teaching occurs, sort those who are taught.</b></p>
<p><b>Given the apparent confusion between schooling and teaching, this gives schools a key role in determining what will be taught, to whom and when. Most of this occurs while we are young, The sorting function in particular, I believe, has a major impact, much of ",'" /, it negative, on life later choices available to our youth</b></p>

<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Good's Dictionary of Education defines a credential as "a certificate stating that a student has graduated from a certain curriculum or has passed certain subjects with indicated marks". Credentials come with a variety of labels. Most sought after and recognized, I believe would be a university degree, which until recently could only be awarded by a university but now are awarded by some community colleges. The awarding of diplomas follows the same lines but are not as highly regulated and usually involve 2-3 years of study.</b></p>
