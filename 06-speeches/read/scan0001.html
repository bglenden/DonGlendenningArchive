<div class="reader-summary">A keynote address delivered to school principals in Shediac, New Brunswick in May 1970, where Don presents provocative ideas about educational systems and alternatives to traditional schooling. He defends discussing controversial matters, critiques the supervisor role with humor, addresses automation and human capacity, and poses fundamental questions: Why do we need teachers? Why Departments of Education? Why administrators? Why schools? He proposes alternative models ranging from historical apprenticeship through contemporary professional models where teachers work independently, learners choose educators, and payment follows service delivery. Don envisions a future where instructional aids and programmed materials support home-based learning, specialists work in professional clinics, and state responsibility focuses on licensing and ensuring basic literacy. This visionary speech demonstrates Don&#x27;s radical thinking about institutional change and futures thinking in education.</div>

&quot;IT SHALL COME TO PASS...&quot;

Introduction -

TOpic -

appreciate invitation see a number of familiar faces always nice to be back in New Brunswick

Entry into education was7an accident:
-hadn&#x27;t intended to write matrics -considered going into business -here I am - in administration (sometimes think that is as far removed from education as one can~

difficult to know what to say should one be entertaining or serious should one congratulate or antagonize

decided to say some of the things which bother and concern me - perhaps they also .~. you - you know that better than I

I understand your topic is &quot;Supervising Teaching or Teachers?&quot; does a higher authority discuss &quot;Supervising Supervisors and Administrators?

If I am critical of education, teachers, supervisors, studen~, or administrators, please do not be offended. After all I speak as an insider and still consider myself as an educator even as I fill the function of administrator.

I came across the following last week when I was gathering notes for this occasion:
WHAT IS A SUPERVISOR?

If he is pleasant, he is too familiar; if he is sober-faced, he is a sourpuss.
If he is young, he doesn&#x27;t know anything! if he is old, he is an old stiff.
If he belongs to a lodge, member expect favors.
If he goes to church, he&#x27;s a hypocrite; if he doesn&#x27;t he&#x27;s a heathen.
If he drinks, he&#x27;s an old souse; if he doesn&#x27;t, he&#x27;s a tightwad.
If he talks to everybody, he(ß a gossip, if he doesn&#x27;t_ he&#x27;s stuck-up.
If he insists that the rules of the plant be kept, he&#x27;s too particular; if he doesn&#x27;t, he&#x27;s careless. If he looks around, he&#x27;s snooping; if he doesn&#x27;t, he&#x27;s unobservant.
If he tries to settle all complaints, he must have the wisdom as Solomon; if he worries about them, he&#x27;ll soon ,be crazy.
He should 9ave the patience of Job, the skin of a rhinoc~tos, the cunning of a fox, the courage of a lion, be blind as a bat,c&quot;;1.lent as a sphinx.

One could speak of technological change, however that topic is often over played, speaking of that,-

The Globe and Mail reported a story a few years ago of the pilot of a large aircraft who was discussing with a scientist the matter of automation and use of computors in airlines. The conversation dealt with the fact that

the pilots would not be required much longer on such airlines because of the introduction of computors and other automatic controlling devices; The</pre>
