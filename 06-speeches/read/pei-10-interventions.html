  PEI 10 Interventions
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">A comprehensive 10-point intervention framework addressing systemic education reform in PEI. Key interventions include: (1) Shift terminology focus from schools to education; (2) Define purpose through learner life roles; (3) Identify and make education services universally accessible; (4) Restructure according to &quot;form follows function&quot; principle; (5) Grant autonomy to front-line teachers; (6) Apply accountability mechanisms with autonomy; (7) Implement in-service teacher training; (8) Address grading/credentialing through developed qualification bodies; (9) Establish a PEI Education Association. Supporting observations identify 36 systemic characteristics requiring change, from fragmentation and unclear purpose to inappropriate politicization and lack of trust. Glendenning emphasizes these changes must be &quot;dealt with soon, and should be dealt with in a very public manner.&quot;</div>

<div class="reader-content">
<p><b>PEI Interventions - </b><span><b>10</b></span></p>
<p><b>1.	Terminology- change focus from schools to education</b></p>
<p><b>2.	Purpose – the literature refers to helping people find a place in society; that place is a role and should be named or described – a citizen, a producer, a consumer or?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Both content and assessment demand it.</b></p>
<p><b>3.	Services - Education is a service, typical education services include: information, counselling, instruction, products and technology, quality assurance. governance, funding and human resources. Learners may need one or all services at any point in their education journey and services should be front and center in our offerings.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Services need to be clearly identified and available to all Island citizens not only to citizens enrolled in schools and programs.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Whether or not all services are paid for by government is a separate issue.</b></p>
<p><b>4.	Structure -” Form follows function” is still the standard when structuring any venture; one would expect, therefore, that the education structure would reflect services provided.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Instead, the Department appears to be structured around mmclients served.</b></p>
<p><b>5.	Autonomy – as mentioned earlier, education is a service.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Front line service providers (our teachers) need both the expertise and autonomy to respond to learner needs.</b></p>
<p><b>6.	Accountability - The OECD tells us that PISA results are better for students in schools with autonomy for their day-to-day operation; the World Bank advises Ministries of Education to delegate. Mathew Bedard of the Montreal Economic Institute points out that “autonomy and accountability jointly applied” would cost practically nothing and allow education to better adapt to the diversity of student needs and aptitudes. Yet teachers and principals in PEI appear to have little freedom to tailor services to suit individual learner needs.</b></p>
<p><b>7.	In-service training for teachers</b></p>
<p><b>8.	Grades and grading, represents an attempt to apply standardized measurement to levels of achievement on the education journey. Grades also serve as a communication device between a provider and user of a service.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The technology allows us to record and track student progress. Most developed countries have established qualification bodies to deal with the rationalization of credentials and qualifications; Canada should consider the same.</b></p>
<p><b>9.	Need for a PEI Education Association</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>These structural issues are not new; no doubt readers have others to propose. All should be considered. They need to be dealt with soon, and should be dealt with in a very public manner.</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
