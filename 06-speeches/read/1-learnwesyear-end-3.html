<div class="reader-summary">Editor letter assessing education outlook for the coming year, predicting minimal change as government relies on existing 30-year-old philosophy without planned improvements. Notes federal government historically provided education-for-employment leadership through federal-provincial agreements but withdrew that role; recent ad hoc services attempt to address resulting gaps. References postsecondary costs escalation in US and predicts PEI will appreciate school board restoration if accompanied by enhanced professional autonomy and accountability measures.</div>

<p><b>Education Outlook for 20/20</b></p>
<p><b>Education outlook for coming year looks relatively unchanged. Government expected to rely on existing statement of philosophy.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There is not indication that education will deal with the confusing application of education to both formal study in school and the broad term implying help to all learners.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Insiders report that the fear factor is still a major challenge to open debate.</b></p>
<p><b>Historically, education for employment has depended on both financial and educational leadership by the Federal Government (since the Technical Education of 1919); the leadership elemnt was drawn a few years ago.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Yhe recent rsh of ad hoc education services is viewed as an attempt to deal with the problem.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>, I believe at the insistence of the provinces.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Its future not had much Provincial support Likliihood that education for employment will receive a boost.</b></p>
<p><b>The reference to costs of postsecondary education is interesting one;that topic has certainly been an active topic in US scene.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>people familiar with the scene. According to some studies, post secondary costs, especially administrative overhead, haave gotten out of control some would say on the backs of graduate students who do much of the actual teaching.</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Islanders will appreciate the return of school boards; it certainly is a good political move; whether it will contribute to better education will depend in a large part to the degree o autonomy qnd accountability included.</b></p>

<p><b>Sincerely</b></p>
