<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><span lang="en-US">Education 20/20 is
organizing a series of workshops on Education and preparedness
throughout Prince Edward Island.  </span><span lang="en-US">The
basis of the workshops is a survey of youth issues undertaken by the
Community Foundation of Prince Edward Island; the survey gathered
information and sought the views of more than 200 young people
between the ages of 15 and 25.  The report may be read on the
Foundation website, </span><u><a href="http://www.cfpei.ca/"><span lang="en-US">www.cfpei.ca</span></a></u><span lang="en-US">.
 The report identifies a number of ‘concerns and bright spots”;
one of the concerns is that of “preparedness gaps” in regard to
postsecondary education and the workplace.</span></p>
<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><span lang="en-US">Because
we believe that the issues raised in the report are important,
Education 20/20 is hosting a series of workshops throughout the
Island so that Islanders can learn first-hand of the findings.  </span><span lang="en-US">Each
workshop, therefore, will start with a presentation by Steve
MacQuaid, Vice President of the Community Foundation of Prince Edward
Island, and Katherine MacDonald, Researcher, on survey methodology
and findings, a period of 30-45 minutes depending on questions from
the group.  </span>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in"><span lang="en-US">The second part
of the evening will consist of round-table discussions, the number of
discussion groups will depend on the number of participants, but our
objective is to have many discussions rather than consolidate around
fewer tables.  Each table will have a facilitator, someone to keep
the discussion moving, to ensure that all have a chance to voice
opinions and that the discussion is respectful. To allow the
facilitator to focus on the discussion, we suggest a separate
recorder to provide a summary of key points at the end of the evening
and to pass a set of notes to the chair at the end of the evening. 
It is usually useful to open round-table discussions by “going
round the table” and inviting comment from each person before
opening the general discussion. As an aid to the discussion, copies
of the following discussion questions will be available at each
table:</span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in"><span lang="en-US">At the close of
discussions, the Chair will call for each reporter to summarize the
main points and to provide a written report of key points.  The chair
will then close the discussion but invite participants to continue
the discussion.</span></p>
