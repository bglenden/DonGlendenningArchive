<p>Hello Don,</p>
<p>I put together a bit of a blurb in case it is useful for you.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Prince Street Elementary was thrilled to receive the Excellence in Education Award for 2015. We have been working hard to represent the values of our school through an on-going project. Our school had students vote on what "Prince" in Prince Street stands for, and decided on P-Proud, R-Respect, I-Inclusive, N-Never Give Up, C-Caring and E-Empathy. Students and staff also decided on a school mascot and logo, and wrote and recorded a school song with the assistance of an artist and an ArtsSmarts PEI grant. This year we have started monthly assemblies to assist with proactive teaching, understanding, and discussion about what the words proud, respect, inclusive, never give up, caring, and empathy mean. We have used the award money to purchase new curtains and upgrade our stage so that our school can look as good as we feel. Now when students are presenting, singing, and dancing on the stage they can do so in an environment they can be proud of. We are very grateful for this recognition and the opportunity to improve our school for students and their learning.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Thank you,</p>
<p> </p>

<p>We are about to announce the Educational Award for 2016.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Would be interested in a few comments about what the award meant to your school and how you spent the money.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Regards</p>
