<div class="reader-summary">Editor&#x27;s letter summarizing five key arguments for education system restructuring: lack of clear vision beyond youth, confusion of schooling with education, organizational misalignment with function, insufficient autonomy at frontline, and inappropriate use of grading for assessment and ranking. Concludes structural overhaul is necessary to address systemic gaps.</div>

<div class="reader-content">
<p><b>Dear Editor:</b></p>
<p><b>Restructuring called for D-!2</b></p>
<p>My review of education literature and discussion with Islanders suggests a need for changes in the way that public education is structured.</p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li1"><b>Lack of a clear and compelling vision</b>. Islanders think that the Department of Education has a responsibility for education at all levels; Department of Education documents define Education’s role as serving youth.</li>
  <li class="li1"><b>Equating going to school with getting an education. </b>In a 20i9 report, The World Bank, the world’s largest funder of education services,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>cautioned Ministries of Education about the confusion of treating “education and going to school” as though they are one and the same; a review of PEI education documents suggests that PEI has also fallen into that trap. A school, like a hospital or shopping plaza, at best is only a resource rich location; education is influenced by student experiences while there.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li1"><b>Form follows function</b> is still the standard when structuring any venture; services provided by an education system to learners include information, counselling, instruction, assessment, learning products.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Given this, one would expect senior management to reflect these functions in their position titles and for front line workers to have flexibility in responding to learner needs.</li>
  <li class="li1"><b>Accountability </b>The OECD tells us that PISA results are better from schools with autonomy in their day-to-day operation; the World Bank advises Ministries of Education to delegate. Mathew Bedard of the Montreal Economic Institute points out that “autonomy and accountability jointly applied” would cost practically nothing and allow education to better adapt to the diversity of student needs and aptitudes. Yet teachers and principals in PEI appear to have little freedom to tailor services to suit individual learner needs.</li>
  <li class="li1"><b>Grades and grading</b>, represents an attempt to apply standardized measurement to levels of achievement in a course or program; in the education context, each grade is considered equivalent to one year of study.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Grades also serve as a communication device among educators and the people they serve. My eview of the literature<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>suggests that assessing students for the purpose of assigning levels of proficiency and ranking are not teaching functions</li>
</ul>
<p>Given the above, some restructuring is certainly called for.</p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
<p>Don Glendenning</p>
