His emphasis on respectful dialogue and broad participation reflects his commitment to inclusive community problem-solving.</div>

<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li3">The purpose of the workshop is to provide background information on youth issues, to engage people in discussion and identify what, if anything can/should be done.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We want to engage as broad a range of people as possible and especially youth, parents and employers.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li4">The workshop will start with a presentation by Steve MacQuaid, Vice President of the Community Foundation of Prince Edward Island, and Katherine MacDonald, Researcher, on survey findings and will probably last 30-40 minutes depending on questions from the group. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li4">The second part of the evening will consist of round-table discussions; a copy of discussion questions is attached.</li>
  <li class="li4">We are gearing up for 5 tables; the number at each table will depend on the number of participants. Our objective is to have many discussions rather than consolidate around fewer tables. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li4">Each table will have a facilitator, someone to keep the discussion moving, to ensure that all have a chance to voice opinions and that the discussion is respectful.</li>
  <li class="li4">To allow the facilitator to focus on the discussion, we are also proposing a separate recorder to provide a summary of key points at the end of the evening.<span class="Apple-converted-space">     </span></li>
  <li class="li4">It is usually useful to open round-table discussions by “going round the table” and inviting comment from each person before opening the general discussion.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li4">We are allocating 40 minutes for discussion, however that can be lengthened or shortened as the evening unfolds. At the close of discussion, we’ll call for a report from each facilitator and ask each reporter to provide a written report of key points.</li>
  <li class="li4">Bill Whelan has agreed to do a wrap-up the evening; then we’ll encourage attendees<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>to continue the conversation over coffee.</li>
  <li class="li4">We think the topic is important and the discussion timely, and look forward to your participation</li>
