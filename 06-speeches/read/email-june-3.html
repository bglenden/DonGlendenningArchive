  Email, June 3
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Substantive email from Don Glendenning to Executive members (Whelan, Read, Glendenning) dated June 3, 2018, outlining six critical decisions requiring Executive attention. Don emphasizes the need for close coordination with the Executive on handling future items and proposes bi-weekly Executive meetings before Directors&#x27; meetings. Key issues include: Award presentation at Bluefield, evaluation of the Education Award&#x27;s focus and funding model, establishment of hosting project fees (noting competitive organizations charge for such services), financial document amendments from the annual meeting, confirmation of Katherine&#x27;s assumption of MRSB chief contact role, and consideration of expanding the Executive to include Committee chairs. The email demonstrates Don&#x27;s detailed administrative focus and collaborative governance approach.</div>

<p><b>Executive</b></p>
<p>Email to Whelan, Read, Glendenning</p>
<p>June 3, 2018</p>
<p>My understanding is that I should work very closely with the Executive as to the handling of future items; in saying that, we agreed on an Executive meeting two weeks before each Directors meeting.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>While I agree with that, I find that we have a number of items about which decisions must be taken.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Here are six. I expect there may be others:</p>
<p>1.	Award; Jeniene (Awards Committee) and I visited Bluefield and presented the Award; distributed earlier</p>
<p>2.	Time to review the Education Award as to focus, confirm availability and committee including chair.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Discussions with<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>committee and recent recipients reveal support for asking a grant to do something rather than recognizing something already accomplished.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>3.	“Hosting Projects”: we’v now hosted two projects and have been asked about a third,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Many organizations charge a fee for tis kind of service; the issue was raised some time ago and should be resolved.</p>
<p>4.	I was asked to amend some financial documents at the annual meeting; I’ve done one but need some clarification on the other.</p>
<p>5.	Our agreement with MRSB names me as the chief contact; I’ve spoken with Bill, Tess and Katherine; Katherine is willing to assume the role.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It should be confirmed</p>
<p>6.	Given that the President now is also Secretary, should we now consider<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>invitingone or two others to the Executive – Chair of Award Committee and Chair of Souris project committee?????<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Regards</p>
<p>Don</p>
