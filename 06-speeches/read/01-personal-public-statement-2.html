  01 Personal public statement-2
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Public policy statement from Education 20/20 Inc. dated March 16, 2015, framing education gap on PEI. Opens with philosophical statement on education&#x27;s role in life preparation and quality of life. Identifies specific gaps: limited educator-community engagement, lack of comprehensive education philosophy, government focus on youth/schooling only, absence of independent educational information, limited part-time instruction, limited market conditions, politicization of decisions, and constraints on professional autonomy. Outlines five recommendations addressing vision development, learner-centered services, government leadership, instructional delegation, and qualification authority.

<h1 style="margin-top: 0in"><span style="font-weight: normal">Preparation
for life’s roles is called education and the better prepared we
are, the better we are able to cope with all that we encounter, or
create.  And education is made more complex by the fact that e</span><span style="font-weight: normal">ach
person is unique; unique in basic physical, mental, emotional and
social make up, unique in range and nature of previous experience,
unique in perceived futures, but also unique in terms of learning
pace, style and needs. Our education consists of what we have learned
or perhaps even more accurately what we can do as a result of what we
have learned</span></h1>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">It is widely recognized that education
is a key factor in determining each citizen’s quality of life; in
the same way, the collective education of our citizens will determine
to a significant degree the quality of the community in which we
live.  Our government supports education for two reasons, one is to
ensure a high level of personal growth and development for every
citizen; the other is to ensure the common good. 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">There is a gap between what Islanders
have and what they want in the way of education.  Indicators of the
gap include: the limited engagement between educators and the
community they serve; the lack of a philosophy of education that
encompasses all our citizens; government’s focus on the young and
schooling; service gaps such as the availability of independent
information on which to make educational choices; availability of
part time instruction; lack of market conditions normal for a sector;
politicization of decision making and limits on professional autonomy
and accountability. Citizens see most of the issues as
organizational, created by government decision-makers and, therefore,
capable of being changed by those same government decision-makers.  
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">To close the gap
between what Islanders want and what the Province provides; Education
20/20 Inc. recommends that:</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br />

</p>
<ol>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in">As an
	immediate step, Government engage in the development of a short,
	clear, overarching, public statement about education, who it is for,
	its guiding principles and basic beliefs.  Although much has been
	written about education, a comprehensive vision statement does not
	currently exist for PEI. We believe that having such a statement is
	required, especially for a service as large and complex as
	education, however, we are not suggesting another study but rather a
	document prepared by a small working with opportunity for citizen
	input.</p></li>
</ol>
<p style="margin-left: 0.75in; margin-bottom: 0in">
<br />

</p>
<ol start="2">
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Develop a
	learner centered service model that provides support in all domains
	to learners as, when and where needed.  Doing so would involve
	student centered outcomes, criterion referenced assessment, flexible
	scheduling, challenge for credit arrangements, and greater autonomy
	and accountability for teachers. 
	</p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Government
	reserve for itself a leadership role in creating a learning culture
	and providing a quality education for every Islander.  Such a role
	is important but currently lacking, and education suffers as a
	result. Government should  focus on matters of planning, setting
	priorities, funding, monitoring, quality control, ensuring the
	availability of professional resources, home support for preschool
	children,  information and continuing education. Under such an
	arrangement, the Department may well play an increased role in
	delivering support to families with pre- school children, more
	active role in promoting and offering continuing education classes
	and even in providing information and services to children and their
	parents.</p></li>
</ol>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br />

</p>
<ol start="4">
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Government
	delegate the role of providing instruction; actual provision of
	instruction to be expanded beyond schools, colleges, universities to
	include community agencies, professionals in private practice and
	learners themselves. 
	</p></li>
</ol>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br />

</p>
<ol start="5">
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Establish
	a qualification authority, a separate body for the purpose
	certifying individual levels of achievement to persons wanting or
	needing such documentation.  The role of teaching is to help others
	learn; when a teachers rank their students they are putting their
	ability to teach at risk; assigning student grades, selecting
	students for prizes and awards and awarding diplomas and degrees is
	a sorting process and should not be part of a teacher’s role. 
	Apprenticeship with certification through a Provincial Department of
	Labour and music through the Royal Canadian Music conservatory are
	examples of the preferred arrangement.  
	</p></li>
</ol>
<p style="margin-left: 0.75in; margin-bottom: 0in"><br />

</p>
<ol start="6">
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Take steps
	to establish a more professional model of service delivery such as
	in health and justice services, where professionals are directly
	accountable to clients for the nature, extent and quality of service
	provided.  Such a model must include closer professional-client
	relationship than now exist, the potential for a family education
	adviser for those who want it, and professional autonomy and
	accountability.</p></li>
