</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Formal remarks prepared for a reception honoring The Community Foundation of Prince Edward Island on August 31, 2011. Acknowledges hosts Tim and Kathy Upson. Discusses the history and value of community foundations, noting that the first was established over a century ago, with major growth in recent decades (approximately 175 now exist in Canada). Explains how community foundations allow charitable donors to manage charitable interests through a single foundation account, reducing costs and administrative overhead compared to establishing private charities. Emphasizes the Foundation&#x27;s mandate to assist and stimulate caring Islanders in delivering charitable interests. Demonstrates Don&#x27;s leadership voice and institutional philosophy regarding philanthropy.</div>

<div class="reader-content">
<p>Hello, thanks &amp; intro and greetings as required</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>It’s my pleasure to Acknowledge and thank Tim and Kathy Upson for hosting today’s Reception to recognize the support to, and contributions of, The Community Foundation of Prince Edward.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>-----------</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Although the first community foundation was established more than one hundred years ago, and there are now about 175 in Canada, their major growth has taken place in the last couple of decades as people realized that they, in effect, can use their own charitable account at a Community Foundation to deliver their charitable interests, at less cost and without the administrative headaches of having their own private charity.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Our mandate at the Foundation is to assist &amp; stimulate caring Islanders in the delivery of their charitable giving, both now and in the years to come. We are in the business of connecting people who care with causes that matter. Most charitable organizations ask for donations for their specific cause. Community foundations ask donors about their charitable interests and find a way to support them.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Donor interests empower us to support a wide range of worthy causes on an ongoing basis. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>		This year, for example,</p>
<p>In <span>health care</span>, we’ve helped a Souris area seniors club purchase a defibrillator; given scholarships in healthcare for people living and working<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>in Eastern Kings; assisted with establishing a cardiac awareness center in Tryon, made a donation to the PCH Maternal Child Care Unit; and as well as to the QEH &amp; PCH Foundations</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>In <span>education</span>, we made donations to support library and music programs in a number of Island schools, and we’ve provided scholarships for Island students to honor the work of Canada games organizers Orin Carver and Joseph Spriet, and of the late Senator Lorne Bonnell, and of Joan Auld, and of the Summerside Natick Friendship Hockey tournament, and for three students to go off Island to further their education in Architecture.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>In <span>community projects</span> we’ve supported the Boys &amp; Girls Club programs in Summerside, day camps for special children on the Appin Road, watershed improvement projects in Tryon, the Upper Room Food Bank in Charlottetown, and even planted flowers in the Joseph Ghiz Memorial Park</p>
<p>For <span>cultural organizations</span>, we assisted donors in the delivery of donations to IRF, VPI, Confed. Centre, and the Singing Strings and to a number of churches. We’re also pleased to report that another significant donation has been made to the IRF endowment which was set up to fund future church maintenance needs, and we look forward to it being matched by the Federal Government’s National Heritage program.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>For <span>seniors, </span>we’ve provided information materials and sessions designed to help seniors deal with health care, estate planning, and other issues.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>How can we do all this!!</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Donors make a gift to the Foundation; In return, they receive a tax receipt, and depending on the donor’s wishes, the Foundation either:</p>
<p><br></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li1"><span>Places the gift in a permanent endowment</span>:<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We invest the money, it grows, and we use the earnings to make grants to the causes specified by the donor, year after year, in perpetuity, or</li>
  <li class="li1"><span>We flow the donation through to another non-profit as directed by the donor.</span> Folks use our flow through services to take advantage of our granting expertize, or to get a US Tax receipt, or to use our gift-of-securities service, or because they wish to remain anonymous, or to make several smaller gifts from one large gift, etc</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p>Although the Foundation has awarded more than $1 million to PEI non-profit organizations since its inception less than 20 years ago, each year we become even more aware of the unmet needs throughout the Island. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Last fall, the Board of Directors decided to reposition the Foundation by Making a Quantum Leap to raise annual granting for donor causes from $70,000 to $250,000 within 5 years.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Your Foundation has departed on an ambitious campaign of building partnerships in the private and public sector, raising our awareness level with the general public, and identifying strategies to effect positive change in PEI communities<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Much of the money needed to support the day to day costs of delivering our programs and services comes from the modest Administration Fee we charge on our endowments. And we also rely on an annual fund raiser, and the generosity of our landlord, auditors, legal advisors, internet providers and private individuals and corporations. We have determined that we will need to increase our endowment fund portfolio from $1 ½ million to $5 million to allow us to be self-sufficient in the delivery of our programs and services at our new level.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>We have a good sense of where these funds will come from. And to ensure that your Foundation will have sufficient funds to provide for the delivery of our programs and services during our 5 year repositioning phase, we launched a “Securing our Future” campaign and many of you here have already been invited to join one of our “Circles of Friends”!<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>We have been overwhelmed by the response you and others have made. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>In particular, I am pleased that several of you here this afternoon have already joined me in the “President’s Circle” by pledging between $1,000 and $5,000 per year for 5 years.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I am also very pleased to recognize the decision by the Credit Union branches of PEI to join our Circle of Friends at the “Community Circle” level by contributing $5000 annually for 5 years. We can think of no other organization that parallels our involvement in communities all across the Island<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>There is still room for others to join one of our circles and I’d be happy to discuss the opportunities privately later.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>In addition to the launch of our Securing Our Future Campaign we have had the honour to administer a number of new funds this year, they are (expound as time allows):<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Cheryl and Dr. Harry Callaghan Pediatric Fund (assist with the costs associated with children going out of Province for medical treatment)</p>
<p>Thomas and Betty Hall Endowment Trust (provide a wide range of non-profit support and scholarships)</p>
<p>David (Jiggs) MacDonald and Gerry Rutten Music Legacy Fund (support community music programs), and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The HRH Duke and Duchess of Cambridge Legacy Fund (provide scholarships and support for causes of interest to the Royal Couple).</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>(Refer to brochure which will be included with a hand out for everyone as they leave, explain fund types if time permits and mention the Board)</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>And we can do this only because of the work of our Board of Directors, the dedication of our staff, Marla and Jeniene, and our many volunteers, and supporters like Tim &amp; Kathy.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>As I said at the beginning, we are in the business of connecting people who care with causes that matter.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We represent the donor. Our causes are our donor’s causes. What kind of future do you want for your community? What do you want the Island to be like 50 or 100 years from now? What legacy are you leaving for future generations?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Perhaps we should talk about how your Community Foundation can help?</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Thanks to hosts, attendees, etc (Reminder about hand-out on departure)</p>
