  x21 Should schools sort
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">A revised and refined version of the &quot;Sort.doc&quot; essay, presenting Don&#x27;s arguments about credentialing with improved structure and clarity. The document addresses the same themes: questioning credential usefulness in determining actual competence, criticizing how institutions pre-determine curricula limiting student choice, highlighting the disconnect between institutional criteria and occupational standards, and emphasizing schools&#x27; dual role as teaching institutions and sorting mechanisms. The revision demonstrates Don&#x27;s iterative approach to developing his ideas for publication or presentation, suggesting this was an important argument he wanted to communicate effectively to education stakeholders.</div>

<p><b>21 Should schools sort?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Canadians like credentials. Places of work, whether they be trade, technical or professional, often display credentials of people who work there. I am not sure if such displays are intended to impress or intimidate. Many of credentials I encounter are issued by universities although some a few are issued by professional and technical associations.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Such displays tell about some life choices that bearers have made such as where they went to school, the level of schooling they attained, and maybe some specialized courses they have taken.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>. Presumably they are placed in a conspicuous location to support the notion that the bearer, and the person providing you service, is competent to provide the service you are waiting for.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>As the user of services provided by an establishment, I put this information in the category of interesting but not very useful. That is not to downplay the sweat equity people put into the acquisition of diplomas and degrees but seldom do the items on display tell me about the competence of the person about to serve me.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>To qualify for a degree, diploma or certificate a person follows a pre-set program of studies<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>determined by the institution, or an instructor in the institution, who may, or may not, have worked outside the institution, or of if he has, he did so many years earlier.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In addition, the criteria may or may not reflect the criteria in the field or occupation in which the learner is preparing.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Assessment is conducted by the institution, students are sorted by the institution, credentials are awarded based on which has a very limited opportunity for individual choice with the result that most students aiming for a diploma or degree having little opportunity to explore ideas of particular interest. Whiled these credentials do not guarantee anything, they do indicate that the holder followed a course of instruction much like that followed by a similar holder from a similar institution anywhere in Canada.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>They are awarded based on study of selected components of a variety of disciplines.</p>

<p>Certificate are usually more specific. Some only certify that the holder has taken a course of a set duration, others may inform the reader that the person has successfully completed a course, while still others may provide some information about the level of achievement.</p>
<p>Transcripts, which are a form of certificate, provide a "mark" for each subject studied each year.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>/</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>In my role as an employer, I cannot ever remember asking for or receiving a copy of a degree or diploma as part of the assessment process; I did, however, find transcripts quite useful.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>While everybody has their pet peeves about the education system, the complaints I hear usually are about:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>· Communication skills · Math/science skills · Canadian history or geography · Work habits and attitudes</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Our current approach to credentialing seems not to address these concerns.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>It is unlikely that we can or should prevent educational institutions from awarding credentials. Based on my own experience and in talking with employers, I question if credentials now offered really serve the public and student needs.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>On reflection, one is left with three questions. What credentials do we need and why?</p>
<p>Who should award the credentials we need? On what basis should they be awarded?</p>
<p><br></p>

<p><br></p>
<p>, also, the holders in their graduation exuberance had had the certificates framed and needed a place to hang them.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Teachers teach and schools, where most teaching occurs, sort those who are taught.</p>
<p>Given the apparent confusion between schooling and teaching, this gives schools a key role in determining what will be taught, to whom and when. Most of this occurs while we are young, The sorting function in particular, I believe, has a major impact, much of ",'" /, it negative, on life later choices available to our youth</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Good's Dictionary of Education defines a credential as "a certificate stating that a student has graduated from a certain curriculum or has passed certain subjects with indicated marks". Credentials come with a variety of labels. Most sought after and recognized, I believe would be a university degree, which until recently could only be awarded by a university but now are awarded by some community colleges. The awarding of diplomas follows the same lines but are not as highly regulated and usually involve 2-3 years of study.</p>
