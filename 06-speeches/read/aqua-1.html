  AQUA-1
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">An August 26, 2005 draft proposal for AQUA with comprehensive background, concept development, and implementation framework. Don&#x27;s detailed background explains that education and certification are separate functions incorrectly conflated through institutional delivery. The concept proposes an independent, private sector-driven body with authority to assess and certify performance on tasks found in occupations or fields. Characteristics include independent governance, fee-for-service operation, direct or referral-based client acceptance, performance-based certification, provision of competency gap information, and extensive use of advisory panels. Benefits explicitly address removing certification barriers, focusing certification on performance, encouraging self-study, separating teaching and certification functions, and eliminating time as a certification factor. Implementation includes four sequential steps, demonstrating Don&#x27;s systematic approach to innovation.</div>

<p><br></p>
<p><b>ATLANTIC PROVINCES QUALIFICATION AUTHORITY</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Background</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>The acquiring of an education and the certification of qualifications are two separate functions although the two are closely linked and frequently one is thought to be the other.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The fact that the delivery of both functions is, to a large degree, provided or driven by educational institutions often works to the individual’s disadvantage in terms of both education and certification.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>While separate certification bodies exist, they appear to place undue emphasis on results of study and too little emphasis on what has been learned outside the formal education system.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Concept</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The idea behind this proposal is to establish an independent, private sector driven body with authority to assess and certify a person’s level of performance on a task or set of tasks such as found in an occupation or field.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Characteristics</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>AQUA will:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Be an independent organization with its own governing structure</p>
<p>Operate on a fee for service basis</p>
<p>Accept clients on direct application or by referral</p>
<p>Issue certificates based on demonstrated performance</p>
<p>On request, provide applicants with information on gaps to be filled to meet certification requirements.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Make extensive use of advisory/working panels.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Benefits/Advantages</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>It is anticipated that the availability of AQUA will:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Remove barriers to certification encountered in the current approach</p>
<p>Focus certification more clearly on performance</p>
<p>Encourage more self study</p>
<p>Allow educational providers to focus on the teaching function</p>
<p>Allow a certification body to focus on certification without regard to teaching.</p>
<p>Removes length of learning time as a component of certification</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Implementation Steps</b><b></b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Undertake feasibility study</p>
<p>Prepare a business plan</p>
<p>Conduct a pilot of the model</p>
<p>3	Implement the service</p>
