  6- structural
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">An editor&#x27;s letter or public essay examining structural issues in PEI&#x27;s education system. Defines education as helping people change how they think, feel, and act; outlines six life roles and seven essential education services. Argues that government embedding of education services restricts professional autonomy and suggests education needs broader community engagement and clearer purpose definitions.</div>

<p><b>Issues in public education</b></p>
<p><b>Guardian</b></p>
<p><b>	For some time now, I have engaged Islanders in conversations about public education, learning paths, continuing education, citizen math, curriculum development, professional autonomy and accountability, politicization, transition to employment and the list goes on.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b>	My own view of education is quite simple.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Learning is a very personal matter and is about people changing the way they think, feel and act; education is about people helping<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>other people change the way they think, feel or act and a good education is about developing skills, knowledge and attitudes needed to function as a member of a democracy. The role of the state is to encourage, support and regulate education; it also usse education as a tool to grow and maintain Prince Edward Island as a place we will continue to call home. My search of the literature reveals that<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>typically, Islanders fill six life roles: individual, citizen, family member, learner, consumer and producer and<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>that, typically an education system provides the following services: instruction, human resources, learning products and technology, , information and counselling, funding, quality control and governance. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li1"><b>Governance &amp; leadership: </b>leadership, liaison, support, research, advocacy; quality assurance.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li1"><b>Instruction: </b>presentation, demonstration, practice, diagnosis, coaching, record keeping, guided practice</li>
  <li class="li1"><b>Learning products and technology: texts and references, self-instructional material , assistive technologies, internet, software, moocs</b></li>
  <li class="li1"><b>Human resources: teachers, administrators, teaching assistants, specialists, guidance counsellors</b></li>
  <li class="li1"><b>Quality assurance</b>: credentials, qualifications, proficiency level</li>
  <li class="li1"><b>Funding: capital, operating</b>: transportation</li>
  <li class="li1"><b>Information and counselling</b>: information, counselling, assessment, diagnosis, referral. advocacy, promotion</li>
</ul>
<p><b>ducation shares many of the criticism of other large organizations; But the unexpected finding in my exploration is the lack of engagement of education with the community it serves. For example, program advisory no public or employer representatives on program advisory committees, minimal information on student report cards, unwillingness to delegate signifivant functions or authority to professional educators. tendency to seek outside expertise in decision-making, depth of Ministerial involvement in school decision-making. lack of concern for citizens’ need or desire to know about education matters. Whereas I may simply ascribe it as questionable management practices others see it as a lack of confidence or lack of trust. These things also give credence to the fear factor often ascribed to public education</b></p>
<p><b>Based on my exploration, I attribute weaknesses in our education to<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>the nature and extent to which education services are embedded within<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>government. While government has a major role to plam, we need tto find a way to let it do its own thing. While friends in the medical profession also complain about the health bureaucracy, it is my view that health professionals have rertained a professional quality moreso that education.</b></p>
<p><b>	Difficult yeara ahead.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Education and educators need to be encouraged and allowed to broaden their vision and It is likely that this embedment is the cause of some<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>my well be that the It is the structure of those services that causes my concern.</b></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li1"><b>Department of Education literature<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>leads me to believe that, in the Department’s view, education and schooling are one and the same. For example, the Department includes<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>both “education and lifelong learning in the title, the role is given as one of “developing and delivering <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>. A more adequate description, I suggest, would be to “ help Islanders to gain skills, knowledge. attitudes needed to function as a citizen in a democracy..<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is not only clear but is measurable as well.</b></li>
  <li class="li1"><b></b></li>
  <li class="li1"><b>It seems to me that the Department has a responsibility to encourage the rest 0of us to continue our education as well.</b></li>

<p><b>. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b>I’ve heard this before thought this for some time but recent reports by the OECD, World Bank, reform in Australia, etc. encouraged me to speak out.</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>My exploration reveals an interest in the subject, recognition of its importance but uncertainty about whether the education provided is the education we most need</b></p>
<p><b>IThe nub of education’s problem, in my view, lies in differing views as to what constitutes education; the lack of a clear definition and purpose results in poor planning, distorts the operational system, reduces our ability to grant authority and apply accountability. For example, the current statement of role by the Department of Education<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
