  2007-1 Robertson, Mark
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">A memorandum (SD-2007-2) dated August 21, 2007, documenting Don&#x27;s discussion with Mark Robertson regarding potential involvement with CFPEI. The memo outlines areas where the foundation needed support: editor of community reporter, media releases, brochure preparation, information sessions, electronic newsletter editing, and presentations to professional advisors. Don notes Robertson&#x27;s impression of a recent board presentation and his willingness to serve on a development committee. The memo demonstrates Don&#x27;s systematic approach to volunteer recruitment and board development, his ability to identify organizational needs, and his skill at matching individuals with opportunities where they can contribute.</div>

<p><b>COMMUNITY FOUNDATION OF PRINCE EDWARD ISLAND</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>SD-2007-2</b></p>
<p><b>Date:		August 21, 2007</b></p>
<p><b>Prepared by:	Don Glendenning</b></p>

<p><b>Subject;	Discussions with Mark Robertson</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I had coffee yesterday with Mark Robertson to talk about our mutual interests in CFPEI; in particular,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I identified the following as areas of need:<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Editor of community Reporter, media releases, preparation of brochures, community information sessions, Editor of the electronic newsletter, presentations to professional advisors, etc. and wondered if any areas were of interest.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>He mentioned that he had accompanied John to a presentation last spring and was impressed with John’s presentation.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He also mentioned that, I think, he had met with John and Myron about presentations to professional advisors and he had gathered a few names but not made presentations.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He also said that he would be willing to be a member of a Development committee but not a chair.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Hhe awaits a specific request from us.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I suggest the following:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>That CFPEI identify community presentations yet this year in such places as Wellington, Kensington and Cardigan as one of our information priorities and that Mark be asked to work with appropriate directors to make it happen<span>.</span></p>
<p>That we designate director(s) to work with Mark in making presentations to the professional advisors he has identified.</p>
<p>early in the new year, we review the matter and make other plans<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>based on our experience.</p>
