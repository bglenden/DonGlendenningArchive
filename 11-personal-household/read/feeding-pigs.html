  Feeding pigs
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Don recalls the labor-intensive pig-feeding process: a dedicated shed near the house contained a large brick-based cooker (approximately 6 by 3 by 1.5 feet) where turnips and potatoes were boiled. The process involved cooking, mashing in 10-quart pails with meal, then carrying to the barn. Don vividly remembers the pungent aroma of cooking turnips and a painful childhood incident where he slipped on wet snow and rammed his arm into a hot pot of potatoes, leaving a burn mark visible for years.</div>

<p><b>Feeding the pigs</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>We always kept a few pigs at our place and it seems to me that we spent all of our time feeding them.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They often got a mixture of oats, barley and bran (just like seniors and their bran flakes). And of course either water or milk depending on the age of the pigs and any surplus milk.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In addition, a favourite at our place was either cooked potatoes or turnips. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>There was an old shed just outside our back door – probably 10 to 15 feet from the house.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was not large – perhaps 8 by 12 feet and inside was a huge cooker.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I am not sure what the pot was made from but I think that it was probably 6 feet long and maybe three feet wide and 15 to 16 inches deep.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As a kid, it seemed very large to me.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was set on a brick base so that a fire could be lighted under it.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Turnips were dumped into the tub, water was added, the turnips were cooked.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We likely cooked potatoes there as well abut I only remember the turnips.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Cooking took a lot wood, which was hauled, to the shed on a hand sled.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When finished, potatoes were put into a 10-quart pail, meal was added and the turnips were mashed by pushing a stick, a piece of stove wood from the woodpile, down into the pail.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When the turnips cooled, they were carried to the barn and emptied into the pig’s trough. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Readers who eat turnip will know the strong aroma; imagine cooking large quantities several times a week in a building only used for that purpose.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>By the way, the old cook shed was torn down in the early 1940’s when John built a garage for our 1939 Ford truck.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Sometimes potatoes were cooked on the kitchen stove for the same purpose.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A huge pot of potatoes would be boiled and the process would be repeated as with turnips.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>At our house the kitchen stove was more or less at one end of the kitchen and the back door was reached through a little room at the other end.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I remember once, a pot of hot potatoes hot off the stove was sitting on the floor near the back door.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was winter; the floor was wet from snow being carried in on many feet.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I was heading for the back door<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>- presumably running, slipped and rammed my arm into the hot pot of potatoes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>For years the burn mark could be seen on my forearm.</p>
