  500 WHAT an A
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Don questions what &quot;A&quot; grades actually signify, noting schools apply such labels despite no evidence they meaningfully describe student capability. He contrasts educational grading with medical assessment: doctors use specific measurements (weight, blood pressure, PSA levels) without averaging across categories to inform clinical judgment, while teachers average unrelated subjects&#x27; grades. Don sought written explanations of what constitutes an &quot;A&quot; from schools with minimal success, finding transcripts unhelpful. He argues an &quot;A&quot; should clearly define performance—does it mean writing clearly, having superior vocabulary, speaking logically? If so, say so; if not, what does it mean? He provides examples: a plumber who solves problems independently, a writer using creative expression with proper grammar, a technician understanding deep processes. People deserve to know what grade labels mean, and employers need such clarity for hiring decisions.</div>

<p><b>WHAT’’S AN A?</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>An “A” is a high mark; the only better one would be A+, AA, AAA, or even AAAA. The top students in school, college or university are the “A” students.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>People weren’t born “A” students; or if they were, they were not labeled as such.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>While parents may think they have a smart child, no parent I know would refer to their child an A, B or C child.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is only after children start school that they become so classified; schools like labels, I guess.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The school system often applies other labels as well, or instead of, letters; they may also give students a GPA. Number or even a figure ranging from zero to one hundred.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>A student may earn an A on a single assignment, all assignments, on projects or an exam or even a subject studied for a whole year.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A student who earns an A on all subjects is known as a “straight A” student.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Many students get a mixture of A’s, B’s, C’s, D’s, and even F’s.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Schools often average student's marks for a year although the logic of averaging marks on such diverse subjects as math, social studies, science and physical education continues to elude me. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The health system also uses numbers when determining the state of a person’s health.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>During a recent visit, my doctor quoted such figures as 170 pounds, 120 over 70 blood pressure, pulse of 72 and figures for PSA, cholesterol, etc.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>None of these numbers required judgment; all were based on tests.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>With figures in hand, and without averaging my test results, my doctor proceeded with judgments about my current state of health; I am happy to report that there were no major changes - either improvements or deteriorations.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I am intrigued by the differences in the ways the two systems deals with their information about the individuals they serve.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A doctor uses the numbers to determine the state of a person’s health (no averaging of tests from different specialties); a teacher assigns numbers to announce the level of one’s knowledge of a field.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I made some enquiries of schools as to the meaning of an A in education and, in fact asked for written information; none was forthcoming.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Some parents showed me recent transcripts which I found interesting but not very informative.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I tried to search the internet but, not being very skilled, had little success in finding what constitutes an A.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I have trouble interpreting the meaning of an A.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Oh, I know that it represents a judgment call by a teacher as to how well a student knows a subject<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>- but it doesn’t tell me much about what a student can do with what he knows.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Take Language Arts, for example, does having an A mean that the person writes clearly and logically, has a greater vocabulary than most other students, speaks well and with logic?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If so, why not say so? If not, what does an A mean?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It requires a definition.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Information like this would be especially useful to employers.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>In my notes and papers, I found a number of statements which I believe describe an A level of performance.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Unfortunately, I do not know their sources.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>An “A” level:</p>
<p>Plumber is a person who is able, on his own, to generally repairs or replaces my domestic plumbing while dealing with most unexpected problems during the process.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Writer is a person who is able to write creatively using acceptable standards of grammar, sentence structure and organization.</p>
<p>Chemical technician is a person who has a deep understanding of the process and can complete all important parts.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Speaker is a person who is able to communicate well, think concretely and abstractly, and analyze and interpret data.</p>
<p>Team member<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>is a person who is able to consistently assess own behaviour and adjust to maximize group performance, stay on task, contributes useful ideas and defends them when appropriate, uses personal strengths effectively, assumes various roles, accepts a group perspective, participates without prompting.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>“What’s an A?” is a reasonable question.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Those being labeled deserve to know what it means.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The rest of us need help with interpreting it in every day life.</p>
