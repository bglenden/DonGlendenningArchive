<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><b>BACKGROUND</b></p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><br />

</p>
<p align="justify" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Our
future as individuals and as communities depends to a large degree on
the quality of our education.  Gaining a quality education,
therefore, should be a major focus of every citizen, providing a
quality education should be the focus of governments, and providing a
quality education the objective of every teacher and school.  An
award is for having done something done rather than a grant to do
something.  
</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><br />

</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Thanks to the
generosity of an Island family, Education 20/20 Inc. has established
an awards program as a mechanism to call attention by the public to
important characteristics of effective schools and to provide some
recognition to schools for their efforts to implement them.  The
focus of the award is on engagement for, as the National Parent
Teacher Association points out that “when families, schools, and
communities work together student achievement improves, teacher
morale rises and communication increases”. Study after study show
the dramatic impact parental involvement makes to a child's success
in school. In fact, engaging families in their children’s education
improves school achievement, attendance, behaviour and graduation
rates.  The focus will be on the daily operation of the school and on
those items over which the school has substantial control.

</p>
<ul>
	<li><p align="justify" style="line-height: 100%; orphans: 0; margin-bottom: 0in; widows: 0">
	<b>Learning environment </b>should be welcoming  and one that is
	safe and comfortable physically and emotionally, based on the
	assumptions of respect, cultural competency, trust, care, optimism
	and intentionality.  School encourages integration of learning
	<i>across </i>courses and invites students to discuss “big
	questions” that matter beyond the classroom.    Teacher encourages
	critical inquiry, writing, research, collaborative learning and
	other skills that develop students' intellectual and practical
	skills. Teacher ensures he/she is on leading edge of current
	teaching practices and technology so as to better prepare students'
	for 21<sup>st</sup> century learning</p></li>

	insights of others especially those from different backgrounds and

	<b>School Community Partnerships</b>: Experiential learning with
	community partners is an instructional strategy and can be made part
	of a course. This involves direct experience with issues they are
	studying in the curriculum. The opportunity to learn, analyze
	information, and be a participant in community setting also
	reinforces the idea of good citizenship, i.e. giving back to the
	community. Other examples of student/community partnership may
