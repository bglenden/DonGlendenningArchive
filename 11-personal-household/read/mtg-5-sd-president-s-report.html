<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li3">We now have a website, www.caneducation2020.com with an Email address of don@caneducation.com</li>
  <li class="li3">Henry Purdy agreed to provide us with possible logos</li>
  <li class="li3">I opened a bank account at Metro Credit Union and made application for a credit card in the name of the company with statements going to company mailing address</li>
  <li class="li3">I picked up the official Minute book from Margaret Anne</li>
  <li class="li3">Requested a meeting with Imelda Arsenault and colleagues and identified reading and challenge for credit as two areas of interest; no response as of time of preparing this report.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Obviously, I would be delighted if you can attend.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I expect that Tom Hall will be interested in attending.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It would be good to have a small group to meet<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>on a regular basis.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Need discussion.</li>
  <li class="li3">Had a brief conversation with Barb MacNutt and Audrey Penner about a meeting to discuss reading.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Would like to discuss how we handle meetings of this kind</li>
  <li class="li3">Need to make plans for our annual meeting</li>
  <li class="li3">I had asked Bill Whelan and Maureen Kerr for comments about the “engagement software.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Their responses were:</li>
</ul>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li6">Maureen: Merry Christmas! I did have a look and it appears similar to a project management software program I'm familiar with called Basecamp. I'd say it would be useful once you started to scale your organization and have to project manage more than a handful of people. I'd be happy to go through it with you in person if you'd like.</li>
  <li class="li7">I reviewed ThoughtStream and I think it appears to be an excellent way<br>
to gather, organize and prioritize information from individuals in an<br>
organization. The interactive site is user friendly and easy to use. I<br>
really like the capability to group thoughts into major areas as part of<br>
a convergence exercise, and then allow the group members to prioritize<br>
ideas. The key utility of this software is to provide for a more focused<br>
and efficient discussion when the group gets together face-to-face (eg<br>
all the pre-work up have been completed in ThoughtStream). Hence the<br>
group can focus on solutions/strategies moving forward for the top<br>
ideas. And the price is very reasonable.</li>
