  A Wilmot-1
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Draft emails from Don to Louise and Jim Wilmot regarding the Souris Garden Club project. Don indicates strong support for the garden initiative, noting that he and Jeniene believe it merits promotion beyond Souris boundaries. He requests Sarah and Ilse prepare budget scenarios for three funding levels ($2,500, $3,500, $5,000) to support the project. Don mentions discovering matching fund opportunities that could expand project scope. The correspondence demonstrates Don&#x27;s collaborative leadership style, his ability to identify funding mechanisms, and his strategic thinking about scaling successful community programs. The personal tone and optimistic outlook show his enthusiasm for educational innovation.</div>

<p><b>Draft Email to Wilmots</b></p>
<p>Just a a brief note to let you know that Jeniene and I met yesterday to discuss the Souris Garden Club.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We agree that it is a good project and deserves support?  In fact, we are of the view that the model should be promoted beyond the boundaries of Souris<br>
<br>
We are asking Sarah and Ilse to provide bit more detail and to do provide for three levels of support, say$2500, $3,500 and $5,000; if this does not match your thinking, please advise.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We will work with Sarah and Ilse and be back in touch. </p>
<p>Thanks to Jeniene, we've discovered the possibility of matching funds; if that were to happen, we probably could all that they have in mind plus more.</p>
<p>We’ll keep you posted; trust all is well</p>
<p>Regards</p>
<p>Don  <br>
</p>
<p><b>Draft Email to Ilse and Sarah</b></p>
<p>We are optimistic that some funds can be found to help move your project along.  To do so, we need a bit more information.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Would you provide a page or so, not too long, outlining what you would do in 2017  with $2,500, $3,500 and $5,000.  We think that the project may be of interest to other communities and, if you agree, would like you to consider an additional component, that of making a presentation about  your project elsewhere in PEI.<br>
<br>
Feel free to share any drafts you prepare (copy to Jeniene); we are happy to work with you in developing your proposals.</p>
<p>Regards</p>
<p>Don</p>
