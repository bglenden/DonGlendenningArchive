  100 Math
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">A comprehensive May 2020 discussion paper prepared by Education 20/20 Inc. addressing numeracy education on PEI. Based on the 2013 Community Foundation PEI survey and six public discussions, the paper defines math and numeracy, reviews international evidence, identifies systemic fragmentation, and proposes 16+ recommendations including competency-based frameworks, independent rating scales, and learner profiles. Demonstrates Don&#x27;s systematic approach to policy research combining empirical evidence, stakeholder input, and organizational reform principles.</div>

<p><span>In late 2013, The Community Foundation of Prince Edward Island (CFPEI) undertook a survey of over 200 Island youth to identify issues that directly affected them; the report, T</span><span>aking the Pulse of Island Youth</span><span>, available on the Foundation’s website at www.cfpei.ca, provides a snapshot of the findings.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span></span>Bright spots include a positive sense of community, emerging entrepreneurial spirit, volunteerism and new postsecondary offerings. The main concerns include a lack of jobs, surviving on low-paying jobs, educational deficiencies and drug and alcohol addictions.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>On the subject of education and learning, the study reports a high rate of completion of high school and postsecondary education, a high level of inclusivity and relatively affordable tuition costs; young people also expressed concerns about their readiness for the next stage of life including:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p><b><i>postsecondary study and the workplace” </i></b><b>– Vital Signs, CFPEI, 2013</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>Following the publication of the CFPEI Report, Education 20/20 organized six public discussions for the purpose of informing the community about the report and its findings, learning more about youth issues in our communities, exploring issues of education and learning, and to identify actions to be taken to close gaps.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Discussions were lively and wide ranging and carried on well after formal sessions ended. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Education 20/20 retained an interest in the subject and continued its exploration through informal discussion with educators, employers, students and the community at large.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p><b>EDUCATION</b></p>
<p><b>Consistent decision making requires a set of basic beliefs about learners and learning; this paper is based on the view that:</b></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li13"><b>Learning is an individual matter</b></li>
  <li class="li13"><b>Although groups do not learn, individuals may learn in a group setting. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></li>
  <li class="li13"><b>Learning results in a change of behaviour.</b></li>
  <li class="li13"><b>The role of a teacher is to help students change behaviour;</b></li>
  <li class="li13"><b>People are educated whether or not they attend school</b></li>
  <li class="li13"><b>Education should emphasize achievement not time spent or served<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></li>
  <li class="li13"><b>Grading is not a teaching function and probably not an educational function.</b></li>
  <li class="li13"><b>High school graduation implies sufficient math to cope as a citizen in every day life</b></li>
</ul>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>MATH</b></p>
<p><b>Mathematics is the study of the science of number, quantity and space; it is in demand to some degree by all citizens,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>employers, institutions and the community at large. The Oregon Department of Education contends that math provides “a foundation for the study of science and technology as well as the interpretation of quantitative information in other subjects. Mathematics may be structured in a number of ways but structure does not appear to have a particular influence on the quality of instruction. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Math is an essential skill needed to some level by all citizens and can be learned to the citizen level by all or practically all Islanders.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Furthermore, helping citizens acquire math skills for citizenship is one of the key roles of our public-school system but there appears to be no agreement, however, as to the nature and level of citizen math and how it should be determined.</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Numeracy </b>is also mathematics,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>the application tof mathematics to solve problems in every day life.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Being numerate has been described as “having the confidence and skill to use numbers and mathematical approaches in all aspects of life – at work, in practical every day activities<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>at home and beyond, as consumers in managing our finances, as parents helping our children learn, as patients making sense of health information, and as citizens understanding the world about us.”</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>And<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>there are some changes on the horizon:</b></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li13"><b>Format changes being adopted by the MPHEC.</b></li>
  <li class="li13"><b>General trend towards competency-based education</b></li>
  <li class="li13"><b>Emergence of dynamic/ holistic rating scales,</b></li>
  <li class="li13"><b>Changing learning platforms</b></li>
</ul>
<p><b>•	Upgrading of schools.</b></p>
<p><b>•	Independent qualification authorities.</b></p>
<p><b>•	Learner profiles<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b>•	Education as a life long service.</b></p>

<p><b>MATH ISSUES</b></p>
<p><b>1.	Communication, coordination and collaboration among stakeholders</b></p>
<p><b>2.	Curriculum development model</b></p>

<p><b>CONCLUSIONS</b></p>
<p>Based on the literature, the above noted discussions and the writer’s experience, the writer concludes that:</p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li13">Math instruction in PEI is fragmented</li>
  <li class="li13">Cooperation among providers is hampered by the lack of agreed- upon definitions of a number of key concepts.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li13">Broadly speaking, education lacks an overarching statement of philosophy and direction;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li13">There is no formal mechanism for coordination among math providers</li>
  <li class="li13">Evaluation criteria for math should be the same for all levels of education.</li>
  <li class="li13">Improving transition requires cooperation of all math instruction providers.</li>
  <li class="li13">There is an interest among math providers in cooperating on a pilot project</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>RECOMMENDATIONS:</b></p>
<p><b>Based on our exploration, Education 2020 recommends:</b></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li13">An over-arching statement of beliefs and principles</li>
  <li class="li13">Numeracy be offered as a separate subject on PEI</li>
