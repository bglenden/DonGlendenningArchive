<div class="reader-summary">A working draft essay restating Don&#x27;s core critique: PEI&#x27;s education system is narrowly focused on school delivery, lacks direction, and prevents necessary systemic change. He defines education broadly as &quot;any experience that has a formative effect on the way a person thinks, feels or acts&quot; and calls for government to &quot;encourage, support and regulate&quot; rather than directly deliver. Proposes adopting competency-based learning, dynamic rating scales, and democratic school governance. Includes detailed outline of current problems, responsibility gaps, and OECD recommendations.</div>

<p><b>Editor</b></p>
<p><b>Time for an overhaul</b></p>
<p><b>Education services on PEI need an overhaul; they are narrowly focused, cognitively based, bureaucratic, lack accountability and focus on program delivery rather than on learner development – they also lack a self-correcting mechanism.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I do not, we cannot, blame the current government, the previous government or any single government that went before for the current status; Government has a responsibility however, for instituting corrective measures. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b>There is a growing gap between education services needed and education services provided.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b>Islanders want our students to be literate and numerate, to become independent learners, to take care of themselves and learn how to work and play together. Education’s business is to help Islanders gain new and better skills, knowledge, attitudes and values.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We wonder if<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>our students would benefit from holistic rating scales, competency based learning, self- paced programs and schools operating on democratic principles.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>W know that money is needed for buses. buildings, salaries and technology but tell us how spending those dollars improves education. The conversation is bogged down on matters of administrivia (school upgrading, credits, grades, noon meals, technology, etc.) at the expense of changes that<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>help Islanders gain knowledge, skills, attitudes and values needed to help them to thrive in later life.</b></p>
<p><b>It is the writer’s view that much of the needed change is blocked by an outdated<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>system; we’ve embedded education in a body that can give it neither direction, freedom nor support needed to accomplish the task at hand.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Government not only needs to change a number of existing policies and practices but also needs to allow, nay encourage,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>change to happen. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b>It’s<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>time for a public conversation about education on PEI. then we need a plan.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>PEI has 150,000 citizens; all are potential users of educational services. Their need s, interests and capabilities are many and varied, but policy documents are focused on providing services to young people through schools. It’s as though the only education that counts is the part provided by teachers in schools.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Education needs a plan, something simple, some definitions, a few guiding principles, description of services, who will do what and what services will government pay for, access routes, sources of information and help. Such a statement should be short, sharp and developed with public input – but not by outside experts.</b></p>
<p><b>Islanders deserve “better” education service, but better doesn’t appear on the agenda – at least not yet.</b></p>
<p><b>Sincerely</b></p>

<p><b>My definition of education is a simple one; it’s any experience that has a formative effect on the way a person thinks, feels or acts”;<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I also like the idea of education being a process of changing behavior.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Education includes all subjects, all ages, full-time, part-time and self study at home, at school at play and at work. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b>Keeping it within government prevents t from becomeGovernments role is to encourage, support <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>and regulate education. Government success means higher levels o literacy and numeracy, people who<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>are able to care or themselves and live and work together, people who can<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>both cope and thrive, and people who provide services that make our community a place where we want to live and work.</b></p>
<p><b>Education has adopted the <span class="Apple-converted-space">                           </span></b></p>
<p><b>Culture of government</b></p>
<p><b>results in better readers, h It Governments generally have a very narrower definition, one that revolves around subjects and school.; they seem to think that education and “schooling” are one and the same. Such a narrow definition is one of the reason that education is in trouble today and it won’t improve untile we can .<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b>From my perspectiveRducA quick scan of Department titles in Atlantic Canada confirms the confusion -Education and Lifelong Learning in PEI and Education and Early Childhood Development in the other Atlantic Provinces. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>

<p><b>These conclusions arise from an interest, some would say an obsession, with the field, <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>lifetime practitioner in a variety of roles and at a variety of levels, active yet informal information gathering, conversations ad nauseum with friends and colleagues, browsing official education documents and an active<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>review of continuing education, consulting with students to plot a learning path, examination of curriculum development, assessing, grading and reporting student progress and hours doodling on a flipchart.</b></p>
<p><b>While it is true that opportunities for improvement abound throughout the system, autonomy and encouragement seem lacking.</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>mber of issues are systemic and can only be dealt with at the most senior levels. New governments, therefore<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>have a unique opportunity to introduce improvements. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>As a beginning, let me suggest:</b></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li3"><b>A clear and overarching set of beliefs on which the system will operate.</b></li>
  <li class="li3"><b>A function-based organization with a significant measure of autonomy and accountability shifted to front line staff</b></li>
  <li class="li3"><b>A mandate focused on leadership rather than delivery</b></li>

<p><b>These steps are important and direction -setting, and not<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>expensive; they can be easily accomplished through the efforts of current staff and community members.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
