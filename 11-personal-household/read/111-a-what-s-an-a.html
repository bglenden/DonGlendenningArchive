  111 A- What&#x27;s An A
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">A thoughtful essay questioning what an &quot;A&quot; grade actually means and advocating for clear definitions of academic achievement standards. Don compares school grading systems to medical evaluation, arguing that educators should be able to define performance standards just as doctors understand health metrics. He provides examples of &quot;A&quot; performance in various skills and argues for accountability in using grades.</div>

<p><b>WHAT’’S AN “A”?</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>An A is a high mark; the only better one would be AA, AAA, or even AAAA but they are not awarded.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The top students in school, college or university are the A students.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They weren’t born A students; or if they were, they were not labeled as such.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>While parents may think they have a smart, no parent I know would refer to their child an A, B or C child.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is only after children start school that they become known as A students; the school likes labels, I guess.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The school system often applies other labels as well, or instead, such as B, C, D or F,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They may also give students a G.P.A. or even a figure ranging from zero to one hundred<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>A student may earn an A on a single assignment, all assignments, on projects or an exam; that student got an A on the course.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A student who earns an A on all subjects is known as a “straight A” student.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Many students get a mixture of A’s, B’s, C’s, D’s, and even F’s or their equivalent. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Such students are labeled with different letters.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Sometimes schools takes the numbers for each child on each subject at the end of the years to determine general school; the logic of averaging marks on math, social studies, science and phys ed continues to elude me/<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The health system also uses numbers when determining the state of a person’s health.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>During a recent visit, my doctor quoted such figures as 170 pounds, 120 over 70 blood pressure, pulse of 72, a PSA of 4 and so on.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>None of these numbers required judgment; all were based on tests.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>With figures in hand, and without averaging my test results, he proceeded with judgments about my current state of health and I am happy to report that there were no major changes - either improvements or deteriorations. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I am intrigued by the differences between the ways the two systems deals with their information about their clients.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A doctor uses the numbers to determine the state of a person’s health (no averaging of tests from different specialties); a teacher assigns numbers to announce the level of one’s education <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I made some enquiries as to the meaning of an A in education and, in fact asked for written information for y review; none was forthcoming.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Some parents showed me recent transcripts which I found interesting but not very informative.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I tried to search the internet but, not being very skilled, had little success.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Based on my own notes and papers, below are a number of statements which I think describe an A level of performance.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Unfortunately, I do not have sources for them, however, I have descriptions for other levels if any reader is interested.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>An A plumber is a person who, on his own, can generally repair or replace my domestic plumbing while<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>dealing with most unexpected problems during the process.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>An A written Communicator is a person who is able to write creatively using acceptable standards of grammar, sentence structure and organization</p>
<p>A generic description of an A level is a student who has a deep understanding of the process and can complete all important parts.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The student can communicate well, think concretely and abstractly, and analyze and interpret data.</p>
<p>An A<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>team member<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>is a person who is able to consistently assess own behaviour and adjust to maximize group performance, stay on task, contributes useful ideas and defends them when appropriate, uses personal strengths effectively, assumes various roles, accepts a group perspective, participates without prompting.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>“What’s an A?” is a reasonable question and those who use the designation should be able to provide an answer. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
