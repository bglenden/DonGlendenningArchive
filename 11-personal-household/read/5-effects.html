  5 Effects.
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">A detailed personal inventory prepared by Don documenting family heirlooms, awards, personal projects, household furnishings, and memorabilia with their origins and intended disposition. The document reveals Don&#x27;s life story through collections: his Order of Canada medal, craftwork projects from his student years, furnishings from his marriage to Carol in 1969, and treasured items acquired during international travels. This comprehensive list demonstrates his historical consciousness and respect for family heritage.</div>

<p>Art supplies: unsorted as I write; used brushes, opened colours, etc could go to a kids art class; David Trimble of Vernon River gives free lessons in the area and may be interested</p>
