  102-5 Role of Gov
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">The most developed version of the government role discussion, framing education as a service system requiring explicit resource allocation decisions. Don references Education 20/20&#x27;s consultation with youth about needed educational support (information, analysis, feedback, instruction, counseling, coaching). Advocates for healthcare-style service definitions stating what government will fund. Proposes functional rather than school-based organization and questions current delivery assumptions. References OECD (autonomy), Montreal Economic Institute (accountability), UNESCO (access), and UNICEF (relevance) as reform guides.</div>

<b>An
education system is an array of programs and services put in place by
a </b>community<b>
to encourage and support the education of its citizens; support is
usually  focused on  (1) helping individual citizens gain skills,
knowledge, attitudes and values that help them thrive in the years
ahead and (2) providing human resources needed to maintain the
community as a place people want to live.  From my perspective, the
current Department has 150,000 Islanders potentially looking or help.
 </b>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.11in; line-height: 108%"><b>If
we accept the above, we are then faced with the question as to what
help is needed.  Some time ago, Education 20/20 convened a group of
young people and asked them that question; they responded with.  a
long list of ideas, chief among them being assistance with gathering
information, analyzing experiences, obtaining feedback, obtaining
instruction, evaluating selves, coaching others, practicing what is
being learned, observing others, attending lectures, counselling and
observing demonstrations. When asked about the order in which help
was needed, not surprisingly, students followed quite different
paths. Restated, the student list above is similar to typical
education services such as governance, leadership.  funding,
regulation, information, counselling, instruction, quality assurance,
learning products and human resources.   Communities, employers,
postsecondary institutions would likely be equally happy to respond
to questions about their needs as well.</b></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.11in; line-height: 108%"><b>What
kind and how much “educational support” should taxpayers pay for?
 The Canada Health Plan, I am told, has an agreed upon list of health
services it will pay for; perhaps education should consider the same
approach.  It would be an  interesting exercise and one that would
help keep us focused on our prime purpose. IAs an example, 
Government may decide that the arts are important and offer “free”
instruction, materials and supplies On the other hand, our government
may decide to cover the cost of on-line instruction in math.  </b>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.11in; line-height: 108%"><b>The
Department seldom mentions improving quality but, should that be of
interest, the Department may consider some of the suggestions of the
OECD (autonomy for schools), the Montreal Economic Institute
(accountability), UNESCO (access) and UNICEF (relevant curricula) may
be worth considering.    Wht portion of required courses should be
students choice?</b></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.11in; line-height: 108%"><b>Then,
there’s the question of how to organize learning resources; most
organizations I’ve been part of, organize around functions.  Health
services in PEI re delivered in a variety of ways including private
professionals, pharmacies, hospitals, clinics and a great variety of
specialists.  PEI seems to prefer delivery of educational services by
its own employees. Some have suggested a commission rather than
government, grants to families, delivery of some services through
libraries, build schools.  Of course, different approaches may apply
to each service.  Our Department ppears to delivering all education
services trough schools which I liken it to delivering all health
services through the local hospital.  In all my reading, I cannot
recall any articles arguing for government running schools.  Readers
may recall earlier items about service Gaps in Souris, lack of nigh
classes nd short courses, desire formore relevnt courses etc.  Focus
on functions People, insstad of school boards education boards</b></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.11in; line-height: 108%"><b>The
situation calls for action; step one, I suggest, is review and
restatement of our intentions – a public process resulting in a
public document setting out basic beliefs and underlying principles
on which our system should be built.  The initiation of such a
process falls normally to government; it’s preparation, however,
should include substantial public engagement.</b></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.11in; line-height: 108%"><b>As
I write, I am reminded of a quotation in a book, </b><u><b>Setting
Instructional Objectives</b></u><b>
by Robert Mager, popular educator of some sixty years ago.  In making
the case for clear objectives, Mager asks “If you don’t know
where you’re going, how will you know when you get there?” It’s
time, I suggest, it’s time for Education in PEI to review and
restate where “it’s going”</b></p>
