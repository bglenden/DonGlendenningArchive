<div class="reader-summary">Press release announcing results of Souris training needs study conducted by Education 20/20 with funding from SkillsPEI and the Canada-PEI Labour Market Agreement. The study examined training needs and employment barriers in this declining coastal community. Key findings: employers face shrinking labor pools and skill gaps, especially for specialized equipment; training institutions run at capacity; 40% of respondents had explored training in past three years; 59% prefer online instruction. Pressing needs identified include healthcare, small business, computer studies, and trades training. Study was conducted by MRSB (Maritime Regional School Board). The release emphasizes timeliness given PEI&#x27;s growth and strong economy, requiring a flexible, skilled workforce. Demonstrates Don&#x27;s ability to frame local community research in provincial economic context.</div>

Souris residents had an opportunity
Wednesday evening to hear first hand the results of a study about
training needs and opportunities in their community.  Like many other
small communities, Souris faces challenges of a declining population
and a seasonal workforce.   Employers are faced with a shrinking
labour pool and available people frequently lack needed skills,
especially skills needed to deal with specialized equipment.

Training institutions in the area
are running at or near capacity and do not have the resources to
increase offerings; Holland College will be offering upgrading
classes including courses on line. Forty percent of respondents
reported exploring training opportunities in the past three years.
When asked about training need to improve their own employment
situation, respondents mentioned a wide range of practical courses in
the heath, small business, computer studies and trades such as
carpentry.  When asked their preferred delivery method, 59 percent
were interested in receiving instruction on line, 40% through night
school and 38% via correspondence or self study.</p>

Strategies for closing the gap
include courses on line, more information about training options and
availability, hands on practical training, how to operate specialized
equipment, extending the school day at Souris High,</p>

The study included a review of
current offerings and capacity, interests and needs for further
training as viewed by residents, employers and the community at
large.  The study was conducted for Education 20/20 by MRSB and was
funded by the Department of Workforce and Advanced Learning through
the Canada-PEI labour Market Agreements. The study comes at a
crucial time in that PEI is in the midst of population growth and a
strong economy; future employment will require a flexible and skilled
workforce. The final report is available on the Education 2020
website..</p>
