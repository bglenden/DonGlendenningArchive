  2009-16 Annual Events
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Dated May 29, 2009, Don reviews CFPEI&#x27;s annual signature events: July 4th receptions for US citizens, summer lecture series, and fundraising dinners at the Roma Historic Site. He provides detailed historical context and evaluates effectiveness, noting positive feedback and donor conversion from early events. Don credits sponsors and the Culinary Institute for enabling low financial drain on CFPEI. He suggests evaluating all events against mission alignment and proposes four alternatives: continuing US reception with fees, combining summer lecture with fundraising, partnering with the Culinary Institute for donor receptions, or merging US reception and summer events into an &quot;Abegweit Society&quot; with membership.</div>

<p>SD-2009-16</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Date:</b>		May 29, 2009</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Subject:</b>	Annual Events</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Prepared by</b>:	 Don Glendenning</p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>History;	</b>CFPEI currently holds the following events each year:</p>
<p>:</p>
<p><b>July 4 Reception for US citizens</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The purpose of the US reception is twofold: to recognize the contributions of US citizens and to promote CFPEI as a cause but also as a mechanism to contribute to causes of interest.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We have now organized four receptions, two at the Havilland Club and two at the Culinary institute of Canada.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>All receptions included entertainment and a cash bar; the first reception provided light food, the second and third provided a buffet meal and the fourth provided finger food only.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The third reception was overwhelmed by saw a large number of tourists, as opposed to summer Islanders,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>From my perspective the first and fourth reception came closest to meeting the CFPEI objectives in that its organization was less labour intensive and more time was available for conversation.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In all cases, the financial drain on CFPEI was minimal thanks to sponsors and the generosity of the culinary Institute of Canada.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Feedback from guests has been positive and at least two guests have become supporters of CFPEI</p>
<p>.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><b>Summer lecture series</b><b></b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>For three consecutive summers, CFPEI has organized a series of four lectures each summer; the first two were hosted by the Victoria Playhouse and the last one by Bites <br>
Café.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Years I and two also included a summer social.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The quality of the lectures was excellent but the turnout was relatively small; as a result a social event was not held in year 3.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Organizing the series was quite labour intensive but costs were minimal.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Roma Fund Raising Dinner</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>During the past two years, CFPEI has organized a fund raising dinner held at the Eoma Historic Site at Brudenell.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Both events were successful an, although a fair amount of work was involved the event is felt generally to be of good quality and reflects well on CFPEI.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A summer Islanders’ fund has been established as a result of this activity.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I believe that the future of these activities should be discussed with a view to deciding whether they meet our objectives, are consistent with the CFPEI mandate and if they should be continued as separate activities, terminated or modified.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Suggestions that have arisen in informal conversation with people include the following:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Continue the Us Reception but set a fee</p>
<p>Convene one summer lecture and let it serve as a fund<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>raiser</p>
<p>Partner with the Culinary Institute for a major dinner or reception for donors and friends</p>
<p>Combine the US Reception and the summer islanders into a single club, the Abegweit Society, with a membership fee to cover organizing costs</p>
