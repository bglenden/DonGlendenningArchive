  2-1 Key skills-Math 
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Research notes on a practical mathematics survey conducted by Holland College in 1978, with revival attempt documented here. Original study invited 10 islanders to identify key success skills; six surveys returned with five completed. Results showed skill identification ranging from 41-128 skills with average of 78.2. Identified challenges included unclear instructions, spelling errors, and confusion from repeated questions with varied wording. Mathematical functions least understood included trigonometric applications and vector calculations. Notes indicate intention to revise instructions and conduct expanded second survey, demonstrating Don&#x27;s commitment to understanding fundamental educational competencies.</div>

  <li class="li4">Using <span>Practical Mathematics</span>, an analysis undertaken by Holland College in 1978, we invited 10 people to check off skills that “islanders believe are key to success; six surveys were returned; five had been marked and one was left blank.</li>
  <li class="li4">Comments included: a couple were unclear; enjoyed it, it brought back many memories, made me think of my children’s math; used it to consider skills needed by a new hire; there were some mis-spelling; Some instructions were repealed with slightly different wording which may have caused some confusion</li>
  <li class="li4">Apply trigonometric functions and “calculate using vectors” least understood</li>
  <li class="li4">Of the five completed, number of skills ranged from 41-128 with an average of 78.2</li>
</ul>
<p>I intend to revise the instructions and do a second survey.</p>
