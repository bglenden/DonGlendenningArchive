<div class="reader-summary">Proposal document for developing comprehensive mathematics competency mapping in PEI. Observes that every PEI educational institution teaches mathematics but most base curriculum on outcomes-based or competency-based approaches, despite appearing unique in their analysis. Claims differences in educational achievement rest primarily on two factors: range of competencies demonstrated and level of achievement per competency. Proposes establishing comprehensive competency list spanning grades and age groups, where students select or are assigned competencies with differences only in achievement levels. Documents conversations with UPEI, Holland College, Department of Education, employers, and community members showing interest in exploration. Notes similar systems practiced in Ontario and other jurisdictions through &quot;qualification authorities.&quot; Argues PEI would benefit from master competency list and matching rating scale. Proposes Education 20/20 lead development role benefiting from improved quality, reduced costs, better communication, and provincial leadership positioning.</div>

<span style="display: inline-block; border: none; padding: 0in">To
some degree, every educational institution and training organization
in PEI teaches math.; most base curriculum on a form of outcomes
(Outcomes Based Education   Curriculum Based Outcomes and Competency
Based Education).  All agencies seem to undertake the analysis
process as though what they are doing is unique to them.  I’ve
looked at a number of outcomes and find that the differences are
mostly one of level of specificity.</span></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.24in; background: #ffffff">
<span style="display: inline-block; border: none; padding: 0in">Furthermore,
my exploration reveals that the differences in educational
achievement rests primarily on two factors, (1) the range of
competencies a person can demonstrate and  (2) the level that each
person can demonstrate on each competency. Based on this view, it
should be possible to establish a comprehensive list of competencies
that span all grade levels and age groups.  Students either select or
are assigned the competency to be learned; the difference between any
two learners in any competency is only the level of achievement that
can be demonstrated.  A teacher’s role is to help learners select
the competencies needed and to raise the learner’s level of
achievement on each.</span></p>

<span style="display: inline-block; border: none; padding: 0in">I
have had a number of conversations about math with representatives of
UPEI, Holland College, Department of Education, employers and
community members and, while not saying that there is support for
this specific proposal, there is interest in some quarters for
further exploration.  Based on the above, we believe that PEI should
develop, and would benefit from, a master list of competencies and a
rating scale to match.  The idea is not new, seems to be widely
practices in Ontario and elsewhere.  Some countries try to accomplish
through the same feature the establishment of “qualification
authorities”,</span></p>

reducing costs, including communication, easing transition, securing
an even better range of study resources and cast us in a leadership
