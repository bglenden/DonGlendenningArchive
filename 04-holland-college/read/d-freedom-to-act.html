  D Freedom to act
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">A substantial letter arguing that bureaucratic constraints represent the primary barrier to education improvement. Don advocates for increased autonomy at school and teacher levels, greater flexibility in scheduling and staffing, and local decision-making authority. He references his Holland College experience as evidence that organizational freedom enables quality improvement. He calls for an Education Council with broad community representation and revised Schools&#x27; Act to delegate greater autonomy. This piece synthesizes his core conviction that systemic improvement requires structural freedom combined with accountability.</div>

Sir:</p>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">The
freedom to act, or alternatively an oppressive bureaucracy, is
perhaps the distinguishing feature of most education systems in
Canada today, and is a major barrier to educational improvement.  The
emphasis on time, content, conformity and batch processes are out of
sync with the twenty first century.  Most people I talk with, both
inside and outside the education system, know this and are frustrated
by it, but cannot seem to find the key to unlock it.  Increasingly,
people are in the mood for change, but where should one start?</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Let’s
deal quickly with responsibility; who is responsible for education? 
The simple answer is “We are”.  We can blame the government, the
PEITF, school Board, individual teachers or whoever, but when we are
finished we still have the problem.  So let’s start with ourselves.
 We all need become better informed, ask more questions, enter the
debate, and reward desired changes.  The kind of change people want
is most likely when dozens of people speak to the Premier, the
Minister, their MJA, their school board member, their school
principal.  Share your views with everyone who will listen.  One
friend mentioned convening a family gathering for the purpose of
discussing education, and that family included a number of people who
work in the profession.  Engagement</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">The
report of the Education Governance Commission contains useful
information about the state of education on PEI, however, based on
their findings I would propose a different set of recommendations;
here are three:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
	That the Minister establish an Education Council  reflecting a cross
	section of Island composed of users of the system, students,
	parents, employers, and others.</p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
	That the Schools’ Act be revised to delegate greater autonomy and
	accountability to schools.  Principals need to be given more freedom
	in choosing the tools they need including the ability to adjust the
	budget, funds for professional development, staffing patterns, etc. 
	</p></li>
</ul>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">During
the past year or more, I’ve had conversations on the subject of
education with parents, employers, educators, retirees and more in
kitchens and coffee shops across the Island.  Some people sought me
out, some were people I had just met who wanted to talk about
education before we got down to business, and others were initiated
by me.  Some complaints arose from the experience of a child or
grandchild; some are concerned about an unchanging system in a
changing world,

what I’ve heard, I ask myself not what changes are required but why
the changes are not occurring,

improve education, none would hold a candle to giving teachers
freedom to act and accountability for their actions.

teachers.It is unlikely that the quality of education will be either
better or worse as a result of the decision to move to a single board
of Trustees.  What could have an impact, however, is the nature of
decisions a Board is able to make on its own.  
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Given
my interest in improving the quality of education, when the dust of
reorganization settles, I’ll be interested in only one thing, and
that is the degree of freedom  to make decisions that is delegated to
the Board of Trustees, the Principal and individual teachers.</p>
