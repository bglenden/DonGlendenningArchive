  2009-1C Constitution
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">This draft constitution for Glenway Estates Association Inc. was written by Don Glendenning to establish governance structure for a cottage development purchased in 1970 by the MacCuaig, Glendenning, and Galloway families. Don proposes amendments to clarify membership, director authority, and decision-making processes, advocating for greater consultative governance. The document demonstrates Don&#x27;s continued civic engagement in community organizations and attention to proper governance principles even in retirement.</div>

<p><b>Draft 1</b><b></b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>GLENWAY ESTATES ASSOCIATION INC.</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>BACKGROUND</b><span class="Apple-converted-space">     </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The land for the summer cottage development known as Glenway was purchased in 1970 by the MacCuaig, Glendenning and Galloway families with the first lot being sold and cottages erected by 1971.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>During the first 25 years, road maintenance was provided by the original owners with contributions from lot owners.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>By 2006, waterfront lots were individually owned and, in 2008, the centre section was subdivided into separate and individually owned lots.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>By 2006, lot owners entered into discussions about establishing a Glenway owners association.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The organization was brought into being through a process of discussion/participation by all residents (at least all were invited), over a period of weeks if not months.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Those involved in the “birthing” process, and that included most residents, expressed an interest in retaining the consultative model in dealing with Association business.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A committee was struck, a constitution and by laws were approved and the Glenway Estates Association, Inc. became a legal entity.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>In 2008, the Association was presented with a request that, although simple, was contentious.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As a result, much of the discussion was not about the issue itself but rather about how the issue was handled and who could vote. As a result, and on reflection, the writer is of the view that our current constitution and bylaws interfere with the consultative process rather than fosters it; furthermore, the writer believes a broader consultative process should be restored and reinforced.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>To do this, changes in, or interpretations of, the constitution and by laws will be required.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>ISSUES</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The following issues appear to be in play:</p>
<p><span><b></b></span><br></p>
<p><b>Membership</b></p>
<p><span><b></b></span><br></p>
<p>Bylaws says the following about membership in the association:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span>Article 401</span><span> 	“membership in the Association shall consist of all lot owners and subsequent lot owners”.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span></span><i>Does this mean that, if a lot is in the name of two or more people, husband and wife for example, both are members?</i><i></i></p>
<p><span>Article 4.05</span>	“members shall have the power to establish, levy, assess and collect the assessments of charges”</p>
<p><span>Article 10:06</span>	“Members shall be entitled to one vote for each lot …”</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>20 lots = 20 members = 20 votes; an owner of multiple lots could have multiple votes to match the number of lots owned;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span></span><br></p>
<p><span></span><br></p>
<p><span></span><br></p>
<p><b>Directors</b></p>
<p><span><b></b></span><br></p>
<p><span><b>Article 6.01</b></span>	“the affairs of the Association shall be managed by a Board of a minimum of three (3).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>All Directors of the Association shall be members in good standing of the Association or the immediate family and, in either event, over the age if 18 Years.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><span><b>Article 6.03</b></span>	“…the board shall be <span>elected</span> annually, …”</p>
<p><span><b></b></span><br></p>
<p><i>We could appoint Janet as a Director</i></p>
<p><i>Elected or appointed?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>See article above and below</i></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Article 6.05	“Each lot in the Glenway Subdivision shall be entitled to <span>appoint</span> one representative to the Board of Directors for each individual lot as set out in the Survey Plan but no subdivided lot shall be entitled shall be entitled to have more than one representative on the Board.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In the event that a member or members own more than one lot, then that member or members may have more than one representative on the Board provided that the representative is a member of the Association.” <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><i>How does one become a member without being a lot owner?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Does that mean that Janet could be a Director but not a voting Director? <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Need an example</i><i></i></p>
<p><span><b><i></i></b></span><br></p>
<p><i>20 lots: A owns five, B owns two, C owns three, remainder own one each for total of ten</i></p>
<p><i>What is the maximum number of votes possible at a meeting?</i></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Conceptually, in a membership-based non-profit organization a Board of Directors is a smaller unit of governance than the full membership. As such it can act on behalf of the full membership, but only in a temporary way as its actions must be ratified or negated by the full membership. Typically, the Board consists of the Officers of the Association and a relatively small number of at-large members.</p>
<p><span><b></b></span><br></p>
<p><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>However, in the construction of our Board of Directors, we left the door open to anyone who was a member to self-select as Board members. To reflect the limited authority of the Board, it was determined that board membership would be tied to lot ownership, but with no one board member having more than one vote. As it stands any lot owner can declare to being a member of the Board of Directors; if 2 or more persons share ownership in one lot, their Board membership is 1/2 each. If the 2 own more than one lot, both owners can be Board members, if they so declare.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Can’t seem to find authority for this position</p>
<p><span><b></b></span><br></p>
<p><span><b></b></span><br></p>
<p><span><b></b></span><br></p>
<p><b>Officers</b></p>
<p><span><b></b></span><br></p>
<p><span><b>Article 9.01</b></span>	“The officers of the association shall be a President, Vice-president, Secretary, and Treasurer.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>All officers shall be members of the association or immediate family of a member of the Association.”</p>
<p><i></i><br></p>
<p><i>Janet could be an officer</i></p>
<p><span><b></b></span><br></p>
<p><span><b>Article 9.02</b></span>	All officers shall be chosen by a three-fifth vote of the Directors</p>
<p><i></i><br></p>
<p><i>Shouldn’t officers be elected by membership?</i></p>
<p><span></span><br></p>
<p><b>Dues</b></p>
<p><span><b></b></span><br></p>
<p>The Association has agreed that assessments will be on a per lot basis</p>
<p><span></span><br></p>
<p><b>Decision Making</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The current constitution assigns decision-making as follows:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Members </b>– set and collect fees, elect the Board,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Officers – </b>President, vice-president, Secretary and Treasurer; duties identified in bylaws; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Directors – </b>manage the affairs of the association; elect officers; call meetings, exercise (7.02)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“all powers, duties and authority vested in or delegated to the Association, except those reserved to the members.”; maintain complete records; supervise all officers, agents and employees; choose officers; fill vacancies among directors until the next annual meeting;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Annual meeting – confirm minutes; approve banking accounts and financial statements; deal with resolutions; confirm nominations of Directors; confirm capital expenditures; consider other business;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Article 10.05 all capital expenditures shall be approved by the membership</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span></span><br></p>
<p><b>PROPOSED CHANGES</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The writer proposes that the Bylaws be amended to:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Give full authority to the membership to carry out the purposes and objects of the association:</p>
<p>Delegate such authority to the Directors as it deems appropriate</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Amend 7:01 (ii) to read:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>To exercise for the Association all powers, duties and authority specifically delegated by the members including that of:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>presenting a slate of directors/Officers to the annual meeting,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>presenting an agenda for the annual meeting ,</p>
<p>implementing any decisions taken at meetings of the Association,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>overseeing any committees created by the membership ( such as road maintenance, beach access maintenance, etc).</p>
<p>Approving a budget including annual fees</p>
<p>Recommending a plan of work for the new year</p>
<p>Exercising such duties, responsibilities as my be delegated to it by the membership of the Association<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Amend Article 10.03 as follows:</p>
<p>No change</p>
<p>No change</p>
<p>No change</p>
<p>Elect Directors/officers</p>
<p>Approve capital expenditures</p>
<p>Receive an annual report on action taken<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Other business</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>CONCLUSION</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>With boundaries such as these, any deliberations for the well-being of the Association would take place during the annual meeting of the Association as well as the business of the Association such as the assessments needed.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span><b></b></span><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>I think that this past summer's experience proved the rather unwieldy nature of this arrangement. I'm not clear how giving a board member more than one vote clarifies the situation and distinguishes the Board from the Membership.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></p>
<p>your suggestion would help alleviate some of the confusion that we experienced last summer in regards to the role of the directors and membership.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Proposed</b></p>
<p><b>Amend Article 10.12</b></p>
