<div class="reader-summary">Correspondence from Don to Roger Hogan regarding DACUM&#x27;s 50th birthday celebration and a potential book project about Bob Adams and the DACUM process. Don discusses Holland College&#x27;s early adoption of competency-based education and invites Hogan to visit PEI to meet original practitioners. He offers to arrange a public presentation on outcome-based and competency-based education, notes the college&#x27;s current status regarding DACUM implementation, and expresses his understanding that while competencies remain in use, formal DACUM analysis has been discontinued. The letter reflects Don&#x27;s continued connection to educational reform networks and institutional memory.</div>

<p>Dear Lance:</p>
<p>Thanks for your follow up letter; I have been reminiscing with some colleagues and put pen to paper, so expect to keep my promise to send some notes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In the meantime, I’ll mail a copy of a book on Holland College published in 2008.</p>
<p>A number of interests appear to be converging; let me share some thoughts:</p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li1">DACUM will soon be celebrating a 50<sup>th</sup> birthday.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We are planning to purchase a copy of your book, <span>DACUM: The Seminal Book</span>, to present to Holland College in Bob’s memory.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li1">Given your planned book about Adams and the DACUM process, have you considered visiting Prince Edward Island to meet some of the “originals”? Students?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Staff?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Faculty Perhaps even a Board member or two?.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I know that they would happy to meet you and could provide some very useful insights into the application of DACUM in our early years.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li1">Should you actually visit PEI, and if you are willing, we would be delighted to arrange for you to make a public presentation on the current status of OBE/CBE; a presentation on DACUM alone would likely not draw in such a small community.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There is an issue of your travel costs; I’m wondering if you have access to travel grants?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Should you be interested we could talk further. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
</ul>
<p>As for Holland College, you should be aware that I retired from Holland College in 1987 and the intervening years have seen a number of Presidents and Acting Presidents come and go; I am not sure just how many of the current staff served during my term. Current College views on CBE and DACUM would best provided by current President, however, it is my understanding that while competencies are in use ,the DACUM analysis is no longer practiced. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>I am long out of touch with what’s happening across the country with regards to CBE; the Canadian Vocational Association offers DACUM facilitator training on a regular basis; employment sector councils are based on competency analyses but I do not know the extent to which CBE is practiced in colleges or industry.</p>
<p>I’m embarrassed not to have been back in touch with Coleen for some time but I expect to visit Halifax in early May and plan to touch base at that time.</p>
<p>Regards.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
<p><br></p>
