  D 2014 Education moving outside school
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Published July 12, 2014, Don discusses the TOWES Test (Test of Workplace Essential Skills) developed at Bow Valley College, which assesses nine competencies including reading, numeracy, communication, and computer skills—areas employers frequently cite as deficient in graduates. He notes usage at Holland College and possibly other programs but absence from public schools. The test provides proficiency levels rather than rankings, addressing employer needs for meaningful competency verification. The letter reflects his pragmatic approach to bridging school-to-work transitions and finding market solutions to credential gaps.</div>

<p>Dear Sir:</p>
<p><b>Education moving outside school<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Employers need employees who can read and write but having a high school graduation diploma doesn’t provide that information; a copy of transcripts probably won’t tell either.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But there is a new tool on the market that may help; it’s called a TOWES Test; it’s worth having a look.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>TOWES (Test of Workplace Essential Skills)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>was developed at Bow Valley College in Alberta and tests a person’s level on nine essential skills, reading text, document use, numeracy, writing, oral communication, working with others, continuous learning, thinking skills and computer skills.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>These are the weaknesses most often mentioned by employers.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>One thing I liked about it is that, unlike traditional school exams, it gives levels rather than simply ranking students.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I know that it is used at Holland College and I believe with some other adult training programs; it may also be used in the public schools but I have not aware of it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If it lives up to its reputation, it may supply employers with information they need, and even replace the requirement for graduation diplomas.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Check it out and send me you views at<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>HYPERLINK "mailto:standards2020@gmail.com" <span>standards2020@gmail.com</span>.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
