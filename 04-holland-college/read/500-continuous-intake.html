  500 Continuous Intake
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Don criticizes traditional education&#x27;s time-based administrative system where learners must begin and end on fixed schedules regardless of learning progress. He argues schools should operate more like hospitals, keeping students under care until they reach acceptable performance levels. At Holland College, Don experimented with continuous or staggered entry and exit, allowing students to begin programs when spaces became available rather than on rigid semesters. He acknowledges implementation challenges, particularly with small one- or two-instructor programs, but maintains the concept&#x27;s validity. The essay reflects tension between administrative convenience and pedagogical effectiveness.</div>

<p><b>Continuous Intake</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>Elsewhere in these my musings, I referred to the fact that education is driven by an out-dated administrative system where time on task is the constant and performance the variable.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The system focuses on groups not individuals and forces learners to begin and end studies, not based on learning progress but at the sound of a bell.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Teachers are required to fashion their teaching to fit available time rather than the system accommodating the needs of students. Learning theory collides with administrative practice and administration usually wins. The rigidity of the system, in my view, is a major deterrent to change.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The reverse should be the case.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Doctors keep you under care or in the hospital until you are better; teachers should keep you in their care until you perform at an acceptable level.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Elsewhere I identified a number of beliefs or principles followed in designing the Holland College approach to learning and teaching.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>One was the students should be able to enter or exit a program on their own time – that is, make time, not achievement, the variable.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Exiting on completion was not a problem,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>except that it made graduation exercises difficult to organize; staggered or continuous intake, however, was different.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Entry and exit times to programs, courses and units are prescribed by the “system’ as are the number of days or hours of instruction available to each learner for each subject studied, and grades are awarded based upon how much was learned in the time available.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Even colleges and universities, institutions with considerable control of their operation, operate on a time based system <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In addition to being at odds with real life, it paces instruction at a rate well below the rate of learning of many students; neither allows nor gives incentives to move through the system more quickly and results in some students listlessly waiting for the teacher and other members of the class to catch up.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Even after spending a life in the field, the logic of this approach learning still escapes me. Compare this with hospital treatment where the administrative system is designed to support the treatment of individual patients – if more days are needed to regain health, a hospital stay may be extended.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>This delivery model is at odds with practices in the work world where one finishes one job before moving to the next.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Many years ago during a visit to Newfoundland, I learned that on graduation day in the vocational system in that Province, roughly the third week of June, some 600- graduates of the secretarial program would enter the labour market and compete for jobs.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Not only should intake be staggered, I thought, but also a staggered exit also has advantages.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Theoretically, a new student should be able to enroll in a program as soon as a seat becomes available.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is a well known fact that no two students are at the same place in their studies at the same time in their life and, furthermore, students learn at different rates.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Even if, theoretically, two students were at exactly the same stating point, within days there would be major differences in their achievement levels on subjects being taught. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Individual entry and exit can and does work but this approach may require schools to operate on a different administrative model and requires teaching skills different from those used mostly in the traditional model.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Some instructors, I know, have great difficulty in applying an individualized approach.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In my experience, teachers with supervisory experience before entering teaching had fewer difficulties in adapting to a continuous intake model than teachers without such supervisory experience.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Although Holland College experimented with multiple and continuous intake, our record was spotty to say the least.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>One of our major problems was the many one and two-instructor programs.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>On reflection, however, I still believe in the concept and would give it more attention in the future.</p>
