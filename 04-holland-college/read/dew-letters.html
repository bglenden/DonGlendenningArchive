  DEW Letters
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">A detailed explanation of Holland College&#x27;s &quot;DEW Letters&quot; (Distant Early Warning letters), which alerted students early if they were at risk of not meeting learning objectives—inspired by the Cold War-era DEW radar line. Don explains the rationale: students needed immediate feedback, not just at mid-term, as part of the teaching-learning process. This innovative early intervention system exemplifies Holland College&#x27;s student-centered approach under Don&#x27;s leadership and his integration of Canadian cultural references into educational practice.</div>

<p><b>DEW Letters</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Old timers will remember the DEW line – a series of radar stations positioned across northern Canada to provide a “Distant Early Warning” of incoming enemy aircraft and missiles.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They were very much a product of my time and are well known in PEI because of the pioneering aviation work of Carl Burke, the founder of Maritime Central Airlines, in delivering men, equipment and goods to Canada’s north.</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>We, at the College, were of the view that students in danger of not reaching their learning objectives should be alerted to that fact as early as possible; waiting for the results of mid-terms was often too late.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We also believed on the need for immediate feed back,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>whether favourable or unfavourable, as part of the teaching-learning process. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>With the adoption of the STEP model, instructors were expected to be in almost daily discussion with each student about their learning objectives and progress but this was sometimes only honoured in the breach.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Unfortunately, some instructors followed old patterns or took too literally that students were responsible for their own learning and the instructor was waiting for the student to call for help.</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>In addition to incorporating the analysis into the daily teaching learning routine, we decided that, on a regular basis, student progress charts would be collected by the Registrar and analyzed to determine that students both individually and collectively were making progress.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was a simple yet onerous task because it involved examining each student chart preparing both a student and class progress graph - and sometimes the instructor felt uncomfortable having to pass the student charts to the Registrar for analysis and the Registrar felt uncomfortable doing it.</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Following the analysis, learners whose progress was not at what was expected, were the subject of conversation between the Registrar and the instructor following which, a decision was taken to issue or not issue a DEW letter.</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>DEW letters themselves were very short; they were as the name implies, simply an early alert to the student about his or her progress.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They also ensured that student and teacher talked about the student’s progress and that termination, if necessary, came as no surprise.</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>In retrospect, it may have been a silly name but the concept was sound and the review process for each student at the earliest possible date is a crucial one.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Certainly and on reflection, this is one aspect of College operation that I would strengthen and automate if ever involved in an educational operation again.</b></p>
