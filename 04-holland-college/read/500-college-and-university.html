  500 College and University
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Don recounts the founding context of Holland College during PEI&#x27;s &quot;Unholy War&quot; university merger controversy in the late 1960s. He explains his conviction that PEI needed a technical college distinct from university education, one providing training for occupations both within and beyond the island. This essay defines the philosophical differences between colleges and universities: colleges emphasize applied knowledge, intensive specialty study, field-derived content, employment success metrics, integrated theory and practice, and industry partnerships. Don argues against subordinating college curriculum to university transfer requirements, maintaining that quality college programs should prioritize relevance to employment and community needs rather than university credit transfer.</div>

<p><b>College and University</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>I was still living in Ottawa during “The Unholy War that rocked Prince Edward Island’ in the late 1960’s.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Reaction to the merger of the two universities was noisy; as for a technical college, I am told that educators saw no pressing need.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As I understand it, it was felt that the addition of a few courses at the Provincial Vocational Institute, or even the addition of diploma courses at the local university, would be more than adequate.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Given the latter view, expectations for the new institution were not great.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Forty years later, I am happy to report that the view has dramatically changed.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Growing up on the east coast of New Brunswick, I was painfully aware of the exodus of young people for Toronto and points west.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Most making the journey found work but<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>for many that work was low paid and heavy; too<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>few accessed well paid jobs or opportunities in the then emerging economy.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The focus of jobs for graduates of the new College became an issue.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>To what extent should the College limit itself to providing training for occupations not found in PEI or where opportunities on PEI were limited?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Debate on the issue was neither long nor vigorous – but it did take place.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was taken for granted by the new Governors, that Holland College would provide training for Islanders wherever their employment prospects would take them.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Modern industry requires highly skilled people.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Without matching skills, people will not find work, and without a pool of skilled workers, industry will steer clear of PEI as a placed to do business.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Changes in industry would soon find their way to PEI; PEI needed to get ready.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Understandably, in a small and rural Province like PEI, people wondered if two postsecondary institutions less than one mile apart were required, especially when both offered courses with similar names and similar content.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Why not, people might ask, simply add a few new courses, the major so called?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Others wondered if PEI should not follow the Quebec model and make the new college a first level for all students entering post secondary education.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>While some colleagues may disagree, there is certainly no doubt in my mind that PEI chose the better course.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Any other option would not have provided programs of the same quality and integrity.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>In comparison to Universities, Colleges:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Emphasize the application of knowledge rather than its acquisition</p>
<p>Provide more hours of study in a specialty that their counterparts in universities even though the<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>length of the program is shorter</p>
<p>Draw content from the field rather than disciplines</p>
<p>Judge success by the record of employment of its graduates</p>
<p>Offer an integrated program of theory and practice leading to a career rather than a series of courses</p>
<p>Maintain relevance through close linkages with the appropriate industries</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>While I support seamless transfer from College to university, university transfer was not a Holland College objective at the time.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Nevertheless, students transferring to university programs could expect credit for work completed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I felt strongly that quality college programs should not be tampered with for the sole purpose of obtaining advanced university standing.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Consequently, Holland College viewed itself as an institution serving the interests and needs of all Islanders; the only exception was that group of Islanders whose first interest was in obtaining a university degree; the College would help each student but did not design programs with university in mind.</p>
