<p><b>Initial Statement</b></p>
<p><b>on Request for Access to Glenway Drive</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Opening</b></p>
<p>Important question, one of the most important we will have</p>
<p>I am quite prepared to deal with it but lack adequate information</p>
<p>I also have concerns about the process and the optics but these remarks only deal with technicalities of the access issue.</p>
<p>Why are we being dragged into a family squabble; McInnis have the resources to resolve the issue within their own resources?</p>
<p><b>Issues</b></p>
<p>Access by Linda</p>
<p>Verbal agreement with McInnis</p>
<p>Who are dealing with? Gerald? Linda? Pius/ McInnis family?</p>
<p>The manner in which the issue will be resolved</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Insufficient or unclear information:</b><b></b></p>
<p>What did Gerald ask for?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I’d like to see a copy</p>
<p>Why McInnis family can’t or won’t provide access to a family member? (Are we getting involved in a family dispute?)</p>
<p>Why is granting access good for the Association<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>MOU contains hearsay about an alleged permission</p>
<p>Why present a draft agreement that you yourself say may not be enforceable?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>What consideration have you given to the needs/interests of Glenway members - dust problem at Lot No. 1, erosion at corner near lot No.1, awkward and perhaps dangerous corner near Lot No. 1</p>
<p>Options are incomplete – do the clauses in option A apply to options B and C?</p>
<p>Factual error in Option C – it does not take more land out of production</p>
<p>How large a lot does Gerald intend to give?</p>
<p>Location of access – regulations and safety concerns</p>
<p>Size of access opening</p>
<p>Location of lot</p>
<p>Are there any regulatory requirements to be met?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Costs to Glenway, if any, for changes to road, surveying? Legal documents?</p>
<p>Liability for a non-member of Glenway<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>to whom we give legal right to use</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Closing comment</b><b></b></p>
<p>With the above information, I will be glad to deal with the issue</p>
<p>Too important an issue to be dealt with along with road repairs, financial statements and a request for a grant.</p>
<p>Move that the Executive be asked to gather more detailed information and convene a special members meeting to deal with the<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>access issue and this issue only.</p>
