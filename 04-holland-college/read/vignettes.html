<div class="reader-summary">(329 words):** File 18 contains multiple philosophical essays addressing core educational issues. Schooling-education distinction emphasizes that schools contribute to but don&#x27;t monopolize education; homes, communities, peers educate as well. Current conflation discourages lifelong learning and non-school learning recognition. Vocational education definition derives from learner purpose, not content: same course becomes vocational or academic based on employment intent. Cultural divide essay identifies school-work disconnects—task-switching regardless of completion, teacher-dependence, absent service mentality, outdated industrial structures, minimal student responsibility. Don proposes cultural, not curricular, solutions: individual focus, output emphasis, achievement measurement, teacher accountability, learning plans, skills emphasis, community standards. Holland College founding reflections defend the separate college approach, emphasizing quality over university-transfer convenience. His teaching principle—&quot;If the learner hasn&#x27;t learned, the teacher hasn&#x27;t taught&quot;—recognizes learning as individual responsibility while placing accountability on teachers. Continuous intake advocacy proposes flexible enrollment matching hospital practice: instructional time becomes variable while achievement standards remain constant. These vignettes synthesize Don&#x27;s educational philosophy addressing systemic contradictions between stated goals and operational practices. He emphasizes individual learning, measurable achievement, practical relevance, teacher accountability, and system flexibility. This collection represents his mature reflection on educational fundamentals—why schools exist, what they should accomplish, and how they should operate.</div>

<p><b>Going to School or Getting an Education<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Educators confuse schooling and education - and their confusion impacts on the public as well.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We do not similarly confuse health and hospitalization, religion with church attendance or citizenship with court appearances.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Why, therefore, do we continue to speak of education when we mean schooling?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I know that we have an education system and a Department of Education but I assume that bear those names because they not only operate schools but the also operate libraries, GED testing, music competitions, <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Otherwise, it would be more accurate to name it the Department of Public Instruction.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Is the confusion just sloppy thinking or is it part of a deliberate plan to blur the lines? <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I am not knocking the value of schools; they are major contributors to one’s education.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But so are the home, church, peers, travel, the community and others.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The popular view is that we get our education in schools and from elsewhere we get only experience.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But isn’t the essence of education learning from experience wherever that experience occurs?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>One’s education is certainly lacking without the knowledge and understanding of history, language, science, mathematics and the arts.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Add to that the need for highly homed communication skills.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>These are certainly contributors to one’s education but they are not one’s education.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Good’s Dictionary of Education defines schooling as “individual training or education received in an educational institution, military or civilian.”</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Education, on the other hand, is defined as “the aggregate of all processes by means of which a person develops abilities, attitudes and other forms of behaviour of positive value in the society in which he lives.” <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Schooling is that part of one’s education resulting from ones experiences while in school.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Schooling is often described by the number of years of study, the institutions at which we studied or from which we graduated, the results of our examinations and the diplomas and degrees we hold. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The school system draws its content from a narrow range of disciplines.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Typical school subjects include English, French, science, art, physics, chemistry, biology and mathematics. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Education, on the other hand, draws its content from real life and addresses the issue of what a person knows and what one can do with what one knows.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A measure of one’s education is the level and extent to which one can apply what one has learned – in fact, in my view, that is the highest level.</p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>Blurring the differences between schooling and education likely to:</p>
<p>Discourage life long learning,</p>
<p>Create dependence rather than promote self reliance,</p>
<p>Limit learning to what is available in school or offered by teachers,</p>
<p>Limit the range of studies to traditional disciplines,</p>
<p>Deemphasize the importance of personal skills such as self-reliance, problem solving, entrepreneurship and creativity.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I was asked recently to complete a form providing information about myself; it included a section on education.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I answered by saying that my works habits were learned at home as was my value system, my communication skills were learned at school and elsewhere, technical skills I had learned at NBIT and my judgment resulted from a wide variety of educational experiences.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I now from the way the inquirer looked at me that all he wanted to know was where I went to school and for how long.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>And does it really make any difference where one<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>learns?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is the fact that you have learned rather than where you learned that counts.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In fact, it is likely that we should give more credit to people who have learned outside the formal school system.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>A system is in place to provide schooling, and I think it is a good one.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But let’s call it what it is, a school system not an education system. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>What makes Education Vocational?</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>For most of my life, I have been a vocational educator, and proud of it. The truth is, however, that most of my early training and experience were in academic and general education, and my major was in secondary education.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In fact, I am one of a very small number of New Brunswick teachers holding both an academic and vocational teacher’s license.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The term vocational has long lost its luster in North America, although, I am told, is perfectly acceptable in elsewhere in the world.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In my view, much of the formal study of a doctor, lawyer or clergyman is as vocational as that of a carpenter, accountant or nurse.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>So, on what basis do we decide whether education is general or vocational?</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Course or program name?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Most would agree that welding, carpentry electrical, mechanics and machinist are vocational programs. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Some would add cooking, photography and secretarial.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The ministry is often referred to as a vocation.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And I would certainly add medicine, accounting and law and other professions.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Each is an integrated program of studies leading to a recognized qualification intended to prepare takers to be producers.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Entrance Requirements? <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Should we measure the “vocational ness” of programs according to previous years of schooling required for entrance?</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Length of Program?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>One could consider the length of the training program as<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>a major factor in determining if a program is vocational.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I’ve been part of discussions during which vocational programs were defined as programs of one year or less duration, technicians were products of programs of 2 to three ears and all others were considered degrees.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But I can think of a number of programs where that rule no longer applies.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Designation awarded?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Maybe we can distinguish by the piece of paper awarded by the institution at the completion of<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>the program.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The problem is that many institutions offer a variety of programs of varying lengths and institutions offer too many pieces of paper for this to be a determinant.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Institution offering the program? <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Fifty years ago Canada had separate vocational schools, institutes of technology, colleges and universities.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Today, however, community colleges have become multi-purpose institutions offering courses in a wide range of fields and at many levels.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Furthermore, one can find courses of essentially the same content and level in any and all of those institutions as well as provided by the private sector.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Focus? <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A number of years ago, I discovered a statement prepared by the Oregon Education on life roles that we all fill, learner, citizen, family member, consumer, producer and individual.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Preparation for these roles underlies all schooling; preparation for the producer role is the essence of vocational education.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Exit Standards? <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Performance standards also separate general and vocational education.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Vocational students are held to a higher standard, that is, the standard applied in the occupation for which the person is preparing.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Definition<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Vocational education is that part of one’s education designed to provide and improve the level of<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>skills required as a producer of goods and services.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The learner’s purpose says it all.</p>

<p><b>Cultural Divide</b></p>
<p><i></i><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Each child born into the world can look forward to playing a variety of roles during his or her lifetime; these role, according to one source, includes that of individual, learner, producer,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>consumer, family member, and citizen. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>People go to school to get help in preparing for or improving their performance in those roles.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The ultimate test of schools is how well people perform in real life.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Individual needs for help will vary from individual to individual,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>and in some cases schools may not be able to help some students, but surely that is the school’s objective.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Schooling has been organized into a number of generally recognizable levels. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Probably elementary, secondary and post secondary are the most usual but other, and finer, classifications can also be made.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Classification is based on either the age of learners or their years of study. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>It is generally accepted that each level of schooling has a responsibility to prepare those in its care for the next stage of life, either the next level of schooling or adult life roles.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>During the first 12 years, further education appears to get the most attention; other life roles, especially that of the producer, are practically ignored.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And this bias is reflected in both courses and culture.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Learning work-related skills while in the public school, it seems, is an unplanned bonus and not part of a school’s offering for most students.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>There is a significant disconnect between the operation of schools and the operation of most other segments of adult life.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>An article in the March 1997 issue of the Phi Delta Kappan, for example, refers to schools “reinforcing anti-work attitudes.” <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Typical examples of such reinforcement include:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Students moving from one task to another after a set time whether or not the task is complete.</p>
<p>Students being dependent on teachers with work ending when the teacher leaves the room.</p>
<p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Schools are lacking a service mentality; for example, they welcome reasons to close rather than find ways to stay open.</p>
<p>Schools maintain an historic industrial organization structure even when that structure has changed dramatically in the work place.</p>
<p>Students are not encouraged to take responsibility for, or to invest in, their own education.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If they miss a day, so what?</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>To this list one might add that the school system:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Obscures accountability of teachers</p>
<p>Fails to recognize and reward high performance of teachers</p>
<p>Bases pay on past education and time served rather than performance</p>
<p>Emphasizes time rather than performance for both teachers and students</p>
<p>Has a very limited view of what constitutes education<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>In addition, an article in the New York Times of March 4, 2004 documents employer experience with student interns.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Most, but certainly not all, of the problem areas relate to work habits – work habits that are acceptable in school but certainly not in the work world.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>By poor work habits, I mean the ability to work as a team member, attitude towards fellow workers and to customers and the inability or unwillingness to assume responsibility, etc. In short, the school environment should more closely reflect the expectations of the community that supports it, including the employment community.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>After all, that is where students will spend most of their lives.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The issues identified above are cultural issues; they cannot be resolved simply through adding new courses. We need to change the delivery model.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Closing the gap will require changes in the way schools operate, a focus on each individual and his/her learning, output rather than input, achievement rather than time spent, increased accountability of each teacher, learning plans not lesson plans, skills not just subjects, better reporting of student progress and community based standards.</p>

<p><b>College and University</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>I was still living in Ottawa during “The Unholy War that rocked Prince Edward Island’ in the late 1960’s.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Reaction to the merger of the two universities was noisy; as for a technical college, I am told that educators saw no pressing need.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As I understand it, it was felt that the addition of a few courses at the Provincial Vocational Institute, or even the addition of diploma courses at the local university, would be more than adequate.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Given the latter view, expectations for the new institution were not great.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Forty years later, I am happy to report that the view has dramatically changed.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Growing up on the east coast of New Brunswick, I was painfully aware of the exodus of young people for Toronto and points west.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Most making the journey found work but<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>for many that work was low paid and heavy; too<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>few accessed well paid jobs or opportunities in the then emerging economy.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The focus of jobs for graduates of the new College became an issue.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>To what extent should the College limit itself to providing training for occupations not found in PEI or where opportunities on PEI were limited?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Debate on the issue was neither long nor vigorous – but it did take place.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was taken for granted by the new Governors, that Holland College would provide training for Islanders wherever their employment prospects would take them.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Modern industry requires highly skilled people.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Without matching skills, people will not find work, and without a pool of skilled workers, industry will steer clear of PEI as a placed to do business.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Changes in industry would soon find their way to PEI; PEI needed to get ready.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Understandably, in a small and rural Province like PEI, people wondered if two postsecondary institutions less than one mile apart were required, especially when both offered courses with similar names and similar content.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Why not, people might ask, simply add a few new courses, the major so called?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Others wondered if PEI should not follow the Quebec model and make the new college a first level for all students entering post secondary education.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>While some colleagues may disagree, there is certainly no doubt in my mind that PEI chose the better course.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Any other option would not have provided programs of the same quality and integrity.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>In comparison to Universities, Colleges:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Emphasize the application of knowledge rather than its acquisition</p>
<p>Provide more hours of study in a specialty that their counterparts in universities even though the<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>length of the program is shorter</p>
<p>Draw content from the field rather than disciplines</p>
<p>Judge success by the record of employment of its graduates</p>
<p>Offer an integrated program of theory and practice leading to a career rather than a series of courses</p>
<p>Maintain relevance through close linkages with the appropriate industries</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>While I support seamless transfer from College to university, university transfer was not a Holland College objective at the time.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Nevertheless, students transferring to university programs could expect credit for work completed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I felt strongly that quality college programs should not be tampered with for the sole purpose of obtaining advanced university standing.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Consequently, Holland College viewed itself as an institution serving the interests and needs of all Islanders; the only exception was that group of Islanders whose first interest was in obtaining a university degree; the College would help each student but did not design programs with university in mind.</p>

<p><b>If the Learner Hasn’t Learned</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>Unfortunately, at least for my students, I taught for several years before I began to understand the teaching-learning process.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I say this, not in the sense of blaming my professors but rather because of the likely negative impact on my early students caused by my deficiencies.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Perhaps it was because I was a graduate from a small high school, because my initial teacher training was only of six months duration, because I was still not 18 years at the time or even because I was in a none-room school – or most likely because of some combination of the above.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>In any case, my understanding of teaching and learning only jelled yeas after my teaching career was well under way.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Thanks to additional formal study, learning on the job, and a variety of both learning and life experiences, I began to gain a better and deeper insight into the teaching-learning interaction.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>At one point in my career, I was fortunate to play a role in the teaching of teachers both on a full-time and part-time basis it was an experience that I thoroughly enjoyed and will always treasure.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The following statement always brought animated discussion:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><i>If the learner hasn’t learned,</i></p>
<p><i>The teacher hasn’t taught.</i></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I believed the statement then and still believe it now, a fact that tended to sharpen debate.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The role of a teacher is to help others learn; if the learner in question hasn’t learned what he/she was being taught, then it is obvious that the teacher hasn’t taught.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But, my students would counter, surely some of the learners in my class would learn.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My point, however, is that groups do not learn.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Granted individuals may learn in a group-setting but learning is an individual matter.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When you refer to learning, you are referring to specific individuals.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The reason for a learner not learning may reside outside a learner; the learner may not be ready, not be motivated or even have a learning impediment.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Whatever the reason, if a student has not learned a teacher cannot claim to have taught.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Continuous Intake</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>Elsewhere in these my musings, I referred to the fact that education is driven by an out-dated administrative system where time on task is the constant and performance the variable.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The system focuses on groups not individuals and forces learners to begin and end studies, not based on learning progress but at the sound of a bell.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Teachers are required to fashion their teaching to fit available time rather than the system accommodating the needs of students. Learning theory collides with administrative practice and administration usually wins. The rigidity of the system, in my view, is a major deterrent to change.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The reverse should be the case.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Doctors keep you under care or in the hospital until you are better; teachers should keep you in their care until you perform at an acceptable level.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Elsewhere I identified a number of beliefs or principles followed in designing the Holland College approach to learning and teaching.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>One was the students should be able to enter or exit a program on their own time – that is, make time, not achievement, the variable.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Exiting on completion was not a problem,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>except that it made graduation exercises difficult to organize; staggered or continuous intake, however, was different.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Entry and exit times to programs, courses and units are prescribed by the “system’ as are the number of days or hours of instruction available to each learner for each subject studied, and grades are awarded based upon how much was learned in the time available.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Even colleges and universities, institutions with considerable control of their operation, operate on a time based system <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In addition to being at odds with real life, it paces instruction at a rate well below the rate of learning of many students; neither allows nor gives incentives to move through the system more quickly and results in some students listlessly waiting for the teacher and other members of the class to catch up.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Even after spending a life in the field, the logic of this approach learning still escapes me. Compare this with hospital treatment where the administrative system is designed to support the treatment of individual patients – if more days are needed to regain health, a hospital stay may be extended.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>This delivery model is at odds with practices in the work world where one finishes one job before moving to the next.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Many years ago during a visit to Newfoundland, I learned that on graduation day in the vocational system in that Province, roughly the third week of June, some 600- graduates of the secretarial program would enter the labour market and compete for jobs.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Not only should intake be staggered, I thought, but also a staggered exit also has advantages.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Theoretically, a new student should be able to enroll in a program as soon as a seat becomes available.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is a well known fact that no two students are at the same place in their studies at the same time in their life and, furthermore, students learn at different rates.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Even if, theoretically, two students were at exactly the same stating point, within days there would be major differences in their achievement levels on subjects being taught. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Individual entry and exit can and does work but this approach may require schools to operate on a different administrative model and requires teaching skills different from those used mostly in the traditional model.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Some instructors, I know, have great difficulty in applying an individualized approach.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In my experience, teachers with supervisory experience before entering teaching had fewer difficulties in adapting to a continuous intake model than teachers without such supervisory experience.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Although Holland College experimented with multiple and continuous intake, our record was spotty to say the least.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>One of our major problems was the many one and two-instructor programs.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>On reflection, however, I still believe in the concept and would give it more attention in the future.</p>

<p><b>Beyond Knowledge</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>In hindsight, I had been seeking a competency based approach to education for many years. Perhaps the stage was set by the learning model found in a text book by S. R. Laycock, a professor of Education at the University of Saskatchewan; his description of the learning process impressed me and stayed with me.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Later as my interests and studies moved beyond grades and subjects to education, the need for a more meaningful way to organize instruction became even more evident</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>In hindsight, stages or steps in my journey include:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Designing training programs, at least vocational ones, took me beyond textbooks and disciplines, and into the community and work place.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Text books come later, if at all.</p>
<p>Experience in vocational education where the first task of the teacher therefore is to find out what practitioners do, and then to prepare students to do likewise.</p>
<p>Detailed curriculum planning required to ensure that the training being offered addresses skills, knowledge and attitudes required for a chosen career.</p>
<p>My involvement in teacher education especially in the teaching of methods and curriculum development.</p>
<p>My exposure to discussions about nationwide standards so that skilled workers can meet qualifications required in any jurisdiction.</p>
<p>An introduction to programmed instruction or programmed learning in the 1960’s.</p>
<p>DACUM, the results of an occupational analysis presented on a single page<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>and used by learners and teachers alike as well as a basis for recording progress.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Then came the <span>Taxonomy of Learning</span><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>by Benjamin<span> </span>Bloom in which he not only identified three domains of learning, cognitive, affective and psychomotor, but also levels of learning for each domain.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>In the cognitive domain, the most often cited, Bloom identified six levels of learning with the lowest level being knowledge and the highest level being evaluation.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Students climb the ladder of learning starting with knowledge and work their way up through comprehension, application, analysis and synthesis to the highest level of learning, that of evaluation; there is no skipping of levels. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Unfortunately it seems, public schools are stuck on the first level, that of comprehension.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Perhaps it is a matter of reporting, or lack thereof.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I say that because my review of the literature has failed to uncover a community based description of levels.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>To wit, how do you define/describe an “A” in terms of performance.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>What performance can we expect for a student with an A that we should not expect from a student with a B?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I am sure that is taken into account in awarding grades but it is neither well stated nor understood.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>While some would argue that vocational programs are narrower in focus, there is no question in my mind, what is taught in a quality vocational program is taught at a higher level.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The description of levels of performance is one of the criteria that differentiates vocational programs from others in that each level is described in terms similar to those used for an employee in the workplace.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In fact, in my view, the distinguishing characteristic of vocational programs is the description of rating levels and has little if anything to do with content.</p>

<p><b>Teachers as Change Agents</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>Teachers are change agents.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They help learners gain a set of behaviours needed to participate in adult community.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Content is the easy part.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>To learn is to change; to teach is to help others change.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In educational jargon, changes may be in the cognitive, affective or psychomotor domains.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>More simply put, a person who has learned has new or changed attitudes, skills or information or some combination thereof. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Learning is an individual matter.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Only the learner can learn.<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>The stimulus for learning may be internal or external and the actual learning may take place in a group setting or when the individual is alone.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A teacher does not teach a class but a teacher may teach individuals at the same time in a group setting. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The role of a teacher is to stimulate learning – to create a set of circumstances so that a learner learns the desired behaviour. To help a learner to learn is to help bring about changes in the learner.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Teachers need a variety of techniques in their tool kit – and they will likely require all of them.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Tools include setting an example, providing information, asking questions, setting time lines, assigning projects or home work, organizing field trips and assessing performance.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The trick for each teacher is to create a learning environment for each learner that will result in each learner having a favorable experience, even in a group setting.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Not easy but it is the crux of good teaching.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Teachers use subjects as a medium for teaching; most any subject serves as a medium through which to teach communication skills; perhaps the school environment is the best medium for teaching citizenship.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Most subjects can be used as a medium for teaching a number of skills.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Teachers use a variety of methods to both motivate and teach students assigned to their care such as having students take tests and exams, prepares course papers, participates in discussions and group activities, field trips.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>One cannot measure English, Literature or chemistry one can, however, measure one ability to communicate in a language, ones ability to solve problems, discuss great authors, summarize events, ability to analyze a situation and draw conclusions, etc.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This is what people do in real life.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>

<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>WHAT’’S AN A?</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>An “A” is a high mark; the only better one would be A+, AA, AAA, or even AAAA. The top students in school, college or university are the “A” students.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>People weren’t born “A” students; or if they were, they were not labeled as such.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>While parents may think they have a smart child, no parent I know would refer to their child an A, B or C child.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is only after children start school that they become so classified; schools like labels, I guess.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The school system often applies other labels as well, or instead of, letters; they may also give students a GPA. Number or even a figure ranging from zero to one hundred.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>A student may earn an A on a single assignment, all assignments, on projects or an exam or even a subject studied for a whole year.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A student who earns an A on all subjects is known as a “straight A” student.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Many students get a mixture of A’s, B’s, C’s, D’s, and even F’s.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Schools often average student's marks for a year although the logic of averaging marks on such diverse subjects as math, social studies, science and physical education continues to elude me. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The health system also uses numbers when determining the state of a person’s health.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>During a recent visit, my doctor quoted such figures as 170 pounds, 120 over 70 blood pressure, pulse of 72 and figures for PSA, cholesterol, etc.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>None of these numbers required judgment; all were based on tests.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>With figures in hand, and without averaging my test results, my doctor proceeded with judgments about my current state of health; I am happy to report that there were no major changes - either improvements or deteriorations.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I am intrigued by the differences in the ways the two systems deals with their information about the individuals they serve.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A doctor uses the numbers to determine the state of a person’s health (no averaging of tests from different specialties); a teacher assigns numbers to announce the level of one’s knowledge of a field.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I made some enquiries of schools as to the meaning of an A in education and, in fact asked for written information; none was forthcoming.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Some parents showed me recent transcripts which I found interesting but not very informative.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I tried to search the internet but, not being very skilled, had little success in finding what constitutes an A.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I have trouble interpreting the meaning of an A.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Oh, I know that it represents a judgment call by a teacher as to how well a student knows a subject<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>- but it doesn’t tell me much about what a student can do with what he knows.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Take Language Arts, for example, does having an A mean that the person writes clearly and logically, has a greater vocabulary than most other students, speaks well and with logic?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If so, why not say so? If not, what does an A mean?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It requires a definition.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Information like this would be especially useful to employers.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>In my notes and papers, I found a number of statements which I believe describe an A level of performance.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Unfortunately, I do not know their sources.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>An “A” level:</p>
<p>Plumber is a person who is able, on his own, to generally repairs or replaces my domestic plumbing while dealing with most unexpected problems during the process.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Writer is a person who is able to write creatively using acceptable standards of grammar, sentence structure and organization.</p>
<p>Chemical technician is a person who has a deep understanding of the process and can complete all important parts.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Speaker is a person who is able to communicate well, think concretely and abstractly, and analyze and interpret data.</p>
<p>Team member<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>is a person who is able to consistently assess own behaviour and adjust to maximize group performance, stay on task, contributes useful ideas and defends them when appropriate, uses personal strengths effectively, assumes various roles, accepts a group perspective, participates without prompting.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>“What’s an A?” is a reasonable question.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Those being labeled deserve to know what it means.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The rest of us need help with interpreting it in every day life.</p>

<p><b>Inverting the Pyramid</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>During the summer of 1948, I found work as a carpenter with a company building houses at the Chatham Air Base.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I appeared at the gate about 7:30 one morning looking for work; by 8:00 o’clock I was assigned to a crew framing a new house.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A couple of days later, I was cutting rafters and shortly thereafter the foreman assigned me to fitting trim around windows and doors.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Forty years later at Holland College, we designed programs with that employment practice in mind, that is, we introduced students to their field of study in the same manner that a new employee was introduced to the real work situation. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Ours was a spiral curriculum with learners moving from simple to complex skills just as one would in the work situation.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Even as students moved through their program, they recycled back through earlier skills as their interests and performance both required and allowed.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>We also used this approach also to bring into the instructional mix both required and desirable skills and knowledge from science, mathematics and communication.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Instruction and content were coordinated with skills being learned in the field of interest.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>This approach tended to build on the interests that brought a learner to the College in the first place.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>An added advantage was the fact that, should a student decide at any point to discontinue training, he or she could do so with having already gained some basic employability skills.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The inverted<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>pyramid:</p>
<p>Capitalizes on the student’s interest</p>
<p>Allows students to enroll in some of their interest courses and would probably reduce the first year drop out rate.</p>
<p>Provides students who drop out early with some employment skills</p>
<p>Reflects real life experience...</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The reverse is to “load the first year with foundation courses - mathematics, physics, chemistry and communications.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The theory behind this approach, apparently, is that having learned the “general rules”, the student is in a better position to understand the specifics.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This emphasizes the view that learning proceeds from the general to the specific; based on my experience, that is not the case.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Is one better than the other?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That depends.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>For older workers, the inverted pyramid reflects their actual career path.<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>They entered the workforce with no or a limited amount of post secondary education, they picked up courses that were available as interest and time allowed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Frequently such courses were work related.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Later in life, they took additional courses to broaden their education, to fill in some gaps or to obtain a diploma or degree. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>A Four-letter Word</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>While I may not have an extensive vocabulary, I try to be reasonably careful about the words I use.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Sometimes I slip although, even then, I’m not prone to using words which slur a listener’s race, gender, religion or politics.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I’m also sensitive to the use of four letter words which, although common, may be offensive.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>On the other hand, I am very comfortable with some four-letter words which other educators seldom use.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The one which comes most quickly to mind is “work” - as in preparation for work.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is such a descriptive word; I am puzzled as to why we do not use it more frequently when speaking about the role of schools.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Where I grew up, work was a perfectly acceptable topic of conversation.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As was the idea that going to school helped prepare one for work.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was understood at my home that those who completed high school, and for sure those who went beyond high school, were likely to have work which was easier and paid better than those who did not.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The fact that some relative or friend “got a good job” was a mark of respect and carried to a certain degree of satisfaction - especially if it applied to a family member.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>My recollection, also, is that a student’s “going to work”- finding a job- was perfectly acceptable topic of a conversation among teachers or at least, between teachers and students. As teachers, we knew that all of our students would go to work at some point in their lives and that was one of the major reasons why they had come to school.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Fellow students, when I was one, talked about work, looked forward to going to work, expected to go to work.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That was one of the main reasons for going to school.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This also applied to studies in college and university.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The idea of schools helping people prepare for work seems to have faded from sight.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Schools now are bent on preparing students only for further education.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In my view, preparing for further education and preparing for work are not the same thing; the difference is in the standards applied rather than the content taught. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Over the past few years I have had opportunity to review considerable literature from schools and from Departments of education.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My reading suggests that, in the minds of the education officials, the connection between school and preparation for work is tenuous to say the least.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Schools provide career exploration, job shadowing, transition, career awareness experiences; these are weasel words.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They are not words that carry significance and accountability.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>So how you may ask, if schools adopted an objective of helping young people prepare for work, what would they do that is different from what they do now? <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Probably not a whole lot but among other things they would likely:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Require a demonstrated acceptable level of skill in school subjects<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If students do not reach the published standard, a graduation diploma should not be awarded.</p>
<p>Include problem solving, team work and work habits and show ratings in the same way they now show ratings on history or chemistry.</p>
<p>Require an acceptable skill level in numeracy and information technology skills.</p>
<p>Require a level of knowledge and understanding of working life equivalent to their knowledge of requirements for further study.</p>
<p>Organize schools in a way that reflects work life rather than academic life.</p>
<p>Staff schools with people having a wide range of skills not just high levels of formal studies.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Would operate on a model that reflects real life not just formal education</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I once asked a school trustee why his school did not offer more of an orientation to later employment.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>His answer was both clear and direct.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“When the Minister tells us to, we’ll do it.” <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>So, until the Minister decrees otherwise, schools will continue to limit their thinking to further education rather than the ultimate goal of being a productive citizen.</p>

<p><b>Relevant Standards</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>A gap exists between what the public expects of schools and what schools deliver; the two do not speak the same language.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Two recent reports, a US report on <span>Common Core State Standards</span> and the Ontario <span>Provincial Report Card</span> address the gap but both, in my view, are still works in progress.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If working models exist, they have not come into my view - at least not yet.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In my view, exit standards is the pressing issue of the day.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>By standards, I refer to the level of growth attributed to being in school.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Standard:	A standard is a level of performance expected of a service or product</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>A standard has three components:</p>
<p>Criteria are the factors against which we measure.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Criteria for evaluating writing, for example, may include:</p>
<p>Vocabulary</p>
<p>Style</p>
<p>Use of reference	</p>
<p>Sentence structure</p>
<p>Creativity</p>
<p>Grammar,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>2	A rating scale describes levels of performance; the scale for writing shows six levels:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>6	Creatively written whiled observing acceptable standards of grammar, sentence structure and organization.</p>
<p>5 	Very well organized showing precise and wide vocabulary, good sentence structure and appropriate grammar and some creativity.</p>
<p>4 	Organized with few errors in grammar and sentence structure,</p>
<p>3 	Organized with acceptable grammar and sentence structure.</p>
<p>2 	Generally organized but shows limited vocabulary and significant errors in grammar and sentence structure.</p>
<p>1 	Disorganized and unfocused with many errors in grammar and sentence structure accompanied by a limited vocabulary.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>3	A benchmark is a level of performance which is widely recognized by practitioners and which serves as the reference point. A benchmark anchors a standard in reality.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A benchmark for reading could be as simple as the ability to read and discuss articles in the daily paper. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>An average, competent or skilled plumber is “a person who comes to your house and can usually fix the plumbing problem without having to call or return to the shop. “<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Although we may be able to remove judgment from the testing process, we cannot remove judgment from the standards process.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>To use an example from the health field, a doctor subjects a patient to a variety of tests, then makes a judgment as to the next course of action.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The answer lies, not in the removal of judgment but in its consistency. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p><b>School is not a Competition<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>Whether I stand first or last in my school class is my business and only my business.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I go to school for help with my learning, and I resent my grades being posted for all to see.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If I want someone to know what my grades are, I will tell them.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I have no evidence that posting my grades helps my education.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>On the other hand, if I enter a competition, I expect to be ranked, and have my rank made public.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But enrolling in an educational institution is not a race, not a competition – or it shouldn’t be.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Institutions that rank students and publicize the results are doing their students a disservice.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>While schools may teach competition, it should not be run on a competitive basis.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Reaching an A level of performance in any subject is within reach of most students if given a few more hours of instruction.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If an A is important, why not give students time to reach it?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>How long it takes to learn a skill and how quickly one can perform it are quite separate issues. Grades, at least theoretically, point to how much and how well a student learned in a given period of time; grades do not tell how much a student can do or how well in a given time – and it is the latter that counts outside of school.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Unfortunately, schools place limits on the achievement of many students by making time the constant and achievement the variable.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Instead of designing a system that allows all students to reach the top level, Schools impose time limits that force some students to quit before they reach the level of which they are capable.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Our current arrangement is to allow only one student to reach the top of the mountain each year and is the student, not the school that gets penalized.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Now I am not against student competitions and the recognition of high standing gained therein or for awarding prizes and publicity to winners.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In fact, I think that there should be more competitions and rewards for educational accomplishments.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My view, however, is that such competitions should be outside not inside the school system.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Schools are in the education business not the sorting business; they should not be in the sorting business.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The publication of all grade information is sorting but publication of rank is sorting in its most odious form.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Colleges and universities are and should be free to set the criteria for entrance and to institute their own selection procedures.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Taking this position, I would argue, would allow schools to concentrate on providing a good education and not limit the educational experience to those subjects required for university or college entrance.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Obtaining an education should not be limited to the few courses now required for high school graduation.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>According to what I read, many secondary schools in the USA no longer rank high school students and some who do, refuse to release their rankings to universities and colleges.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I am told that upwards of 50 percent of all high schools have taken this stand.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>My own experience with ranking is limited and ancient.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The one example that comes to mind, however, is a grade eight or nine graduation during which the rank of every student was given.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The event made a lasting impression.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I’ve often wondered about the impact of that event on the students’ future.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Its time to discontinue the practice of ranking students and spend the time gained in increasing their levels of performance.</p>
