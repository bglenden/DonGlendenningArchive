</div>

<div class="reader-summary">This comprehensive document explores Don&#x27;s core educational philosophy through the lens of outcomes. He begins with foundational concepts of teaching and learning, distinguishing between schooling and education based on Good&#x27;s Dictionary definitions. Don identifies six life roles as essential starting points for educational planning and criticizes the gap between parent/taxpayer expectations and professional educator priorities. He argues that clear, unambiguous, measurable outcomes are essential for effective educational planning and that outcomes should prepare graduates for life and work, not just further academic study. Don provides detailed characteristics of educational outcomes (drawn from community, observable/measurable, clear/unambiguous, performance-based assessment) and contrasts them with curriculum-based outcomes. He includes recommendations for outcome development, reporting structures, and cites John Burke&#x27;s work on competency-based education.</div>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">While
disposing of memorabilia recently, I came across, and actually
reread, a number of papers on education.  Most of the critical
articles express concerns
that the education system cannot adequately prepare students for life
and work in the 21st Century.
I am concerned about that issue also.  The rereading, together with a
scan of the internet and my own experience in the education field,
confirmed my view that there is a major difference between
parents/taxpayers and professional educators about the role of
schools.  I call it expectations but outcomes, perhaps, may an even
be a better descriptor.  As background, let me say a few words about
teaching and learning.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">.
In several states, educators and policy makers are attempting to
change the way we measure the effectiveness of education from an
emphasis on traditional inputs, such as course credits earned and
hours spent in class, to results or outcomes. 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><b>Teaching
and Learning</b></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Learning
is a process of change.  When a learner learns, he/she acquires more
or different information, skills or attitudes, or, in the words of
educators, change may occur in the cognitive, affective or
psychomotor domains.  Simply put, a person who has learned has new or
different attitudes, skills or information or some combination
thereof. Learning is very much an individual matter; only the learner
can learn.  To help a learner to learn is to help bring about changes
in the learner.  The stimulus for learning may be internal or
external and the actual learning may take place in a group setting or
when the individual is alone.  A teacher does not teach a class; a
teacher teaches a number of individuals at the same time in a group
setting.  
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">The
role of a teacher is to stimulate learning – to create a set of
circumstances so that a learner changes behaviour.  Teachers help
change lives; they do it in a variety of ways including providing
information, asking questions, setting time lines, assigning projects
or home work, organizing field trips, being a role model, engaging
learners in discussions, having learners undertake group projects and
assessing performance.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Learning
is not limited to what happens in school, although this paper is
primarily focused on school based learning.  People often confuse
education and schooling; that thinking is prevalent both inside and
outside the system.  We do not similarly confuse health and
hospitalization, religion with church attendance or citizenship with
court appearances.  I am not sure, therefore, why we continue to
speak of education when we mean schooling.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Good’s
Dictionary of Education defines schooling as “individual training
or education received in an educational institution, military or
civilian.”  Education, on the other hand, is defined as “the
aggregate of all processes by means of which a person develops
abilities, attitudes and other forms of behaviour of positive value
in the society in which he lives.”  In my words, schooling is that
part of one’s education resulting from one’s experiences while in
school.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">If
teachers are helping learners to change behaviour, it behooves them
to have a clear idea as to what the desired behaviour really is.  For
clarity, I use expectations, graduation requirements and outcomes to
differentiate between long term and short term descriptions of what
is to be learned.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><b>Life
roles</b></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">I
have had many discussions about this subject with people of all ages
and of many walks of life, including people in the business
community.  It was not a formal survey and this is the first time I
have put pen to paper in an attempt to clarify my own views and to
share them with others. 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">My
thinking is very clear.  In the long view of education, the role of
schools is to help people to develop the skills, attitudes and
knowledge required to be good citizens.  Good citizens fill many
roles in their lifetime and the emphasis varies throughout their
lives.  This is most succinctly captured in the <u>Oregon
Education Act for the 21</u><sup><u>st</u></sup><u>
Century</u> which
identifies the following life role of Oregonians:</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<ul>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
	Individual</p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
	Learner</p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
	Producer</p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
	Citizen</p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
	Consumer</p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
	Family Member</p></li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">This
is as clear a statement as I have encountered and certainly reflects
my view as to the starting place for educational planning.  Having
said that, however, I am aware that readers may hold other views.  
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">The
discussion about schools must start here.  I believe that this is
where differing expectations begins to occur.  Unless this is clear
and agreed to, we cannot develop the school system we need or want. 
These are long term goals and, as such, change little over the long
term.  Since the focus of this paper, however, is the end of
secondary school, I refer to the next set of descriptions as
graduation requirements.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><b>Educational
Outcomes</b>.  
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Although
the identification of outcomes is only a small step in the planning
process, it is the foundation of future planning; improper,
inadequate, imprecise objectives results in a weak if not faulty
system.  Improvement in education will only come when outcomes are
clear, unambiguous and relevant.  The ones now used as a basis for
educational planning do not meet those criteria.    Having worked in
an outcomes-based system, however, I believe that I have a reasonably
good understanding of outcomes as a basis for developing school
programs</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">I
was delighted with the arrival of Outcomes Based Education (OBE); I
thought that it was simply a more “academically respectable” name
for competency based education but the more I learned the more uneasy
I became.  On closer examination, I found significant differences. 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">In
summary, competency based education:</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<ul>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
	Is organized around needs of
	individuals rather than groups of learners</p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
	Is more specific in the way
	outcomes/competencies are described</p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
	Uses  words familiar to the
	users rather than an academic language</p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
	Draws its statements from the
	community/occupation/life rather than from disciplines or  textbooks</p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
	Identifies actions and not
	knowledge 
	</p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
	Emphasizes performance not
	grades or time required to learn</p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
	Bases assessment on observed
	performance rather than tests, assignments and exams</p></li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Examples
of competencies and outcomes are shown in the following table:</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p align="center" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%; margin-right: -0.5in">
Outcomes are expectations. 
They identify what is expected at a given stage along a journey.  In
this paper, the journey is mostly about the schooling component of
one’s education; even with this, there are many stages but this
paper focuses on the stage generally referred to as high school
graduation.  Desired outcomes determine what is to be taught, how it
is to be taught, how results are to be measured.  
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">I
have now used the expectations and outcomes interchangeably; now I
add competencies.  Although I know that purists define them
differently, for the purpose of this paper I treat them as one and
the same.  From my review of the literature, it appears that the term
“outcomes” is widely accepted in education and “competencies”
in the field of training.  Outcomes are thought to be a bit broader
and more appropriate for education; on the other hand, if one is a
student of Bloom’s Taxonomy of Education, one might say that
competencies represent a higher level of learning than doe outcomes. 
Some jurisdictions use learning outcomes to describe exit outcomes.
is another way From a practical point of view, however, and for the
purpose of this paper, I consider the terms interchangeable.  
</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
The concept of outcomes is
simple.  To quote from an article on <u>Outcome-based
education</u> at
www.answers.com 
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
“Start by developing a clear
picture of what learners should ultimately be able to do successfully
at the end of a significant educational experience (i.e., the
outcome). Then base (i.e., develop) the curriculum, instruction,
assessment, and reporting (i.e., education) directly on that clear
picture. This is a simple matter of clearly defining what one wants
learners to be able to do (the end) before the beginning, teaching
them how to accomplish that end, and then assessing and documenting
the end they were to achieve in the first place.”</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
Let me be very clear at this
point, in speaking of outcomes I am only referring to a series of
statements describing performances that a high school graduate must
be able to demonstrate before receiving a high school diploma.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
Confusion abounds.  Outcomes
and Outcomes Based Education (OBE) are not the same; neither are
competencies and Competency Based Education (CBE).  School systems
may use outcomes and competencies in a variety of ways some times
referred to as traditional, transitional and transformational – but
that is a separate issue.  OBE, CBE and many innovations go beyond
the identification of outcomes and describe a preferred way, at least
by the promoter of the model.  To add to the confusion, is the
concept of mastery learning, the spiral curriculum and standards
based education.  Outcomes are foundational to a meaningful education
whatever the teaching/learning model in which they are used</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%; margin-right: -0.5in">
It may be useful to say a few
words about Curriculum Based Outcomes (CBO) that are so widely used
in education and, although important to the teacher, are at odds with
the expectations of the customer.  To draw a parallel for a moment,
curriculum outcomes may be similar the describing the outcomes of a
medical procedure.  They are important but do not respond to the
patient’s question “Will I be able to walk again?</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Educational
outcomes constitute a clear set of expectations for each student at
any identified level.  Educational outcomes:</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

<ul>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
	Are drawn from the community
	in which the student will live or operate and reflect adult
	performance; they are not drawn from disciplines and textbooks. 
	Based on the view that the role of the school is to prepare students
	for life, outcomes will be drawn from the community in which the
	person will live not from academic disciplines.  Disciplines are
	taught in support of life-based outcomes.</p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
	Identify observable and
	measurable actions that are ascribable to each individual not just
	to a class. Objectives begin with such words as direct, discuss,
	explain, construct, present, organize, etc. Understand and know are
	not acceptable when stating an objective; instead one must search
	for the word or words that describe the demonstration proving that
	understanding or knowing has taken place. 
	</p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
	Are written in such a way as
	to convey a single, clear and unambiguous action.  The curriculum
	outcome in the box above, for example, includes writing, speaking,
	listening and reading and includes both technology and mathematics
