<div class="reader-summary">Letter to U.S. Office of Education presenting the same educational separation thesis as the McGuinty letter. Don introduces himself as founding President of Holland College and references connections to Professor Robert Norton at Ohio University who promotes Holland College&#x27;s practices internationally. He proposes establishing qualification authorities independent of schools to separate teaching from assessment functions. Demonstrates his international advocacy for competency-based education models and willingness to engage policy makers across borders.</div>

<p>U.S. Office of Education</p>

<p>USA</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Dear Secretary:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>By way of introduction, let me say that I was the founding President of Holland College in Prince Edward Island, Canada, in 1969 – a community college that pioneered a flexible, competency based approach to organizing and delivering career education.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>the USA, Professor Robert Norton Ohio University, Columbus Ohio. Is also very familiar with my work and works in ternationally promoting practices learned from the model employed at Holland college.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In addition, a phone call to our Premier, Hon. Robert Ghiz, will provide context should you want further information about me.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If you read further you will realize two things: my views do not reflect those of most educators and I believe that the kind of change required in our education system will not come voluntarily from within.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>This letter, however, is triggered by the strike at York University but is not actually about that event. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Schools, colleges and universities are and should be teaching institutions; their role is to help learners learn. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In much the same way, the role of doctors, nurses and hospitals is to help people recover from illness and stay well.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Over the years, however, we’ve asked or allowed educational institutions to play the major role in sorting people and certifying their levels of educational achievement. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It’s like asking the family doctor to certify the level of health for workers’ compensation, new entrants to the RCMP, or an athlete’s readiness for the Olympics.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Teaching and sorting are separate functions and serve quite different purposes although practitioners use many of the same tools and techniques; in addition, in my view having the two functions in single institutions constitutes a conflict of interest.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>A better model, I believe, is to separate the two functions; let educational institutions help learners learn but establish a separate institution, a qualification authority, with the sole task of certifying levels of performance.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The City and Guilds of Britain is a long established example; the New Zealand Qualification Authority is another.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Persons seeking a qualification would apply and pay a fee to take an examination; the qualification authority determines the level of performance and awards the credential.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Such a qualification authority would be independent of the school system and would assess a person’s ability to perform regardless of when, where or how the person learned.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Such a model allows:</p>
<p>learners to learn in their own way and at their own pace, <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>people to challenge for credit whenever they are ready,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>people to flow into the workforce throughout the year not just in late spring,</p>
<p>portability of credentials across the country,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>for more flexible arrangements within institutions,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>some relief from the growing need for educational facilities since it is likely that there will be fewer learners in classrooms at any time</p>
<p>teachers and educational institutions to concentrate on teaching</p>
<p>if not encourages, more innovation in education.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>This proposal is based on my view that the single greatest barrier to educational reform is the stranglehold of educational institutions on two services – that of teaching and qualifications.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is not a proposal to reduce testing and assessment as a part of teaching but only to decouple or separate the two components</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>If this idea interests you, I would be delighted to elaborate further; iif not, I have not was consumed much of your time.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
