<div class="reader-summary">(157 words):** Don analyzes school staffing&#x27;s administrative rigidity, arguing single-teacher-per-classroom persists despite limited educational justification. He advocates differentiated staffing expanding adult contact hours through paraprofessional support, citing successful examples: the Trump Plan, Bishop Carroll School, Washington High School (which improved from bottom-ranked to third through aide expansion and 14-to-7 position conversion). Don proposes professional-titled support roles—instructors, coaches, tutors, coordinators, technologists—trained for specific responsibilities. Health-field models demonstrate effectiveness: doctors direct; nurses, therapists, technologists deliver. Education could adopt similar structures with clearly differentiated roles. Don argues this approach improves service while potentially reducing costs. He questions traditional assumptions: do schools need principals? Technologists? Corridor monitors? This vision influenced Holland College&#x27;s team approach to instruction and Don&#x27;s critique of rigid educational hierarchies perpetuated by administrative convenience rather than learning effectiveness.</div>

<p><b>14-Differentiated Staffing</b></p>
<p>}'</p>

<p>Early schools began with teachers, often-itinerant ones, and teaching students in any convenient location. To me, this conjures up a teacher standing or sitting under a tree while rapt students sit "at his feet" soaking up every word. Over time, the concept grew and a century ago the one -room country school became a mainstay of most communities. I went to one of these schools and distinctly remember listening to instruction intended for older students and, on occasion, even interrupting to answer a teacher's question. Later came multi-room schools, in some cases with teachers operating just as independently as if they were still in a one-room school. The idea of one teacher per class and classroom is still prevalent today. Change comes slowly in any business especially in one as conservative as education.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>A typical secondary school, I am told, is likely to have a principal, vice principal</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Sometimes it seems as though we have lost sight of the reason for schools and decided to operate them in a manner that is administratively convenient regardless on the effect on learners. Staffing patterns is one example. Teacher student ratios are set and there is little opportunity to experiment with alternatives. As a result, schools are top heavy with full-time professional teachers and light on part-time teachers and professional support Although teacher aides are used, from my knowledge, they are mostly limited to working with students with special needs.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>If one looks at other service organizations, one finds a significant growth of wellqualified support statT, some would call them paraprofessionals. Legal offices and churches are but two examples. Many professions have expanded the use of paraprofessionals - doctors, dentists and accountants are examples with their use of nurses, receptionists and assistants. Even our churches are accepting the concept of team ministry. Education has been a holdout in sticking to one teacher for class.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I am of view that increasing e the adult-learner contact hours in schools would lead to an improvement in the service we offer. I disagree, however, that we simply add more teachers. Learners could benefit from a different staffing pattern.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>My earliest contact with the idea differentiated staffing was the Trump plan of fifty years ago which envisaged open classrooms, flexible scheduling, large/small/ groups and individual instruction, mini courses and a team of people consisting of a teachers and a number of aides assisting with administration, administrative duties, corridor and playground supervision and the use of technology.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p>My most recent contact was a visit to Washington High School, Glendale, Arizona in February 1995. While my notes on the visit are less than complete, they show a school of 1,500 students in a middle class district offering Grades 9-12. The school had 73 faculty members. One thing I recall from my visit was the use of teaching assistants. Seven teaching positions were converted to 14 teacher aide positions. This dramatically increased the student contact hours with an adult helper. The second recollection was the dramatic change ofrankings of the school in the District. Over a 3-year period, Washington High School moved from the bottom of the rankings for high schools in the district to number 3; they were aiming for number one.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Bishop Carroll School was a beacon of innovation at the secondary school level in the 1970's and 1980's and had, as I recall, some classroom assistants.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>For differentiated staffing to succeed, there must be a clear differentiation in roles between the teacher and support staff I see the health field as a model in which the treatment of a patient is under the direction of a doctor but many components are actually delivered by nurses, therapists, laboratory technologists and others. Roles for support staff in education could include classroom administration, preparation of curriculum materials, supervision of corridors and playgrounds, operation of computers and related equipment, some testing and keeping of school records.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The roles of teachers and teacher aides must be differentiated and clearly defined in writing. Teacher aides is not an appropriate term I would not call them aides; give them a clear, professional name such as instructor, coach, tutor, curriculum developer, class coordinator, field worker, group leader, etcetera may well be a variety of support staff including information technologist, corridor monitor, playground monitor, instructional specialist, tutor. Etc. different schools may have a different mix of support staff Roles must be clear and meaningful and people filling the roles need to be specially trained for them.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>A commitment to outcomes based education is a requirement of Washington High School in Glendale, Arizona. This makes sense abut should not pose problems in many schools since many Departments of Education already mandate a CBE model.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>If one were starting from scratch to staff a school of, say 500 students, how many and what kind of staff would one need? Forthis activity, we should ignore current regulations and agreements. Do we need both a principal? With use of technology, do we need a "techie?" What about playground and corridor aides? Does everyone have to be full time?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
