  Governance Presentation on Governance
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Notes for presentation to PEI Education Governance Commission reflecting on Holland College governance model relevance to public schools. Opens with concern about imprecise language—commission uses &quot;education,&quot; &quot;education system,&quot; and &quot;school system&quot; interchangeably while excluding colleges, universities, private schools, faith schools, early childhood, business training. Don cautions against oversimplified &quot;partnerships&quot; concept; school leadership involves delegation but not partnership between minister, trustees, teachers, or students. Advocates for professional teacher partnerships instead. Draws directly on Holland College experience: 1969 planning committee chose Board of Governors over provincial management model (unlike most Atlantic sister institutions). After 40 years, Don concludes College &quot;would have been quite a different institution&quot; with provincial model—demonstrates governance model importance. Emphasizes key to improvement is learner-teacher interaction quality; every recommendation should ask &quot;How will this improve learner experience? How do I know?&quot; Advocates for clear written operating principles. Recommends Alberta&#x27;s diversity model (private schools, teacher-led schools like Palmer Park Detroit, charter schools, Crown corporation, unique models) as examples. Proposes considering Board of Governors model for public schools. Concludes with Ainley-McKenzie research on governance.</div>

<p><b>Notes for a</b></p>
<p><b>Presentation to the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>

<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li3">Opening comments</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li3">My reading of the discussion paper left me somewhat unclear as to the precise focus of the study.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Just because I am confused doesn’t mean that others are confused, however, I believe in something as important as this clarity is important<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Commission documents use the term education, education system and school system as though they were one and the same. On examination, however there was no mention of the college or university education or publicly operated literacy programs, private schools, faith based schools, early childhood development or training provided by organizations or businesses for their own employees. I now know that it applies only to the public<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>schools system. Some definitions would have been helpful, but I do thank you for your response to my query on the subject</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li3">That clarification, however, left me wondering about the reference in Commission documents to “partners and partnerships.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>While I fully understand that education is a partnership between the home, school, church, youth organizations, and others, in my view, the running of schools is not a partnership.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The minister is the responsible leader of an organization who has delegated certain functions to School trustees and to his employees, but neither trustees, teachers, administrators are partners.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I think of students as clients, not partners.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Obviously,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>the operation of a school system requires consultation in many forms and with many groups but that is consultation and cooperation not partnerships.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>At the same time, I think that professional teacher partnerships deserve consideration and would be both less frustrating and more rewarding than the current model.</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li3">It may be of interest to know that the Committee charged with planning Holland College in 1969 wrestled at some length with the question of governance for the new institution.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Most of the sister institutions in Atlantic Canada were operated by provincial governments in much the same way as the public school system.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Ontario Colleges and some in British Columbia on the other hand operated under boards of Governors.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The Holland College Planning committee opted for a unicameral Board.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>At the time, it was not an issue about which I had strong feelings, however, I am absolutely convinced that the College you have today had the decision favoured a provincially run institution.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Based on this experience alone, I recommend that schools be given maximum freedom to go about the task of helping learners learn</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li3">The key to improving our school system is to improve what takes place when learner and teacher meet.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>For every recommendation you make, therefore, you should ask two questions.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“How will this improve a learner’s educational experience and How do I know?</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li3">I am a great believer in the value of clear and written operating principles to guide decision-making.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The infant Holland College had such a paper and it became a reference in our decision-making.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When the your report is finalized, that is the first item I will look for a set of guiding principles.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>British Columbia has a study of its education now under way.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The guidelines are clear.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>What is being proposed must “<span>A reform plan announced Friday by Education Minister George Abbott would also promote personalized learning, critical thinking and quality teaching,</span></li>

</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I am an advocate of change in the way we deliver education and, therefore, welcome the Minister’s announcement that a review of school governance is planned.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Needs are diverse and the delivery system should encourage, and be able to accommodate, a variety of providers. <span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Government’s role is to provide leadership, standards and resources – and then get out of the way.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The Province of Alberta appears to include the greatest range of diversity within its school system, and Alberta learners consistently garner high test results.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Is there a connection? I don’t know. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The number of administrative units, whether one or five, will in itself do little to improve the quality of education. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>What school boards need is greater freedom and accountability; the same could be said for teachers.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My scan of delivery systems includes the following:</p>
<p><br></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li3">Private schools<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></li>
  <li class="li3">Teacher led schools such as Palmer Park in Detroit, MSLA in Denver, Colorado, or similar arrangements in Milwaukee, Minnesota, Boston and elsewhere.</li>
  <li class="li3">Charter school – Alberta has, I believe, a dozen.</li>
  <li class="li3">The Edmonton Model although details are not clear to me at this time</li>
  <li class="li3">A Crown corporation may give a government the control it wants and education the freedom it requires</li>
  <li class="li3">Creating a model unique<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>to PEI<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p>In 1969, the College Planning Committee opted for a Board of Governors; it appears to have worked.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Forty years later I am convinced that Holland College would have been quite a different institution had the College Planning Committee chosen, instead, to follow the governance model in place in sister provinces.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>So, why not consider the College model for our public schools? <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p><b>CONCLUSION</b></p>
<p>Research on school governance is concerned with more than where decisions are made. It is</p>
<p>concerned with the package of arrangements that constitute the framework within which teaching</p>
<p>and learning occurs. Elements of that framework include the way the curriculum is organised,</p>
<p>financial management, personnel management and resource allocation. In an early part of these</p>
<p>paper it was noted that decentralisation could occur with respect to any or all of these elements.</p>
<p>Research that has linked decentralisation by itself to student learning outcomes has not suggested</p>
<p>large effects. However, decentralisation is often implemented as part of a package of changes.</p>
<p>Where this package forms part of an integrated governance structure in which the central authority</p>
<p>has responsibility for defining curriculum, monitoring quality and intervening as necessary the</p>
<p>results are more promising.</p>
