  100 -5 OverhaulI
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Editor letter addressing changing world creating increased pressure for education services beyond traditional diplomas/degrees. Proposes conceptualizing education services as &quot;education pharmacy or hospital&quot; model where individuals seek targeted educational support—paralleling Holland College Board motion (August 1969) authorizing diverse training delivery. Notes provincial historical leadership role (with federal role in education-for-work through agreements) now diminished, leaving education institutions unable to respond to broadened service demands in era of job-changing and gig economy.</div>

<p><b>Education Needs an Overhaul</b></p>
<p>It seems that most weeks produce a new set of educational problems if not issues – math tests for teachers in Ontario, curriculum overhaul in Alberta, math levels of nurses in Manitoba, grade inflation, shortage of construction workers in PEI, high cost of university study, impact of poverty on student performance, and the list goes on.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The gap between education services desired and education services provided continues to grow.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></p>
<p>Changing nature of work increases pressure<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>for service education but fe<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It seemmsAs an observer, Departments seem to have adopted narrow views and,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>iit seems has focused on education products, namely diplomas and degrees.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>But the world we live in has changed dramatically; education products are not enough.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There is a dramatic increase in the need for education services – information, counselling, education products,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>short term instruction and support.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Education institutions lack capacity to respond</p>
<p>What might tomorrows education service look like? Well. I see it as an educational pharmacy or hospital, or some combination thereof, where one may be referred or check in for educational support.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In writing this, I am reminded of<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>a motion approved by the Holland College Board of<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Governers in, I think, August 1969 which gave the President to offer raining of any kind provided it was legal and funded.</p>

<p>Historically, Provinces provided leadership and direction<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>to public education and trustees actually delivered programs; education for work was the domain of federal governments<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>and through a series of federal-provincial<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>agreements Federal dollars and federal criteria guided both the quantity and quality of education for work <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
