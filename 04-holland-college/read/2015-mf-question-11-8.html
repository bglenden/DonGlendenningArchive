<p><b>QUESTION 11A -PURPOSES AND ACTIVITIES<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b>For application to CRA for charitable status</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>APPROVED PURPOSES</b></p>
<p>The purposes of Education 20/20 Inc. as included in our incorporation documents are as follows:</p>
<p>1 To promote education and educational opportunity for every Canadian</p>
<p>2 To exercise leadership in the improvement in all facets of education</p>
<p>3 To foster cooperation between and among all stakeholders</p>
<p>4 Undertake and support research and innovation</p>
<p>5 improve public understanding of the education system</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>As part of the process of preparing this application, we reviewed and revised the objectives as found in our incorporation documents to better reflect our interests and plans. The review and rewriting have benefitted the organization; based on our experience since our incorporation and future plans, we propose the following objectives:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>A)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><b>ADVANCE EDUCATION BY ORGANIZING LEADERSHIP DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES FOR PEOPLE WHO PLAN, ADMINISTER AND DELIVER EDUCATION PROGRAMS.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><span><b>Recent Workshops</b></span></p>
<p>In the past year, Education 20/20 offered a number of workshops; all have been of 2 hours duration, led by volunteers, held in the late afternoon or<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>evening and included a presentation and round table discussions.</p>
<p><br></p>

<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span><b>Planned workshops</b></span></p>
<p>Commitments have been made, but dates not yet confirmed, for the following workshops in 2015:</p>
<p>1)<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span><span>The State of On-line Courses</span> by Dave Cormier, Director of Computer Services at<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>the University of Prince Edward Island and a leading expert in MOOCs<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>2) <span>Handle With Care</span>, by Alice Taylor, PEI Partner, Handle with Care Program and a Director of Education 20/20 Inc.</p>
<p>3) <span>Research Findings on Youth</span>, by Dr. Kate Tilleczek, Chair, Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council Research Lab at UPEI</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span><b>Webinars</b></span></p>
<p>There is a large unserved and even growing body of people engaged in education outside public institutions; I refer to a dozen agencies on PEI part of whose educational programs have been accepted by the Department of Education for external credits, some private schools, home schooling parents, employer based training and a number of organizations receiving funding to mount programs for underserved youth.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Education 20/20 Inc. plans to offer a series of webinar-style 3-5 minute video clips for use by educators either alone or in groups.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Our first series, “A Learning Framework” is under development and consists of four sessions (1) <b>Learners which </b>provides background as to why learners differ, (2) <b>Learning:</b> sheds light on what happens when a person learns, (3) <b>Levels of Learning</b>: presents options on the meaning of levels of achievement, and (4) <b>The Learning Path which </b>follows a learner through a learning cycle.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Involved in the first series are: Presenter Donald Glendenning, CM, PhD; Henry Purdy, CM, CRA, and Sara Underwood, Office of Alumni Relations at Holland College. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span><b>Work with employers:</b></span></p>
<p>About a year ago, the Community Foundation of Prince Edward Island conducted a survey of over 200 young people to better understand their issues.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>(<span>www.cfpei.ca</span>). On reviewing their report, Education 20/20 was struck by the “preparedness gap”, that is the preparedness of young people for further education and for work. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Early in 2014, Education 20/20 Inc. organized workshops in six communities across the Island to publicize the findings, determine the extent of the concern, and identify actions, if any, that could or should be taken. Perhaps the most significant finding was the lack of communication about educational matters between providers and users of educational services.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Employers and post-secondary institutions use high school graduation as a requirement for entrance to postsecondary institutions and to work, but tell us that having such a document is no longer adequate evidence of an acceptable level of basic or essential skills.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This is not surprising since teachers often report that in most class, student grade levels range from 2-3 grade levels above<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>to 2-3 grade levels below the nominal level of the class.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In other words, it is not unusual for have students whose math level is Grade 7 or lower and others with math levels of Grade 11 or higher.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Transcripts and diplomas do not tell the difference.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Education 20/20 has a small committee exploring the issue but has not been able to find well defined and broadly accepted achievement levels on school subjects.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Work is continuing</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span><b>Other providers of educational services</b></span></p>
<p><span><b></b></span><br></p>
<p>We are all familiar with schools, colleges and universities as providers of educational services; we are less familiar with, and often overlook, the many other providers of educational services including youth organizations, cadet programs, sports development programs, the private sector and a range of NGO’s.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>More to the point, staff in these groups is seldom included in conferences, workshops or other educational activities.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We have made contact with a number of community based training agencies such as <span>Skills PEI</span>, <span>Workplace Learning PEI</span>, <span>Bridges </span>and some private trainers; some already participate in current<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>activities of Education 20/20.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>With the initiative by the Department of Education to increase credit for external courses, we see an increased opportunity and an obligation to help.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Although the dialogue is open, we have not undertaken yet any programs specifically designed to meet their needs. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Schools not only certify they also sort; by sorting we mean issue credentials (Diplomas and Degrees)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Some see the issue as a conflict of interest others simply believe that<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>schools have lost their ability to sort.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We are working with the local Chamber to resolve the issue.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It appears that the assessment services through the <span>Holland College Assessment Centre</span> and <span>Workplace Learning PEI</span> will be able to provide the required services.<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>The committee is also exploring the idea of a separate certification arrangement similar to that provided by the Royal Canadian Conservatory of Music under which teachers teach but the conservatory certifies.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>B) ADVANCE EDUCATION THROUGH INCREASING THE AMOUNT AND FLOW OF INFORMATION AND IDEAS TO, BETWEEN AND AMONG EDUCATION PARTNERS</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>It takes an informed and engaged community to educate a child; evidence shows that students perform better in schools with a high degree of autonomy but also in schools where parents and the community work together; in PEI, during the last few months, the Department of Education has dramatically expanded the number of external credits.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Education 20/20 <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>believes that more needs to be done and that our organization can play an important role in (1) increasing the flow of information and (2) providing opportunities for “deliverers of educational services and “users of educational services” to dialogue. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span>A newsletter</span>, Open Education, is distributed electronically on a monthly basis to some 200 people; arrangements have been recently confirmed to produce it in both official languages.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>(Copies included with supporting documents)</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span>A Website</span>, <span>www.education2020.ca</span>, is used to announce events, post occasional papers, host newsletters and survey results; in other words will become a centre for managing our information activities including the social media.<span><b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></span></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><span>Conversation/dialogue</span></p>
<p>One of the conclusions resulting from our preparedness workshops mentioned elsewhere in this paper is the need for direct dialogue between education and the community it serves.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>To bridge the gap, we are organizing a series of discussions; each session will have a one page background paper, a presentation if appropriate, and followed by open discussion.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The objective is to increase communications rather than to reach agreement.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The pilot run of discussions will begin in early 2015 between 4:30 and 6:00 pm with a group not to exceed 20 people; additional groups will be organized if numbers warrant. (Copy of invitation included with supporting documents)</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span><b>Formal presentations</b></span></p>
<p>It is important help policy makers become aware and up- to- date on issues about which they make policies.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In saying this, we are aware of, and have reviewed Policy CPS-022 (Effective date: September 2, 2003), and understand the limits placed on charitable organizations especially as they relate to lobbying and political activities</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>On September 25, 2014 Education 20/20 Inc. made a presentation to the English Language School Board on <span>Prior Learning Assessment and Recognition</span> during which we advocated for PLAR, Challenge for Credit and exemptions as a way of broadening studies, putting students in charge of at least some elements of their program, and increasing engagement.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>(Copy of presentation included with enclosed documents)</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>On September 30, 2014, Education 20/20 Inc. made a presentation to the Prince Edward Island Standing Committee on Education and Innovation on A <span>Framework for Decision-making</span>. (Copy included with enclosed documents)<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>We are seeking opportunities to address other bodies such as the Provincial Cabinet, the French Language School Board, Chambers of Commerce and Council of Maritime Premiers, MPHEC and others.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span><b>Working with the community at large</b></span></p>
<p>Parents play a pivotal role in the education of their children; children perform better when their parents and the community are engaged in the education process and yet, broadly speaking, the school system does not encourage deep engagement.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>To encourage engagement, Education 20/20 Inc. has instituted an award of Excellence to a school or learning centre that best demonstrates a high level of engagement in its day to day activities, especially those activities over which the school has control.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>(Announcements, descriptions and other supporting information provided with supporting documents). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b>We will continue to engage employers and educators in projects and panels to increase communication; service clubs will be encouraged to invite educators, especially principals, as speakers, and will make a special attempt to produce occasional papers and media releases about items of interest to them.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>(C) ADVANCE EDUCATION BY PROVIDING SUPPLEMENTAL EDUCATIONAL SUPPORT SERVICES</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>Education is a lifelong process; most of our educational funding, however, goes to institutions and for full-time instruction of the young.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Even at that, schools cannot, should not be expected to, supply all educational services for youth; neither can governments be expected to pay all educational costs.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There is a need for part time instruction and short courses but, even where they are available, offerings tends be limited to courses being offered to others on a full time basis.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Although technology has put knowledge building within easy reach of many adults, maintaining and progressing in the workplace may also require new skills and attitudes that can best be dealt with in group settings.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Partners in the education process also include the family, community agencies, sports groups, service clubs, NGO’s, private sector, and individuals, to name but a few; we are giving priority to the following<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>gaps:</p>
<p><br></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li5"><b>Study Centre(s)</b></li>
</ul>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>Many students need a place to study, to meet with a tutor, to access occasional help and to interact with other learners; Education 20/20 plans to provide such places.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As demand for services grow, we see the need for a full service study centre where youth can get customized help such as counselling, diagnosis, assessment and even referral. Our longer term plan is to expand the service to a number communities as demand requires and resources allow.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>At least at the beginning, tutors will be volunteers; space has been offered by the PEI Association of Professional Engineers; costs will be minimal and will be met through donations from individuals and businesses.</p>
<p><br></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li5"><b>Emerging fields</b> –<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p>Our world is dominated by technology.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Most computer users benefit from less than 10% of a program’s functionality.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There are contemporary computer languages that are learnable by virtually anyone.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Knowledge of a computer language not only helps us better use existing programs, but also enables us to start building some of our own tools, changing us from passive to active technology consumers.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We want open this door to more people, especially young people.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We are actively investigating introductory computer language courses on a part time basis available through fees or sponsorships at a cost of $100 per participant.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Robotics and 3-D printing are also on our list.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Success in school depends to a significant degree to the level of social and emotional development of people entering school; there is a need, we believe, to provide information and assistance to parents of pre-school students as to ways to ensure young people are provided with appropriate experiences.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>At the moment, we a re in active discussion with a view to offering the Handle-with-Care program, mentioned elsewhere in this document.</p>
<p><br></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li5"><b>Imagine experiences</b></li>
</ul>
<p>In the hurly burly of every say life, and especially in the context of school classrooms, there is seldom time for creativity.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We propose to provide such opportunities to Islanders of any age.</p>
<p><b>D)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>ADVANCE EDUCATION BY SUPPORTING RESEARCH AND INNOVATION, AND BY PROMOTING BEST PRACTICES IN THE FIELD OF EDUCATION AND TRAINING</b></p>
<p>Education 20/20 Inc. realizes the importance research and innovation and will encourage research and researchers through publicizing research findings, identifying and promoting underserved areas, and featuring researchers in our public sessions.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Existing research, it seems to us, focuses almost exclusively on institution based education, early childhood, the young and literacy. We believe that other issues also could benefit from additional research such as the role of credentials and qualifications, determining levels of achievement in key subjects, choice in education, delivery options, alternatives to age level grouping and continuing education</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Survey of Interests and needs</b></p>
<p>We recognize the importance of surveys of educational stakeholders and, in fact, think that surveys results contribute to improving the quality of a product or service, and are especially important for delivery organizations, such as education, that lack choice.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Education 20/20 plans to undertake surveys; the first planned for 2015 is a survey of stakeholder views on the goals of public education as published on the Department of Education website.; we start with goals because they are a basic direction- setting activity, and are<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>We plan a series of occasional papers, short papers on issues related to any aspect of education.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Papers may report research findings, best practices, innovations, and points of view.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Papers will be aimed at the general public and be widely available electronically.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Occasional papers provide information and views on a variety of subjects but also provide an opportunity, and even encouragement, to people to clarify their views and “grow’ in their chosen field. The first is a brief report on a series of workshops held throughout the Province earlier this year. Another, on Charter Schools, arises from a request following a public meeting, a third responds at least in part, to providing a framework making decisions about education.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>(Copies of some papers, not yet released, are included with our supporting documents). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
