<div class="reader-summary">Introduction by Don Glendenning to &quot;The Glendenning Letters&quot; (April 15, 2014) describing his educational background as a &quot;sandwich education&quot; spanning 20 years with alternating layers of study and teaching, supplemented by summer schools. He details his career progression through elementary, secondary, and principal roles, teacher training, and federal government positions before becoming founding president of Holland College. Don explains his choice to write letters to editors rather than academic journals, believing systemic education change comes from citizen and parent pressure rather than internal system reform. He collected 62 published letters and notes many unpublished drafts. The introduction emphasizes public discourse over traditional academic publishing as his contribution to education debate.</div>

<p>Dear Reader:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>The Glendenning Letters</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>Mine was a sandwich education spread over 20 years after high school graduation. A layer of</p>
<p>Study, perhaps a year or two, followed by a layer of teaching, then another layer of study and so</p>
<p>on, all seasoned with endless summer schools. As a result, I ended up with experience as a</p>
<p>teacher in both the elementary and secondary levels, a principal, six years a teacher</p>
<p>trainer and the same as a training specialist with the Federal government. During the same</p>
<p>period I earned several degrees, and held licenses to teach both academic and vocational</p>
<p>subjects. That sandwich nourished me in my role as Founding President of Holland College, a</p>
<p>community college established in Prince Edward lsland to broaden the range of educational</p>
<p>services available to lslanders. I write this only to support the view that my sandwich was</p>
<p>custom made, was somewhat unique and may result in a different perspective.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>For a number of years I wrote a column for the Canadian Vocational Journal. ln 1995 I wrote my first letter to the Editor of the Charlottetown Guardian; it was about education in Atlantic</p>
<p>Canada and is the first letter in the pages that follow. That letter was a simple response to an</p>
<p>item of interest; 18 years later with our education system under scrutiny and pressure to</p>
<p>change, a friend suggested that these letters be brought together and made available to the</p>
<p>public as a stimulus for discussion. This volume is the result.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I found or reconstructed some 62 letters, all of which were actually published; there were</p>
<p>perhaps a half dozen not included because they were short and congratulatory notes, were not</p>
<p>about education, were sent to a different newspaper, or may not have been published. I also</p>
<p>found an equal number of letters in various stages of readiness; some of the latter look more</p>
<p>interesting than the published ones. Most of the letters would have benefitted from editing,</p>
<p>rewriting or even not having been written at all but I decided to include them anyway. I</p>
<p>suppose I shouldn't have been surprised by number that were repeats.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Readers may wonder why I write letters to the editor instead of writing for educational journals.</p>
<p>The answer is twofold, I do not consider myself a writer neither do I have the interest or</p>
<p>discipline to write a book. But secondly, I am of the view that the changes required in</p>
<p>education are not likely to come from within the system but rather will result from demands for</p>
<p>change arising from interested parents, citizens, students, employers t and the public at large.</p>
<p>Putting these letters in circulation is, I believe a contribution to that debate.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>My thanks to all who, over the years, contributed to the ideas expressed herein; I hope they</p>
<p>contribute as much to your education as they did to mine.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Don Glendenning \</p>
