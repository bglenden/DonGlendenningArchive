  Shopping around for education
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Inspired by local newspaper reference to &quot;shopping around&quot; for early childhood programs, Don questions why similar choice doesn&#x27;t exist in public K-12 education. He notes we freely choose churches, professionals, and merchants but lack school choice for our children and no teacher selection. Don advocates allowing parents to &quot;shop around&quot; for K-12 schooling, acknowledging implementation difficulty but affirming possibility and desirability. This brief but powerful essay positions educational choice as fundamental consumer right with precedent in early childhood and higher education. It reflects Don&#x27;s consistent advocacy for expanded learner/family agency within education systems. The column is signed by Don as President Emeritus of Holland College.</div>

<p><b>Shopping around for education</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>When I travel I am a regular reader of local papers whether at a restaurant where we stop for lunch or where we overnight, and I have a special interest in articles about education and schooling.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Concerns for quality appear almost daily in news items, editorials and letters to the editor.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Suggestions for improvement are almost universal, smaller classes, curriculum changes, better qualified teachers, longer school days or school years and more standardized testing.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The Charlottetown Guardian of March 31, 2005 referred to “shopping around” for early childhood education programs.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Then it struck me.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If shopping around is acceptable for early childhood education and for college and university studies, why not allow it in the public school system?</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Stop and think for a moment, we can choose our church, dentist, lawyer, mechanic, mayor, shoe store and doctor but we have limited choice of schools our children attend and no choice in their teachers. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I believe that the time has come to allow parents to “shop around” for the schooling of their children.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Implementation of the concept won’t be easy but it is possible – and desirable.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
