  87 Schools without walls
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Don recounts visiting Philadelphia&#x27;s &quot;School Without Walls&quot; in the 1970s, inspired by a Life magazine advertisement. The school located classes throughout the city in libraries, galleries, churches, and available spaces rather than in traditional buildings, with teachers&#x27; first task being to secure meeting space. Don reflects that while interesting then, schools without walls are now more feasible given internet information access, competency-based education, performance assessment, computers, and individual learner management systems. He proposes two implementation scenarios: apprenticeship programs using competency analyses with learning managers (unlike teachers, more akin to physicians) who identify needs, create learning plans, secure opportunities, and provide feedback. The learning manager contracts specialized instruction and arranges apprenticeship testing and placement with employers. Similar models could work for mathematics, communication, history, art, and music.</div>

<p>Readers who r member wRerrLif~gazine ~'Pt~heg weekly~ may also recall some &lt;.-Rtf the striking advertisements carried therein. One that I recall vividly, and one that always intrigued me was the one promoting -."SchooF"Without Walls". As I recall, it was an academic high school following the regular schoQI curriculum and located in the city of Philadelphia. '</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Back in the 1970's, I was at a conference in Washington, DC. And took an extra day to visit the "School Without Walls". It was my first and only visit to Philadelphia. I still recall the visit; I remember the raw, damp day as I visited some of the historic area of the City and also the elusive "school without walls". There wasn't much to see buLt.h~ &gt;+.</p>
<p>was an interesting concept.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I found the address; it led me to a rather ordinary office building. This was the Principal's officc tmcl ths administrative centre. It was small; in fact the school was small. By that I mean that there were very few students in the }(school. Students, on the other hand, were scattered throughout the city. I did not actually see any students on that visit - they were, as the name suggests, somewhere around the city.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The first task of a teacher, I was told, was to find space to mee1'ihe class. Depending on the subject taught, some met in libraries, art galleries, churches, and other available spaces. Classes were quite traditional but the classroom was unique. If my recollection serves me well, school laboratories were~l&lt;?r the science classes.

<p><br></p>
<p>Times have changed since that visit and changes in education make schools without walls much more feasible. In saying this, I am thinking about such things as accessibil~-Gl s~'" c ~ t information via the internet, impact of competency based education, perfo~e based ,l.....r [(~- i W&lt; /l assessment, administrative enhancements using computers, a systemjocidentifying L.-.;~ ~"- i. J.. (&gt; ~ competencies, learning managers and the ability to deliver su~ individual learners. 7 .</p>
<p>These were not available three decades ago. How mighLit""work? There are a number of scenarios; let me det1rt1 two. ", /...,/,., Ct. i&lt;k-'S.</p>

<p><br></p>
<p>One other is needed and that is a learning manager. This is a different from a teacher and may be likened to a family physician. The role is to work with individual learners identifying needs, setting up learning plans, finding or creating learning opportunities, providing encouragement and feedback. The learning manager will also do some onvenr<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p><br></p>
<p>An open school in carpentry,:D example, may operate something li is. Let's start with a learning manager- a p, rson with recent, extensive and var' experience in the field including experience t the supervisory level. Next rev' the analysis to see that it is competency based, an the iavailable resource material . ~Arrange mitb. the Apprenticeship officers for..ther learne:t5to be tested for the various levels of apprenticeship on demand (and for a fee). It is likely, that all beginning apprentices should be able to use basic hand and power tools, and practice safe working procedures. The learning manager may teach some of these skills himself or he may simply contract them out to a school or employer. This is done on an individual basis. The contract is monitored.</p>
<p>~'i As part of the contracting arrangement, the lea . g manager must specify the competencies and levels of performance. Th earning manager will meet learners both individually and collectively as required. e will also liaise wit~providing the actual instruction. With basic training in equipment and safety, the learner may then be placed with an employer for a fee and new learning plans laid out. When the learner wishes to establish his performance level, he presents himself to the apprenticeship Branch, pays ~ fee ~nd un~ertak~s the assessment process: "&amp; t"'~ ~ ~&lt;'.r&gt;.,}~.

<p>The process for mathematics, communIcation skills, history or art would not be significantly different. Education in music and the arts wold be a natural with which to experiment.</p>
