  Time the variable
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">An educational essay by Don arguing that learning rates vary among students and that time rather than learning should be the constant variable. He draws on examples from his teacher training, personal observation, England, and Holland College&#x27;s independent scheduling approach, advocating for individualized pacing to ensure fairness and success.</div>

<p>About Education</p>
<p><b>MAKE LEARNING THE CONSTANT<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>INFORMATION NEEDED</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>We are told that each person learns at his or her own rate. Not only did I learn that in my teacher training classes but I found it with my own children. It also came up a few days ago when talking about education with a fellow Islander.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He has kids in school; not sure the age but would guess in high school. He wondered why his children had to study the same subject at the same time as their classmates.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Grades and time-based classes Guarantee a range of grades at the end of a semester or year, and almost guarantee that some students will fail. In fact, I’ve visited classes where teachers have pointed out students up to four grades ahead or behind in a math class.</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Many years ago, in England I visited a secondary school which in recognition of differences in rates of learning, offered mathematics as a first class each morning so that students could get the math they needed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In its early years, most Holland College students were on an independent schedule that included independent starting dates as well. Secretarial Studies was nominally an 18-month program.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>An informal review showed that some4 t students gained a similar profile of skills in about 14 months. The literature tells us that increasingly student individual rates are being accommodated. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>It is patently unfair to students to do anything different.</b></p>
