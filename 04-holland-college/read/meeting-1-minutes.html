  Meeting 1 Minutes 
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Official minutes from the November 25, 2015 stakeholder meeting chaired by Don Glendenning, attended by representatives from Holland College, UPEI, the Department of Education, employers, literacy advocates, and community members. Key discussion points: confirmation that education&#x27;s purpose includes preparing citizens; acknowledgment that the &quot;preparedness gap&quot; is poorly defined, with employers identifying specific deficits in customer service, reading cursive, mathematics, and numeracy; Don&#x27;s observation that no master list of required mathematics and communication skills exists; recognition that both academic and soft skills gaps exist; estimated 15-20% of young people experience the gap; discussion of systemic constraints (teacher training, class size/composition, socioeconomic factors). The meeting demonstrates Don&#x27;s facilitation skills and systematic problem-framing approach.</div>

	<b>Notes:</b></p>
	<ol>
		<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">The
		chair welcomed those present, confirmed the purpose to be an
		“exploration of the “preparedness gap” as identified in the
		CFPEI youth survey in 2013; during his remarks, the chair noted
		that those invited were, by and large, people he had spoken with
		about the subject but it is likely that other people would be
		interested and should be added to the list.</p></li>
		<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Those
		present seemed to agree that a goal of education is to prepare
		young people for citizenship.</p></li>
		<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">In
		summary:</p></li>
	</ol>
	<ul>
		<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">The
		gap is not well defined; the GCACC presentation to  Government
		identified the following problem areas, inability to perform
		face-to-face customer interactions, inability to read cursive
		writing, lack of math skills required for measuring and cutting in
		construction, and inability to count</p></li>
		<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Don
		mentioned that he had searched for master list of mathematics and
		communication skills but neither was found; such a list, he
		suggested, could be useful to schools, colleges, universities, and
		employers when communicating about what students know and are able
		to do.</p></li>
		<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">It
		is likely that the shortfall includes both academic and soft
		skills; brief mention was made of Employability Skills which
		includes both.</p></li>
		<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">We
		do not have estimates of the number of people experiencing the gap
		although the figure of 15-20 percent was floated.</p></li>
		<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Steve
		and Roger commented on the need for simplicity and clarity</p></li>
	</ul>
	<ol start="4">
		<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Tom
		White-Hassler briefly described a community survey on education
		that he had conducted while working in Alaska.</p></li>
		<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">It
		was pointed out that teachers are under pressure by the range of
		student differences, student interests, socio-economic background,
		home conditions and financial resources.  This brought comments
		about the importance of students being able to connect their
		learning to their needs and resulting pressures on the system to
		customize services.</p></li>
		<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">The
		school system is also constrained by the labour contract,
		especially by the issues of class size and composition. (Editor:
		Recently a BC court ruled that neither class size nor class
		composition are negotiable; the ruling is being appealed to the
		Supreme Court of Canada.)</p></li>
		<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">At
		the end of the meeting, several participants expressed an interest
		it knowing about the roles of people at the table; we will make
		that item one on the agenda of our next meeting</p></li>
		<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Attendees
		commented on the usefulness of the exchange and a willingness to
		meet again; this was attested to by the fact that the conversation
		continued well after the meeting closed.</p></li>
		<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">The
		Chair thanked all for their attendance and Roger Birt for the use
		if a meeting room as well as the coffee and cookies</p></li>
		<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Meeting
		closed at 10:30 am</p></li>
		<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Next
		meeting at the call of the chair.</p></li>
