  D-functional analysis  
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Don addresses the &quot;culture of fear&quot; reportedly pervasive in PEI public education, citing Donald Savoie&#x27;s &quot;What Government is Good At&quot; for context. While he personally hasn&#x27;t experienced pressure to silence his views, he&#x27;s encountered government-dependent contractors reluctant to engage with Education 20/20 Inc. due to fear of professional repercussions. He parallels this to Holland College&#x27;s founding: the 1968-69 College Planning Committee recommended unicameral boards for community colleges rather than provincial creatures of government, resulting in colleges able to focus mission rather than feed bureaucracy. He advocates functional analysis showing that provincial direct operation of schools creates the problems; provinces should instead adopt support and encouragement roles. Proposes management consulting intervention to broaden departmental mandate from operational control to leadership functions.</div>

<p>Editor,</p>

<p>Charlottetown, PEI	</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Dear Sir:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>A culture of fear</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>People often mention a “culture of fear” in public education; if that’s so, we should do something about it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Having read Donald Savoie’s recent book, <span>What Government is good at</span>, I have a better understanding of that concern.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Personally, I’ve not encountered any pressure to withhold my point of view.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>On the other hand, I have encountered people who, because they depend upon government for contracts, feel that they should refrain from being active in Education 20.20 Inc.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As one retired official said, “If a person plans to live and work in the field of education on PEI, don’t expect them to come to your meetings.” <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The matter of governance was an issue with the College Planning Committee in 1968-69; at that time, community colleges throughout the Region were creatures of Provinces; the College Planning Committee thought otherwise and recommended a unicameral Board; the Government accepted the recommendation.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The result was a College free to focus on its mission rather than using its energy to feed the bureaucracy.</p>
<p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>From my perspective, most of the problems in education today spring from the fact that Provinces run schools directly rather than perform roles that encourage and support education for its citizens; to check this out, simply do a functional analysis and compare it with the current organizational chart for the Department.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The difference soon becomes obvious.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>If the Department were to<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>broaden its mandate, the advice of a management consulting firm would be in order.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
