  D An opportunity
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Don positions PEI&#x27;s move to a single school board as an opportunity to implement governance reform. He argues schools shouldn&#x27;t be run by government, advocating instead for delegation to teachers as professionals (comparable to doctors and lawyers), school autonomy, and closer decision-maker-to-stakeholder relationships. He references Holland College&#x27;s 1969 Board of Governors model as successful precedent for delegated governance. The letter demonstrates Don&#x27;s belief that structural governance changes enable operational improvements and his institutional knowledge from college leadership.</div>

<p>Dear Sir:</p>
<p>A Leadership Opportunity</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The Editorial in the Guardian on Saturday, July 14 and Tom Connor’s letter of July 19 address the need for new thinking and new approaches in education.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Today, as I write, my inbox contains a new message linking quality performance and local budget control.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Delegation not only reflects good management but also sends a signal to the community that their views are being heard.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The decision should be taken now; delaying it until a new Board is in place gains nothing and penalizes students.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Having new trustees first learn an old process before converting to the new one defies logic.</p>
<p>ow in school.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>delays the start of Making the decision now will hasten The decision tom delegate should be made nowThe basic decision needs to be taken now, details can follow.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>An early announcement The poThe principle should be taken and announced now;<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>so that the new Board After all, if government doesn’t listen why should employees be expected to do so?</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>gnals a change in thinkingets a good example to , evidence supports Evidence supports their views .<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>the ball is now in governments court.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>By taking this step,Often educators are blamed for being unwilling to change; we now have an opportunity for our government demonstrate their willingness to lead the way.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>How can we e.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Evidence supports the The “golden opportunity’ to institute change should not be wasted.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>provides even more detail fills in some detail.The upcoming move to a single School Board provides an opportunity for a significant streamlining in the way we conduct our education business and, if evidence based, should improvement the quality of education available to Islanders.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My Taking advantage of the opportunity, however, requires both leadership and thinking outside the traditional education box.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I say this for three reasons:</p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li1">First and foremost, schools should not be run by government; government has an important role but it is not that of hiring and supervising teachers.</li>
  <li class="li1">Delegating – the authority to make decisions about learners and learning should, for the most part, be delegated to teachers; as professionals, they should be given ta level of freedom and accountability of medical doctors an lawyers, for example.</li>
  <li class="li1">Autonomy – there is evidence of positive link between student learning and the autonomy of the school authority.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Moving to a single Board should simplify the changeover.</li>
  <li class="li1">Narrowing the gap between the governors and the governed, the decision maker<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>and the person affected, should dramatically improve communication, so crucial to learning</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>While governance may not be your priority, I urge you to take an interest and to let your views be known.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We’ll likely not have such an opportunity for many years to come.</p>
<p>And, if you want to share your ideas with me, you may do so at standards2020@gmail.com. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p>Sincerely</p>
