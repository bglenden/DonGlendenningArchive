  Grades and grading 
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Detailed analysis of assessment, grading, and ranking in education systems. Don distinguishes assessment (feedback-focused) from grading (standardized achievement measurement). Notes that most developed countries except US and Canada separate teaching and grading functions. Proposes that grades should reflect competency achievement, inform students and parents, represent individual achievement, and motivate improvement. Emphasizes that grading standards should vary by competency and purpose. Argues that ranking is not an education function and that established qualification authorities (like those in other developed nations) better communicate education results. Reflects his experience with Holland College&#x27;s competency-based education systems.</div>

<p><b>Assessment, sometimes called analyses and feedback, is at the heart of teaching and learning and involves the give and take between teacher and learner about what happened or should happen during the learning process; assessment focuses on learning, teaching, outcomes, competencies, skills or even the acquisition of knowledge. Assessment results are useful to both learner and teacher as they reflect on their next steps</b></p>

<p><b>Grades and grading, on the other hand, ar an evaluation rocess;<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>they<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>provide a framework for presenting evidence of educational achievement or accomplishment; grading represents an attempt to apply standardized measurement to levels of achievement in a course or program; in the education context, each grade is considered equivalent to one year of study.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Grades also serve as a communication device among educators and the people they serve. My review of the literature suggests that assessing students for the purpose of assigning levels of proficiency and ranking is not a teaching function<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>According to the literature, grading represents a conflict of interest between teacher and student.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>For these reasons, most sectors and many educational organizations separate the teaching and the grading functions; apprenticeship, international baccalaureate program, music and others are examples of the latter approach.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Most developed countries, except the US and Canada, have established qualification authorities to deal with the matter of communicating education results.</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Grading implies a purpose; Important to establish meaning and purpose of grades first</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Proposed principles:</b></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li3"><b>Grades reflect achievement on outcomes or competencies</b></li>
  <li class="li3"><b>Grades provide information for students and parents – or colleges and employers?</b></li>
  <li class="li3"><b>Reflect individual achievement not group effort</b></li>
  <li class="li3"><b>Grades are intended to motivate, indicate what is required to improve performance</b></li>
  <li class="li3"><b>Equity and effort are not part of a subject grades</b></li>
  <li class="li3"><b>Grades make sense only when paired with achievement.</b></li>
  <li class="li3"><b>Grading standards my differ on a competency depending on purpose or context.</b></li>
  <li class="li3"><b>Evaluation is criterion mus be relevant to the puurpose<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></li>
</ul>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Ranking involves measuring how one person stacks up against others of the same age, number of years of study, in other countries; ranking serves a number of functions in an educational system including accountability, gate-keeping, instructional diagnosis and monitoring of student achievement.</b></p>
<p><b>Evaluate</b></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li3"><b>form an idea about the amount, number or value</b></li>
  <li class="li3"><b>judge the value or condition in a careful and thoughtful way</b></li>
  <li class="li3"><b>Ratings at the competency level are thought to be more accurate representation of what one knows and can do</b></li>
</ul>
