<p>To Whom it May Concern:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Howard (Howie) Jamieson</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I am pleased to support the nomination of Howie Jamison for an Honourary Degree from the University of Prince Edward Island.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>While I am aware of his efforts in support of a single university, his leadership in student affairs at UPEI and his identification as a “comer” in his work with the PEI Government, I will focus my comments on the critical role he played in the shaping of Holland College.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>In 1976 the Government of Prince Edward Island decided to transfer responsibility for adult education to Holland College; the transfer included the Provincial. Vocational Institute, Prince County Vocational High School, Marine Training Institute, the Handcraft Training Centre and all educational upgrading – staff, facilities, labour relations, programming and all such support services.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was a substantial change in reporting lines, operating procedures and even philosophy. Howie’s; expertise, his knowledge of the education scene, his personal experience and skills were central to the transfer and redevelopment of a well-functioning organization.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Howard understood the task at hand and was trusted throughout the organization, He was open, honest, efficient, available and effective in his work.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In addition, he maintained strong linkages with the community and was respected for his personal capabilities and integrity.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In addition, he was aa great supporter of the University and an ambassador for the University in the Island community. An honourary degree to a recognee of your first graduation class would be a fitting way to mark a fiftieth anniversary.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>It is without any hesitation that I commend Howard Jamison as a worthy candidate for this award.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Donald Glendenning, C.M.</p>
<p>President emeritus</p>
<p>Holland College</p>
