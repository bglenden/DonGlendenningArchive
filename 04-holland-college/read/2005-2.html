<div class="reader-summary">Examining the skilled trades shortage, Don distinguishes between licensed and unlicensed skilled workers and questions whether licensing requirements are realistic. He observes that education systems may bias toward prestigious occupations while practical trades lack public advocates. He notes that Holland College at its founding addressed this question—whether provincial resources should support all training regardless of local employment. He proposes recognizing skilled workers&#x27; organizations for self-certification, long-term public information initiatives, equal achievement recognition for trades, clear responsibility assignment, and dedicated funding.</div>

<p>Dear Sir:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>So we have a looming if not actual shortage of skilled workers.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Or is it a shortage of licensed skilled workers?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There’s a difference.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Perhaps we need both.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>What’s the reason?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Is it opportunity to learn the necessary skills?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Is wage or salary levels?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Is it working conditions?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Is it the image of the occupations where the supply is short?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Is it the life style associated with the field?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Is it because so many businesses are small businesses?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Are the licensing requirements realistic and transparent?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Is it a bias in the education system towatds more prestigious occupations? Is it beause those who are skilled are lured away to greener pastures?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Is it because trtade training programs do not have public advocates?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is probably all of the above</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>How many skilled people does our economy need?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>At one time it was thought that four technicians were required for each engineer – and number of skilled workers was even higher?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The workplace has changed and so, I believe have the numbers.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In addition the field also includes technologists as well as technicians and many sillled occupations hae sub specialties.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It appears also that many people who are professionally trained work in roles below their capacity .<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Is it because their specialty is saturated or do they take such jobs in order to continue to live on PEI? <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>This space is too small to address all of the issues but let me make a few general comments.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Employers tell me that there is a shortage<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>generally and a great shortage in some occupations.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And yes, colleagues tell me that opportunities for training in skilled occupations are disappearing on college campuses across the country.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Courses are closed because they are expensive, numbers are low or employment opportunities are limited on PEI.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If this is ttrue, should the same logic not apply to other occupations such as lawyers, historians, and teachers?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That was an issue 35 years ago when Holland College was established.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The Board of the day decided that Holland college was for Islanders wherever they decided to go for employnent.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Some options to considert:</p>
<p>Encourage skilled workers to set up their own organizations and do their own certification and licensing.</p>
<p>Undertake a consistent and long term initiative to provide information about both needs and opportunities.</p>
<p>Recognize achievement in skilled areas in the same manner that we do with the professions.</p>
<p>Clearly identify who is responsible for developing and implementing a plan of action<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Earmark additional funds to the initiative.</p>
