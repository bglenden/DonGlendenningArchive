  03 Assessing Performance
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Don critiques competency-based education&#x27;s failure to develop rigorous performance assessment systems. Using his high school shop class experience (40% theory, 40% practical, 20% attitude), he argues attitudes are undervalued—they&#x27;re actually the most important employment factor. He rejects averaging theory and practical grades, comparing it to averaging someone&#x27;s comfort by averaging head-in-freezer and feet-in-oven temperatures. Don proposes performance criteria (Quality, Quantity, Problem-Solving, Leadership, Supervision) with contextual levels derived from real-life occupational standards. His conclusion emphasizes that performance assessment remains education&#x27;s uncharted territory despite its critical importance.</div>

<p><b>Assessing Performance</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>Much has been said about competency or outcome-based education.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is one of the major educational issues of our day; it also has its critics.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Many of the criticisms, I find, apply to a version of CBE that is quite different from mine.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Such versions usually suggest a rigid, narrow and mechanical approach.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They are limited to a restricted list of outcomes, or they fail to address the whole area of standards and assessment.</p>
<p>Criteria and approaches for determining competencies have been described and approaches to their identification are many and varied.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In fact, books have been written on the subject.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A major gap exists in the literature, however, related to the assessment of trainee performance.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Performance assessment remains largely uncharted and some would say “un-chartable” waters.</p>
<p>When I took “shop courses” as part of my high school program, I recall being graded on both theory and practical work.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The theory was a result of my tests and examinations throughout the year.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My practical mark was for the projects which I had completed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My final grade was based upon theory, practical and attitude.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The breakdown, as I recall, was 40% for theory, 40% for practical and 20% for attitude.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I’m told that, at least in some institutions, similar criteria are still in use.</p>
<p>It is difficult to defend the practice of averaging of school grades at any time, but there is no defense for averaging ratings for theory and practice I order to arrive at levels of performance.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Neither<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>can one, in good conscience, average ratings of a number of performance tasks.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Averaging theory and practice may be likened to determining<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>a person’s comfort level by averaging the temperature of a person with his head in a refrigerator and feet in an oven.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>On average, he is comfortable.</p>
<p>My recent reading suggests a major realignment of this weighting.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Attitudes are much more important to finding and holding employment than 20 per cent suggests.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In fact, it is the most important factor, bar none.</p>
<p>Existing student rating systems are school based; they are not fund in life.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That’s unfortunate.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We should be using the same system that students will encounter in real life.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>School based systems measure the acquisition of knowledge; real-life assessment measures the application of knowledge.</p>
<p>A rating scale should provide both criteria and levels.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Some possible performance criteria could include:</p>
<p>Quality ― the accuracy with which a person can consistently perform a task.</p>
<p>Quantity ―the speed with which a person is able to perform a task to an acceptable level of quality or the amount of work that a person can accomplish within a given time.</p>
<p>Problem Solving ― the ability to overcome unexpected circumstances in order to perform a task.</p>
<p>Leadership ―the ability to lead others in the performance of a task.</p>
<p>Supervision ― the ability to consistently perform a task at an acceptable level of speed and accuracy without (or with a minimum of) supervision.</p>
<p>And there are others.</p>
<p>These are criteria; how do we establish levels?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There are at least 3 easily-identified standards to be considered for occupational training.</p>
<p>A level of performance for which an employer, customer or client would not pay.</p>
<p>A level of performance which employers or colleagues accept as competent.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Performance at this level may be considered as a “benchmark” expected of any qualified and experienced person working in an occupation or field.</p>
<p>A level of performance which is reflected in the ability to lead, coach or supervise others.</p>
<p>The critical task is to be construct a rating scale that takes into account both criteria and levels in the context of an occupation.</p>
<p>How, you ask, does one take into account the information or knowledge intrinsic to the performance of a task?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The acquisition of knowledge in an occupation should increase one’s level of performance (or else why is it important?).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Knowledge, itself, is neither a criteria or a level, although it may be a factor in reaching an acceptable level.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Knowledge must be factored in ― it should not be ignored but it is not a performance criteria.</p>
<p>Rating scales and benchmarks are seldom, if ever, absolute; they are contextual and that context is income-generating employment.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Performance at a task cannot be scientifically measured but it can be rated.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>An Instructor/Learning Manager is a mediator in the rating process ― interpreting the achievements of a learner in the context of the occupation.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This is an added reason for requiring instructors to have relevant and recent work experience.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>At the same time, an instructor interprets the circumstances of the occupation to the learner.</p>
<p>The number of levels of ratings will depend to a large extent on individual preferences.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Traditionally, levels range from 0 to 100 or from A to F.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The ones which I encounter in the literature range from 4 to 8.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Six would be my preference.</p>
<p>These comments barely introduce the subject of performance assessment.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You can rest assured that you will be hearing<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>much more about it as time goes on.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
