  Learning partnership
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">(160-200 words):** This document is a PEI press release from November 2015 titled &quot;Learning as a Pillar to Prosperity,&quot; announcing a provincial learning partnership initiative. The document reformats and reprints an official government press release promoting education as central to economic and social development in Prince Edward Island. The initiative emphasizes collaborative approaches to learning across educational institutions and government bodies. While dated after Don&#x27;s primary professional period, it reflects the ongoing institutional and policy context in which Holland College operates. The partnership approach aligns with values Don likely championed—viewing education as transformative for individuals and communities. The document demonstrates how PEI continues to position education and institutions like Holland College as key to provincial prosperity and development.</div>

<p>PEI’s education system has been studied extensively over the last two decades, including the Fogarty Report (1993), the Task Force on Student Achievement (2005) and the PEI Education Governance Commission (2012). These groups consulted broadly and formulated a number of similar recommendations focused on fulfilling the potential of every learner. Some recommendations were implemented, while others have not been implemented. <i>www.gov.pe.ca/learning-partnership<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></i></p>
