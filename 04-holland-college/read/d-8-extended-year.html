  D 8  Extended year
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">This proposal establishes the Better Education Fund to support improvements in public education by making strategic grants. Don articulates his core educational philosophy: standards should be set with flexible time rather than fixed time with flexible standards. He references Holland College&#x27;s early secretarial program operating year-round, where students completed training between 16-20 months. The pilot proposes offering 20 students who received B or below grades in mathematics or communication a chance to earn an A through additional instruction and individualized learning plans. The proposal emphasizes accountability, cost-effectiveness, relevance, standards alignment, flexibility, and choice in education.</div>

<p><b>BETTER EDUCATION FUND</b></p>
<p><b>Purpose:	</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Background:	</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Proposal:	</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>Education<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>is important</p>
<p>Key to a good life</p>
<p>Schools need our support</p>
<p>Well being of our community</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Economic survival</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Difficult for schools to keep up</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Equipment, books, resource materials, technology,</p>
<p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Students arrive hungry</p>
<p>Still drop out before high school completion</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Roles people play</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>All need help at some point</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Schools operate for a set number of days each year and students are encouraged to learn as much as they can in the time available.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In the world they are about to enter, standards are set with time being somewhat flexible. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Can you imagine a patient being turfed out of a hospital because the standard recovery time was exceeded?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Or having your car returned with only three of the four brake pads replaced because the mechanic had to move on to another vehicle?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Or the cladding being left off your new home because the builder miscalculated the time required to complete the job?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Of course not.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>So why do we accept it from our school system?</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>In the early days of Holland College, the Secretarial Arts we operated on a year-round basis taking in 20 or so new students every month or two.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Students completed the program and entered the work force on their own schedule; Time in the program varied from 16 to 20 months to gain a work entry profile.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>An “A” was within reach of most students if they put in the time and effort.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I believe that most students could raise their grades by at least one level if given the opportunity.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Why not offer students making less than an A, additional days of instruction so that they can raise their grades?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The cost would be minimal but the benefits would be considerable. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>CFPEI proposes to support a pilot a pilot project this summer offering<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>20 students, who received a B or less in communication skills or mathematics, an opportunity to try for an A.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>the pilot is not simply re-offering existing courses.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We propose, instead students be identified, the gap between their<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>current grade and the desired A be defined, a learning plan for each student be developed and instructional support provided.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As soon as a student meets the requirement for an A, he or she would be given the credit and would drop out of the program. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>It is unlikely that innovations such as this will only occur through external<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>interventions.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The Foundation has decided, therefore, to seek funds in support of this and other such initiatives. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>This is an invitation to support this initiative through a contribution to the Better Education Fund at the community Foundation.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Little progress in raising standards is likely until these conflicting views are reconciled; it is time to align the content and measurement of education with community based standards.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Dialogue needs to begin soon; external interventions may help to launch the dialogue.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Education is under considerable scrutiny and pressure to reform. Some of the criticism is valid; some is not.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Provincial governments have responded in a number of ways including:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li7"> restructuring school boards<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li7">lengthening the school day<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li7">encouraging charter schools<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li7">increasing teacher qualifications,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li7">specifying curriculum outcomes,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li7">providing teacher aides<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li7">adding computers.</li>
  <li class="li7">closing small schools<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li7">adding new courses</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p>These changes should help but changes in the delivery model are also needed; an<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>external change agent could stimulate desired changes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Stimulus money will be required.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>PROPOSAL</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>To establish a fund for from which grants will be made for the purpose of stimulating, encouraging and supporting improvements in public education.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>FOCUS<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>This proposal focuses on the following areas for educational improvement:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li7"><b>Accountability</b> in education is widely dispersed among teachers, principals, School Board staff and the Department of Education. This may result in good teaching being inadequately recognized and rewarded, and poor teaching being condoned.</li>
</ul>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li7"><b>Costs</b> continue to rise. The delivery model allows little opportunity and few rewards for containing or reducing costs.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
</ul>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li7"><b>Relevance</b> of some programming to later life is improving but still a challenge and is often sacrificed to the requirements of postsecondary institutions.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
</ul>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li7"><b>Standards</b> within the system bear little relationship to those encountered in life outside the education system; alternatives should be explored.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
</ul>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li7"><b>Flexibility</b> has been lost to a system of rigid class schedules, a mammoth school transportation systems, negotiated teacher-student ratios, regulated school days and school years, and prescribed course outlines and school texts.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
</ul>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li7"><b>Choice</b> is limited in a one-size fits all system where, to a large degree, students must go to the nearest school, use prescribed texts, take a program designed to meet university entrance requirements, be served by teachers not of their choosing, be managed by rigid time schedules and experience little individualization of content or approach.</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>CONCEPT:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>With the Better Education Fund in place, CFPEI will be in a position to provide leadership in the change process through the making of grants consistent with the concept outlined above.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The ability to award grants will allow CFPEI to become a proponent of change rather than simply a supporte.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>GRANTING GUIDELINES<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li7">Requests for proposals will be issued.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li7">Grants are intended to address system issues not those of a particular student or group of students.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li7">Applicants are expected to show how the results of the project will be incorporated into the ongoing operation of their school or the system at large.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li7">Grants will not be made for ongoing operating expenses<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li7">Grants will not be made to remove a deficit<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li7"> The decision to fund or not fund a project rests with the Foundation<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li7">Proposals may be submitted to external appraisers for review and comment<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
