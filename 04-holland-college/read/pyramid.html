  Pyramid
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Don compares two curriculum models using metaphor of an inverted pyramid. He reflects on early carpentry work at Chatham Air Base (summer 1948) where employees learned through immediate immersion in real tasks, progressing from simple to complex skills. Holland College adopted this &quot;spiral curriculum&quot; approach—students begin with field-specific interest courses rather than foundational prerequisites. This inverted model capitalizes on learner interests, reduces first-year dropout rates, equips early departures with employable skills, and reflects actual work-world experience. Don contrasts this with traditional approach of loading first-year with general subjects (mathematics, physics, chemistry, communications). He argues the inverted pyramid better suits older workers who gained work experience before formal education and took courses opportunistically throughout their careers.</div>

<p><b>Inverting the Pyramid</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>During the summer of 1948, I found work as a carpenter with a company building houses at the Chatham Air Base.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I appeared at the gate about 7:30 one morning looking for work; by 8:00 o’clock I was assigned to a crew framing a new house.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A couple of days later, I was cutting rafters and shortly thereafter the foreman assigned me to fitting trim around windows and doors.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Forty years later at Holland College, we designed programs with that employment practice in mind, that is, we introduced students to their field of study in the same manner that a new employee was introduced to the real work situation. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Ours was a spiral curriculum with learners moving from simple to complex skills just as one would in the work situation.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Even as students moved through their program, they recycled back through earlier skills as their interests and performance both required and allowed.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>We also used this approach also to bring into the instructional mix both required and desirable skills and knowledge from science, mathematics and communication.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Instruction and content were coordinated with skills being learned in the field of interest.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>This approach tended to build on the interests that brought a learner to the College in the first place.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>An added advantage was the fact that, should a student decide at any point to discontinue training, he or she could do so with having already gained some basic employability skills.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The inverted<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>pyramid:</p>
<p>Capitalizes on the student’s interest</p>
<p>Allows students to enroll in some of their interest courses and would probably reduce the first year drop out rate.</p>
<p>Provides students who drop out early with some employment skills</p>
<p>Reflects real life experience...</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The reverse is to “load the first year with foundation courses - mathematics, physics, chemistry and communications.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The theory behind this approach, apparently, is that having learned the “general rules”, the student is in a better position to understand the specifics.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This emphasizes the view that learning proceeds from the general to the specific; based on my experience, that is not the case.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Is one better than the other?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That depends.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>For older workers, the inverted pyramid reflects their actual career path.<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>They entered the workforce with no or a limited amount of post secondary education, they picked up courses that were available as interest and time allowed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Frequently such courses were work related.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Later in life, they took additional courses to broaden their education, to fill in some gaps or to obtain a diploma or degree. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
