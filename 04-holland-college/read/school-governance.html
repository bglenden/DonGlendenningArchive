  School Governance
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Reflective essay by Don on organizational governance, drawing from a university assignment decades earlier to read Kant and develop an organization chart for a small university. Don notes he later used this model as basis for organizing Holland College. Reflects on how governance principles from Dr. Gibson&#x27;s class still apply to questions about PEI&#x27;s public education system organization. Discusses governance models at various Canadian institutions (NBIT, NSIT, SAIT) and their influence on Holland College&#x27;s founding. Key anecdote revealing Don&#x27;s intellectual foundations for Holland College&#x27;s institutional design.</div>

<p><b>The assignment was a simple one “Read Kant and develop an organization chart for a small university”. I did as instructed, presented and defended my model, received my credit.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Ten years later I dusted off my paper and used my proposal as the basis for organizing Holland College.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Thanks Dr. Gibson.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In recent weeks, I’ve been musing about the organization of the PEI our system of public education.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>From what I’ve learned about our system and remember of that long-ago class, Dr. Gibson wouldn’t be very happy. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Dr. Gibson would likely read the Philosophy of Education; we all should do that.<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>He’d also probably think it reflects a narrow view of education almost as though the writer does not know the difference between education and instruction (schooling). <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He’d stress the nd for underlying principles, likely say the paper was too wordy, lacked clarity and want it rewritten;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>If Gibson were alive today, he would be 21</b><b><sup>st</sup></b><b> century documents; instead of Kant, he may well assign UNESCO, OECD and UNICEF document instead of Kant, as the basis on<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>which to<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>design a modern university; no doubt he woul consider the issue of professional autonomy and accountability<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
