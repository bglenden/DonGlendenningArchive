</div>

<div class="reader-summary">An analysis of prospects for education improvement in PEI, concluding chances are &quot;slim&quot; based on several observations: limited autonomy in school boards, hesitancy shown by adding &quot;Lifelong Learning&quot; terminology, youth-focused programming missing dynamics of education, lack of transparency in departmental structure, and absence of unifying beliefs or goals. Don suggests possible interventions: visiting Melrose, Massachusetts to examine educational practices, piloting competency-based education across the island, establishing a PEI Education Association, and separating professional from administrative/political functions.</div>

<p>Who checks quality of education?</p>
<p>Dear Editor:</p>
<p>Chances of change in education</p>
<p>Spending too much time thinking about what’s wrong</p>
<p>Need to propose action</p>
<p>Havent jeard anyone say they want to improve education</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Go into seclusion for a few days and produce a five page paper on education for PEI</p>
<p>Take a car load of people<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>to Melrose, Mass to examin what they ar doing</p>
<p>Perhaps stop on new Hampshire</p>
<p>Run a pilot math<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>CBE across Island to include PS&lt; YP and hc.</p>
<p>Establish/support a PEI Educ association</p>
<p>Recognize<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>burt separate the admin.political from professional</p>
<p>Put ,ssomeone in charge that doesn’t change when government changes.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I was asked recently about the chances of improvement in public education. Based on the observations below, the chance of significant improvement is slim:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li1">The re-establishment of school boards is a positive move; the key to improvement will be reflected in the level of autonomy granted to boards and schools. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li1">Adding Lifelong Learning or Early Childhood Development<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>to the Department title suggests a hesitancy to tackle the education issue.</li>
  <li class="li1">Delivering programs to youth misses the dynamics of the education process. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
</ul>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li1">A few days go, I sat with a small group of Islanders when a fairly routine matter arose that we thought should be discussed with officials in the Department; we did not know who to talk with; transparency remains to be dealt with.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li1">The department lacks a unifying set of beliefs, principle and goals and has yet to tackle the matter of identifying and describing what it is trying to do.</li>
  <li class="li1">Human/social capital</li>
  <li class="li1">We know how to do math better; the task force could be a lever to improvement.</li>
</ul>
<p>The school machine is still chugging along; not sure yet if it will embrace change.</p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
<p><br></p>
