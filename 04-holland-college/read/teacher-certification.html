  Teacher Certification
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">(158 words):** Don separates teacher education from certification, proposing certification verify demonstrated teaching skills, not mere credentials or subject knowledge. He catalogs twelve essential teacher competencies: environment creation, student evaluation, learner diagnosis, individual planning, resource selection, stakeholder communication, professional modeling, and others. Certification should confirm satisfactory subject knowledge, teaching skills, and learning-supportive characteristics. Drawing medical field analogies, Don advocates specialized certifications—teaching elementary differs from secondary; content specialization matters. He criticizes current systems based on subjects studied rather than teaching ability demonstrated. Don insists teaching skills are demonstrable, assessment requires judgment but isn&#x27;t rocket science, and teachers themselves can identify necessary competencies. This framework influenced Holland College&#x27;s professional development approach and Don&#x27;s persistent advocacy for merit-based rather than credential-based advancement.</div>

<p><b>People confuse teacher education and teacher certification.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Both are important but they are different; they are not two sides of the same coin. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Teacher education is a program of studies offered by universities Certification, on the other hand, is a process of<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>examination to ensure a person not only has met the minimum education requirements can demonstrate an acceptable level of but can demonstrate an acceptable level of teaching skills. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Certification focuses on the skills and infers the level of knowledge.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It’s not a bad combination.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That’s not to say that teachers lack teaching skills but it appears that no one checks them out.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As far as I can tell, teacher certification is based on subjects studied and not on what has been learned.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It’s time to update the certification system. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Learning results in a change in behaviour.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The act of teaching is the process of helping learners change behaviour.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A learner who has learned has skills, knowledge and attitudes different from before. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Teachers require a variety of skills.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My search did not turn up a readily available list so I created the following from the information that I found.</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Teachers must be able to:</b></p>
<p><b>Create a positive learning environment,</b></p>
<p><b>Evaluate student achievement.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b>Diagnose learning difficulties,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b>Develop individual learner plans,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b>Identify, select, modify or create instructional resources,</b></p>
<p><b>Communicate effectively with stakeholders,</b></p>
<p><b>Interact with the community,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b>Organize both individual and group learning activities,</b></p>
<p><b>Maintain records</b></p>
<p><b>Collaborate with others in meeting objectives</b></p>
<p><b>Model professional and ethical standards</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Certification implies that the certification body has gathered evidence, including observations, of the teacher in action and that the teacher being certified has demonstrated their teaching skills to the satisfaction of the certifying body,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Not only do they possess the required skills but the skills are at a<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>satisfactory level.</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Liken to a drivers license</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>In any field, there is a variety of specialtiesp; although the preparation may include many common or transferable elements, the certification is limited to a specialty.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>One is not just a journeyperson but a journey person in welding, construction or industrial mechanics.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Likewise in the medical field, one may specialize in surgery, oncology or obstetrics; certification is specific to a field.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>e a general practitioner,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>So to I believe in teaching. There are a range of specialties sometimes related to age, sometimes related to the subject taught or skills being learned and sometimes to learners with special needs.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A certification system, at least in my view, would limit the assignment of teachers to roles for which they are not adequately prepared.</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Certification assures the public, or should assure the public, that the holder has demonstrated<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>It seems to me, therefore, that the teacher certification process should assure the public that the holder has a satisfactory knowledge of the specialty being taught, the skills needed to teach, and the personal characteristics that encourage and support learning.</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Identifying the range of skills needed by teachers is not rocket science; just ask teachers what they do.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Teaching skills are demonstrable.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Assessment of the degree or proficiency si sensitive and includes judgment.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But just because it is difficult, does not mean that we should dismiss or ignore it.</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Responsibility for the above repairs rests clearly with the Department of Education and, I should point out, can be carried out at minimal cost and interference with the ongoing operation of the system.</b></p>
