<div class="reader-summary">A comparative analysis of challenge for credit policies across Canadian educational institutions including Holland College, UPEI, Colonel Grey High School, and provincial systems in Manitoba, British Columbia, and New Brunswick. The document excerpts policy language and institutional guidelines showing how various schools recognized prior learning and allowed students to bypass courses through demonstrated competency. Holland College&#x27;s involvement indicates Don&#x27;s direct knowledge of implementation at this institution where he served as founding president.</div>

<p>Challenge for Credit is an opportunity to recognize prior learning and to acknowledge this through the granting of a credit(s). The opportunity to challenge is consistent with a view of schooling that promotes and validates learning that takes place in a variety of circumstances including outside of the school.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p><span><b>Nova Scotia</b></span></p>
<p><span><b><i>Challenge for Credit</i></b></span><br>
The Department of Education and Culture recognizes that students may have already acquired the knowledge, skills and attitudes that an existing course seeks to develop. Challenge for credit provides a process for students to demonstrate that they have achieved learning outcomes as defined in the Public School Programs and the curriculum guide for a directly-related course.<br>
<br>
<i>Policy:</i><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li13">All students currently enrolled in a public school in Nova Scotia may challenge for credit.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li13">Challenge for credit is applicable only to designated Nova Scotia senior high school courses.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li13">Student may challenge for any number of credits, but no more than two credits at each grade level for a total of six will count towards a High School Graduation Diploma.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li13">Courses for which students have already received credit are not eligible for challenge for credit. Challenge for credit is not intended as a way to improve a course mark. Similarly, challenge for credit is not intended as a process by which a student can challenge a lower level course in the same subject at the same grade level as another course which the student has not completed successfully.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li13">Successful challenges for credit will be given a mark.</li>
