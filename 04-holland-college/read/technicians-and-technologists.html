  Technicians and Technologists
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">(152 words):** Don analyzes technician/technologist distinctions, rejecting institutional definitions based on program length. Using Bell&#x27;s laboratory evolution, he illustrates workplace progression: laborers/craftsmen provide basic assistance; technicians apply established technical knowledge within standard procedures; technologists extend technical boundaries; engineers originate concepts. Don emphasizes technicians require advanced science/mathematics knowledge and diagnostic abilities, not necessarily manual skill (varying by specialty). Technologists require broader knowledge spanning traditional engineering, business, and medical fields. Don critiques educational confusion regarding terminology, noting institutions award conflicting designations. He emphasizes occupational practice defines roles better than institutional credentials. Don&#x27;s framework influenced Holland College&#x27;s positioning of applied technology education grounded in workplace practice rather than institutional designation. His distinction clarifies that role definition flows from occupational requirements, not arbitrary institutional categories.</div>

<p><b>19 – Technicians and Technologists: A New Breed of Worker</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>There are two basic approaches to sorting people when talking about the work they do</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Educators tend to define qualifications based on the nature of the institution and length of study period.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A technician is a person who studied at a technical institute usually for two years, a technologist is a graduate of a three year program at an Institute of Technology, an engineer went to a university for at least four years and perhaps even longer.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Some institutions offered all three levels; other Institutes of technology may even have granted degrees.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Today it has become even more hazy.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The employment designation, technician or technologist is not heard very often in conversation; instead, we tend to describe the person by the piece of paper awarded.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>There is still some confusion as to the meaning of technical and vocational education as there is to the difference between a technician and a technologist. Some of the confusion, I believe, is a deliberate; some results from sloppy thinking.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Vocational education refers to studies undertaken for the purpose of finding or maintaining employment. It describes the purpose of the learner rather than the content learned. Vocational education may lead to employment at any level be it the skilled craftsman, technician, technologist or professional.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Technical education, on the other hand, is a field of study; it may be likened to a discipline. The field is technology - that is the study of applied science whether that be in traditional engineering, business or the medical field.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>In describing the growth of applied science, I often think of Alexander Graham Bell in working in his laboratory in Baddeck, Nova Scotia over 100 years ago. He designed and experimented with many applications of science from the hydrofoil to the telephone. He was a jack of all trades. Not only did he originate the idea but he went to his workshop and built the parts and products.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Soon he hired people to assist him, mostly labourers and craftsmen. Under his direction, they assisted in producing and assembling bits and pieces for his inventions. This allowed him to spend even more time with originating the ideas and preparing designs.</p>
<p>As he reached out and spent more time in the realm of conception and design, Bell added others to his team p people who could, under his direction, apply technical knowledge within the context of established procedures even though sometimes in novel situations.</p>
<p>This person, a technician, did not extend the boundaries of science but certainly, because of an advanced knowledge of science and mathematics, and certain diagnostic abilities, helped to insure the success of the endeavour.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>A technician's requirement for manual skill varies according to the particular nature of his work. In the production and servicing functions it may be high; in design or quality control it may be minimal. Even when a technician is concerned with the details of workshop or construction practice, it will usually be more important for him to have a fundamentally sound understanding of the underlying principles than to be expert in their execution.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>To return to the example, as Bell's activities generate more and more advanced experiments he adds again to the team by inserting a person between himself and the technician. The labourer, craftsman, technician, technologist, engineer and scientist, therefore, becomes a horizontally expanding project team.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Organizational structures sometimes confus technical expertise with supervisory responsibilities. While it is true that engineers, for example, often supervise technicians,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>this is an organizational characteristic and has nothing really to do with their ability to perform in their technical roles.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
