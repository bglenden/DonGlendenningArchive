  Outside the box today
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Don addresses three major challenges to educational reform. First, he advocates for continuous intake programs where students enter/exit based on achievement rather than fixed calendar periods, contrasting rigid time-based systems with outcome-based approaches like those at Holland College. He argues that staggered enrollment supports diverse learning rates and real-world employment patterns. Second, Don discusses Prior Learning Assessment (PLA), emphasizing it should be integrated into ongoing teaching rather than treated as separate gatekeeping. He warns against portfolio-heavy approaches that isolate PLA from the curriculum. Third, he proposes a &quot;Record of Achievement&quot; as an alternative to traditional transcripts—a comprehensive document recording significant skills, knowledge, and attitudes demonstrated throughout schooling, addressing employer expectations beyond university entrance requirements. He also outlines AQUA (Atlantic Provinces Qualification Authority) concept and includes detailed information on New Zealand&#x27;s national qualifications framework and the Canadian Restructured School Plan (CRSP) model.</div>

<p><b>Outside the Box Today</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Continuous Intake</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>Elsewhere in these my musings, I referred to the fact that education is driven by an out-dated administrative system where time on task is the constant and performance the variable.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The system focuses on groups not individuals and forces learners to begin and end studies, not based on learning progress but at the sound of a bell.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Teachers are required to fashion their teaching to fit available time rather than the system accommodating the needs of students. Learning theory collides with administrative practice and administration usually wins. The rigidity of the system, in my view, is a major deterrent to change.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The reverse should be the case.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Doctors keep you under care or in the hospital until you are better; teachers should keep you in their care until you perform at an acceptable level.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Elsewhere I identified a number of beliefs or principles followed in designing the Holland College approach to learning and teaching.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>One was the students should be able to enter or exit a program on their own time – that is, make time, not achievement, the variable.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Exiting on completion was not a problem,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>except that it made graduation exercises difficult to organize; staggered or continuous intake, however, was different.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Entry and exit times to programs, courses and units are prescribed by the “system’ as are the number of days or hours of instruction available to each learner for each subject studied, and grades are awarded based upon how much was learned in the time available.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Even colleges and universities, institutions with considerable control of their operation, operate on a time based system <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In addition to being at odds with real life, it paces instruction at a rate well below the rate of learning of many students; neither allows nor gives incentives to move through the system more quickly and results in some students listlessly waiting for the teacher and other members of the class to catch up.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Even after spending a life in the field, the logic of this approach learning still escapes me. Compare this with hospital treatment where the administrative system is designed to support the treatment of individual patients – if more days are needed to regain health, a hospital stay may be extended.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>This delivery model is at odds with practices in the work world where one finishes one job before moving to the next.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Many years ago during a visit to Newfoundland, I learned that on graduation day in the vocational system in that Province, roughly the third week of June, some 600- graduates of the secretarial program would enter the labour market and compete for jobs.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Not only should intake be staggered, I thought, but also a staggered exit also has advantages.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Theoretically, a new student should be able to enroll in a program as soon as a seat becomes available.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is a well known fact that no two students are at the same place in their studies at the same time in their life and, furthermore, students learn at different rates.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Even if, theoretically, two students were at exactly the same stating point, within days there would be major differences in their achievement levels on subjects being taught. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Individual entry and exit can and does work but this approach may require schools to operate on a different administrative model and requires teaching skills different from those used mostly in the traditional model.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Some instructors, I know, have great difficulty in applying an individualized approach.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In my experience, teachers with supervisory experience before entering teaching had fewer difficulties in adapting to a continuous intake model than teachers without such supervisory experience.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Although Holland College experimented with multiple and continuous intake, our record was spotty to say the least.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>One of our major problems was the many one and two-instructor programs.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>On reflection, however, I still believe in the concept and would give it more attention in the future.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>PLA Swamped by portfolios</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><i>Could PLA be defined simply as a “process used by learners and teachers to establish the range and level of previous learning”?</i></p>
<p><i></i><br></p>
<p><span></span>The PLA initiative is alive and well in Canada.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The recent conference in Ottawa was a bounding success.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I was impressed by the number, energy and commitment of delegates to broader and more effective implementation.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But I also left the gathering with some nagging concerns.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My concerns are shared, I know, by some educators with whom I have spoken both before and since the conference took place.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>First let me say that I wholeheartedly support PLA at all levels of education and I see great value in it as an integral part of the teaching/learning process.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Current literature emphasizes the use of PLA for the purpose of gaining (or granting) course or program credit; it can be used also in support of learning.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In other words, it can be a useful tool for those who teach as well as for those who sort.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Using it for gatekeeping, although useful, is too limited an application.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Part of the problem lies with the definition.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I’ve looked at several.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They focus on gate keeping with most of the gatekeepers being in the college system.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Perhaps PLA could be more simply defined as a “process used by learners and teachers to establish the range and level of previous learning”.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Let teachers, learners, schools, certification bodies and the private sector use the tool as they see fit.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>PLA is a continuing process</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>PLA needs to be integrated into the on-going teaching/learning process.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It should not be a thing apart, an add-on.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Learners should encounter it as they enter and work their way through an institution, program or course.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If we do not assess prior learning, how do we know the appropriateness of learning activities, how long it will take a person to learn it, or even whether or not the learner needs to engage in this learning activity, course or program at all?</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>In other words, instead of shaping the learner to fit into predetermined boxes called courses, can we shape courses to take advantage of the learner’s prior learning?</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>A conversation about PLA quickly turns into a discussion of portfolios.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A portfolio is useful but it is not the only tool.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The operative word in PLA is assessment.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A wide range of assessment techniques may apply; a portfolio is only one even though a very important and useful one.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The tools that can be applied to assessment generally are likely to have applicability to PLA as well.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Is a portfolio course necessary?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I’ve heard some horror stories.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The current emphasis on portfolio preparation, and the resulting courses in the subject, tends to make PLA something apart from ongoing education whereas PLA should be integrated into the teaching learning process.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If we do not integrate it, there is a danger of it being lost.</p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Is PLA age specific?</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>If PLA is a valuable tool in the education of adults who come back to college, why is it not so for younger adults also?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Even for widespread use in the K-12 school system?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And for all technical and vocational students?</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>CBE and OBE provide a natural home for PLA.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Couple them and we have a real winner; leave PLA out of CBE and is it really CBE?</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>As a first step in understanding, make a flow-chart of a learner’s route from school entrance to school exit.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Make a separate one showing the teacher’s role fro the point of receiving a class list to the completion of class records for each learner.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Study these “educational roadmaps” and identify the internention points where PLA would be useful.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I’m sure you will find a number.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I’m optimistic.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Full steam ahead.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Integrate the concept of PLA into both teaching and sorting.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Couple PLA with CBE and the next decade will see unprecedented innovation and improvement in the education of our citizens – both young and old.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>RECORD OF ACHIEVEMENT</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>There have been many calls for changes to our educational system and there have been a number of responses.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Included among these responses are the following:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Competency based education</p>
<p>Back to the basics</p>
<p>An increase in the number of courses required for high school graduation</p>
<p>Changes in requirements to enter College and University</p>
<p>Introduction of technology education, and</p>
<p>Greater access to computers</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>An obvious area for examination has been overlooked and that is the way we describe the achievement of students when they leave the education system.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The traditional Diploma, Certificate or Degree tells us nothing about the individual, what he is like, what he has accomplished, or his strengths and weaknesses.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A transcript helps a bit but only describes achievement in a very narrow set of life experiences.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Transcripts record one’s ability to study, recall, repeat, and explain events, phenomenon’s, and relationships in a discipline or one’s ability to perform selected skills.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This may have some value if one is entering further study but has limited value for other purposes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>School leaving documents have become instruments for screening people but I question their value in describing meaningful achievement.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The current system of describing educational achievement puts an emphasis on subject matter or content, and even that tells little about the nature and scope of study within the field.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It fails to report or describe many “ non-academic” achievements that may be important to institutions of higher education or potential employers.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is likely that the lack of an<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>adequate description of achievement deters or prevents individuals<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>from entering further education or employment where they could otherwise have succeeded.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>To replace a Degree, Diploma, Certificate or Transcript, I propose that each person on leaving school, college, or university, receive a Record of Achievement.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>A Record of Achievement is not “old wine in a new bottle” nor is it a rose by another name.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>it is a new drink or a new flower.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A Record of Achievement<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>is a concise and complete record of significant skills, knowledge, and attitudes exhibited or demonstrated or performance by an individual while in the education system.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Such a document would record achievement during his/her entire school life and would show growth (or change) during the education process.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>A Record of Achievement should include accomplishments in subjects or disciplines, describe ability to communicate (speak, write, listen), indicate the extent to which a person assumes responsibility for actions, skills of working with others, technological awareness, work habits, etc.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Records of Achievement should not limit themselves to simply identifying activities which a student engaged but rather should describe the strengths or weaknesses demonstrated through participation in those activities.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The development of a Record of Achievement of the kind describe above will take leadership and co-operation on the part of Educational policy makers.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The process of developing a Record of Achievement, should bring together all levels of education to establish both format and content.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This process, in itself, would be useful.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Ideally, a Record of Achievement would be more than that described in the above paragraphs.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It should include a continuing and life long record of educational achievement including that which relates to employment and educational growth through involvement in professional or community organizations.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The stumbling block to introducing Records of Achievement will likely lie with Colleges and Universities.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>While their views must be considered, their views should not predominate.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>After all, they only serve only 30% to 35% of young people who enter the public education system.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Employers, on the other hand, may welcome such a document.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My information is that immediate supervisors of new employees readily understand and adapt to Records of Achievement.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A different problem exists with the personal office of large corporations.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A record of achievement cannot be readily compared with customary documentation provided by applicants.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Personnel officers may call it information overload and the applicant may suffer.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The idea of a “Record of Achievement” is not a new one.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It has been proposed by many and implemented by a few for at least two decades.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In the spirit of partnerships between education and industry, perhaps it deserves another lo</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>The acquiring of an education and the certification of qualifications are two separate functions although the two are closely linked and frequently one is thought to be the other.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The fact that the delivery of both functions is, to a large degree, provided or driven by educational institutions often works to the individual’s disadvantage in terms of both education and certification.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>While separate certification bodies exist, they appear to place undue emphasis on results of study and too little emphasis on what has been learned outside the formal education system.</b></p>

<p><b>AQUA</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Concept</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>The idea behind this proposal is to establish an independent, private sector driven body with authority to assess and certify a person’s level of performance on a task or set of tasks such as found in an occupation or field.</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Characteristics</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>AQUA will:</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Be an independent organization with its own governing structure</b></p>
<p><b>Operate on a fee for service basis</b></p>
<p><b>Accept clients on direct application or by referral</b></p>
<p><b>Issue certificates based on demonstrated performance</b></p>
<p><b>On request, provide applicants with information on gaps to be filled to meet certification requirements.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b>Make extensive use of advisory/working panels.</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Benefits/Advantages</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>It is anticipated that the availability of AQUA will:</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Remove barriers to certification encountered in the current approach</b></p>
<p><b>Focus certification more clearly on performance</b></p>
<p><b>Encourage more self study</b></p>
<p><b>Allow educational providers to focus on the teaching function</b></p>
<p><b>Allow a certification body to focus on certification without regard to teaching.</b></p>
<p><b>Removes length of learning time as a component of certification</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Implementation Steps</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Undertake feasibility study</b></p>
<p><b>Prepare a business plan</b></p>
<p><b>Conduct a pilot of the model</b></p>

<p><b>86-NZQA</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>The development of a national qualifications framework in New Zealand arose from the fact that:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>· Some areas of learning had no nationally recognized qualifications;</p>
<p>· There was no obvious linkage between many of the qualifications and others · People were unclear where to find training to meet desired qualifications;</p>
<p>· Existing qualifications frequently did not recognize knowledge and skills already gained;</p>
<p>· Titles anctJDi1innology of certificates and diplomas have not been used consistently; and · Natinally rciognized certificates should help New Zealanders if they wish to work overseas.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The key principles of the National Qualifications Framework are:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>· It is desigsned to be easily understood and greatly simplifiesssssssssssssssssssssssss the range of career-related and academic qualifications that existed previously;</p>
<p>· It is designed to open pathways to earning. As learners progress they carry with them their previous learning which may be credited to a range of qualifications.</p>
<p>· It promotes lifelong learning. The primary focus is to meet the requirements of the learner. In doing so, no disticnction is drawn between general education and career-srelated learning.</p>
<p>· Assessment focuses on learner performance which is judged against published national standards. The use of clear standards in assessment allows flexibility in learning. As well as gaining recognition for formal learning, learners can be assessed on the job or through the recognition of pprior learning,;proces~</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The Framework t&amp;Cks~er Mrm J; the first six years of education, although it i;</p>
<p>possible for children to earn credits at a younger age.~the Ilrameworl&lt;: has eight levels.</p>
<p>A National Certificate will be used to recognize achievement at the first four levels. A nNational Diploma will recognize levels 5 to 7. Initial degrees will be placed at Level 7.</p>
<p>Level 8 is reserved for advanced degrees, diplomas and certificates.</p>

<p>The building blocks of the framework are Units of Learning. A Unit of Learning isw a set oflearning outcomes which a learner must master. A number of units may lead to a nationally recognized qualification. The same unit may apply to more than one q ualification. All units are not of the same length; some may be completed in a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p><b>CRSP</b></p>
<p>The CRSP model is:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>· Personalized in that it responds to and supports individual learners as they become increasingly self-motivated and independent learners. The model is built around non-gradedness, continuous progress and individualized instruction and tracks each student from the point at which they enter the program to the point at which they exit with a credit.</p>
<p>· competency based in that it draws content from real life rather that cut across traditional subject lines of academic disciplines. Competencies written as applications of knowledge, skills and attitudes judged necessary to function in adult life.</p>
<p>· computer based in that it makes use of technology to deliver and manage instruction. The use of technology also allows the learner and advisors to manipulate large numbers and quantities of resource materials with a focus on that which is most valuable to an individual learner.</p>
<p>· a flexible structure is needed to support large numbers of individual learners.</p>
<p>Characteristics of the model include a flexible school day and flexible school year, the multiple entry and exit of students, variable instructional and learning time to accommodate the view that more students can succeed if additional time is allowed.</p>
<p>· Based on site-based management allows planning and decision-making to occur at the school level so that day to day administration can be collegial and collaborative.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>While the writer recognizes his biases, CRSP is thought to be the only model which includes all components of a competency based system.</p>

<p>Although I retired from the college system in 1987, I was active as a consultant for a number of years thereafter. One of the most interesting assignments was a contract to design a competency based model for implementation at the secondary school level. It was both a stimulating and challenging assignment. The result was The Canadian Restructured School Plan, CRSP, which was designed to provide "an alternative to the existing lock-step, teacher centered, classroom based delivery system."</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The methodology included the establishment of National Project Steering Committee, an extensive literature review, convening of three focus groups, visits to innovative schools throughout Canada, a survey of 40 recognized Canadian educational leaders and considerable discussion within the committee and between committee members and professional colleagues.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The report identified a number of major shifts occurring in education including a shift:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>· From a system whereby students are admitted to school on an annuls or semiannual basis, to a more open system in which there is flexible entry and exit;</p>
<p>· From a rigid time-bound credit structure to flexible competency-based curriculum in which time is not held constant;</p>
<p>· From the lock-step graded structure to a non-graded continuous progress, individualized approach;</p>
<p>· From an instructional mode that is teacher -centered to one that is learner centered and teacher directed/assisted/managed;</p>
<p>· To an evaluation system which reports student progress in percentages or letter grades, to one which reports on the competencies mastered and the level of mastery reac</p>

<p>	DACUM has come a long way since the first analysis was undertaken in Ottawa in January of 1968.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>For people not familiar with the term, DACUM is an acronym for <span><b>D</b></span><b>esign </b><span><b>A</b></span><b> </b><span><b>C</b></span><b>urricul</b><span><b>um</b></span><b> </b>and is a widely accepted approach to identifying competencies being practiced or to be learned – and it is no longer limited to an analysis of traditional occupations. And it is a Canadian idea at that.</p>
<p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>DACUM is most widely used<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>as a rigorous, relevant, inexpensive and internally consistent approach<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>to identifying competencies in a field or occupation.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A major strength is the reliance on practitioners as the major source of information and a presentation of the competencies of a field on a single sheet..<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As a result, DACUM escapes the semantics of the academic.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is life based rather than research based and, therefore, is readily understood by people in the field since it reflects what they do and is stated in a language that the field understands.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The performance-based rating scale proposed by Adams is unique.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It includes all the required elements of a good rating scale ─ competencies, performance criteria, a scale, and benchmarks.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>While it does not have rubrics or exemplars, they can easily be prepared.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>On the other hand, it has benchmarks (industry-based ones) which are missing in most other assessment systems I’ve seen.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In my reading and discussion, I have not found an assessment system as complete.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>A DACUM analysis is a tremendous tool for identifying and planning learning resources.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>For each competency, one can identify the kind of human resource expertise required; facilities, equipment and supplies; appropriate learning activities; assessment techniques and strategies; and the best location for learning whether it be a classroom, laboratory, shop or actually in a real work situation. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The model provides recognition for prior learning, self assessment, instructor confirmatiob of achievements,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>a tool for career planning, a basis for learning plans, a place for recording learner progress and achievement, a foundation for certification and a planning tool for lifelong learning and an exit document.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Another component is that of program delivery and management.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The DACUM model also includes a simple yet comprehensive learning model and an equally straight forward model for the management of learning by teachers.<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>And it ensures that learners and teachers are “singing from the same hymnbook.”</p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>Even wider adoption of the DACUM model suffers from:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>the inclusion of “curriculum” as part of the acronym.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>DACUM is not a curriculum but is useful tool for planning a curriculum.</p>
<p>DACUM developed out of an adult educational upgrading program and was first widely applied to trade and technical programs.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This is not a source where traditional educators look for innovation.</p>
<p>The DACUM-based learning model redistributes much of the control of the process from the teacher to the learner.</p>
<p>The rating scale and process is much more demanding than that presently used in the school system. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Would replace the current emphasis in schools on what we know to one of what we can do with what we know.</p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>It is 40 years since the first DACUM analysis was undertaken.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Much has changed since then especially in the field of information technology; many of these changes make a DACUM-like model even more appropriate.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Its introduction into the school system would give schools the capability of increasing flexibility, relevance, learner managed learning, …<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is a shame not to tap into DACUM’s rich potential.</p>
