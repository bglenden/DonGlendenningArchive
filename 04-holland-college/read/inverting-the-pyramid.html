  Inverting the pyramid
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">A slightly revised version of Don&#x27;s inverted pyramid essay, adding context about his observations in England comparing US and UK educational structures. Don details his role during Canada&#x27;s 1960s technical and vocational expansion, describing how this led to critical decisions at Holland College. The refined version emphasizes that his analysis identified two variables—organization of knowledge versus learning experience—that don&#x27;t produce identical pyramids. He maintains the inverted pyramid advantages: leveraging student interests, reducing first-year dropout, and providing employment skills. The essay concludes educators should offer both approaches.</div>

<p><b>INVERTING THE PYRAMID	402</b><b></b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Years ago, while studying in England, I recall discussions about the education system in the UK versus that in the North America.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The consensus then, and that was many years ago, was that schooling in the USA provided a broad base that narrowed as<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>the student progressed through<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>first, second and third degrees.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>UK students, on the other hand, started with a narrower base that broadened with later studies.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Consensus at the time was that both were roughly equivalent by the time a PhD was granted.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I have no idea if this still holds or even if the debate continues but I found the discussions interesting.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>By the 1960’s, I was caught up in the rapid expansion of technical and vocational programs throughout Canada – an expansion led by substantial federal financial contributions to both new facilities and new programs.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They were exciting times during which I was frequently an observer and sometimes a participant in discussions about the appropriate mix and sequencing of general and specialized studies. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Then came Holland College and the issue was no longer simply an academic exercise.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Actual decisions had to be taken, and soon.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Would we follow the traditional pattern of the first year being foundation courses of math, English and science or was there an other option.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was not a question of whether general and specialized education should be taught but simply one of sequence.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My analysis suggested that there were at least two variables in play; one was the organization of knowledge and the other was the organizing of learning experience – and they do not result in identical pyramids.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The traditional approach to organizing studies, in a four year program for example, provides general education courses during year one - mathematics, science and communication courses.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A first year course in the subject that brought you to the institution in the first place, is relatively rare.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>During the second year, you may have one course or, if you are lucky, two in your field of interest.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Your last two years will likely see a preponderance of courses in your specialty.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The theory behind this approach, apparently, is that having learned the “basics”, the student is in a better position to understand the specifics- learning proceeds from the general to the specific.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I am intrigued with the opposite view; that is, that learning proceeds from the specific to the general.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It seemed to me, at least in terms of career programs, that one should build on the experience, interest and incentives that brought the person to the college in the first place,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>then broaden the field of study as the learner progresses.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Should a learner discontinue formal studies, he or she is more likely to have some employment skills.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The learning perspective also results in a pyramid but a somewhat different one.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Using the library, it may be likened to how a learner finds the book of interest.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When I visit a library, I usually have a key word in mind – the name of an author, a field i.e. Travel or biography or even a subject ier composting bins.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My objective is to find the appropriate reference as quickly as possible.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Yes, I admit, sometimes I go to brows a section but that is not my custom.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Traditional thinking is that students entering post secondary institutions should concentrate on general education courses first.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Typically, a student is lucky if the first year includes any study in the field he or she came to study.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>More likely, the student takes required courses in English, Mathematics, Science, History; with luck, there will be one elective and with better luck, that course could be in a field of choice.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The traditional learner’s pyramid would look something like this:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>My view is that learners can benefit from starting with specific tasks and as one and aggregating and generalizing on them.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Is one better than the other?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That depends upon the learner.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Based on my experience, however, either option should be available.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>For many adult or mature students, the inverted pyramid reflects their career path.<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>They entered the workforce with no or a limited amount of post secondary education, the picked up courses that were available or of interest as time allowed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Frequently such courses were work related.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Later in life, they took additional courses to broaden their education, to fill in some gaps or to obtain a diploma or degree.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Some advantages of the inverted pyramid include:</p>
<p>Capitalizing on the student’s interest</p>
<p>Allowing students to enroll in some of their interest courses may reduce the first year drop out rate.</p>
<p>Students who drop out of a program will have likely gained some employment skills</p>
<p>I’ve seen no evidence that the traditional pyramid leads to a better prepared graduate.</p>
