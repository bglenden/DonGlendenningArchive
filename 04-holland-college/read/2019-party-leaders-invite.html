<p><b>Gentlemen:</b></p>
<p><b>An invitation</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>We are pleased to invite you, as leader of your Party, along with leaders of other official Parties, to a conversation on the matter of public education on Prince Edward Island.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We extend this invitation because of the importance of the subject and the key role played by the Provincial Government in bringing about change. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>The conversation, we suggest, should focus on a framework for organizing and managing educational services in the 21</b><b><sup>st</sup></b><b> century.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>While open to all suggestions, we are thinking of starting with a review of education functions or services and alternative approaches to organizing them.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We will also review suggestions for improving an education system emanating from the OECD, UNESCO and UNICEF. You may also be interested in a learning model developed in consultation with Island students, the results of a study of continuing education in Souris, and some exploratory work in mathematics education. Given the subject, it would seem appropriate, also, to also invite the Minister of Education.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>While you know me as Founding President of Holland College, my experience includes a teacher and principal in the public school system of New Brunswick, head of a teacher education program serving technical and vocational education for the Atlantic Provinces, a Training officer with the Federal Department of Labour, operator of my own consulting firm undertaking projects in Canada and abroad, and representing Canada at a couple of OECD meetings in Paris.</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>We know that you have full schedules and are happy to juggle dates and times until we find a time that best suits. In the meantime, however, let me suggest we meet from 3:30 – 5:00 pm on Wednesday, August 29 in the second floor Board Room of the Haviland Club, at 2 Haviland Street, Charlottetown.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>We look forward to your response and, hopefully, to a stimulating conversation.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Sincerely</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
