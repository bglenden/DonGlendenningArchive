<div class="reader-summary">This document outlines the Island Arts &amp; Heritage Sector Prosperity (IAHSP) initiative, a 2003-launched stabilization and capacity-building program supported by CFPEI with federal and provincial funding. The program involved two phases: initial participants (six organizations, 2004) and an outreach phase (four additional organizations, 2005). The review concluded the program provided critical organizational development, noting that external assessments, workplan development, training opportunities (governance, fiscal management, planning, marketing), networking, and strategic investments (equipment, technology) strengthened organizations. The &quot;Looking Forward&quot; section recommends continuing organizational assessment as funding criteria, establishing on-Island training programs (possibly through Holland College), creating annual training for arts managers and boards, developing industry cohesion (through a PEI Arts and Culture Sector Council), strengthening government relations on arts policy, and building arts-tourism linkages.</div>

<p><b>Letter of Interest</b></p>
<p>IAHSP Booster</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>1.	Background</b></p>
<p>In October, 2003, formal approval was given for The community Foundation of Prince Edward Island, with support from both the Federal and the Provincial governments launched a stabilization project on PEI; Fund raising from the provate secotr took place in early 2004 with the Program being formally launched in May 2004.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The first phase of applicants (six in total) were selected in August 2004, and in the spring 2005, applications were invited for additional arts and culture organizations to be included in a second phase (Outreach Phase) of the Program. Four organizations participated in the Outreach phase.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>An Interim Review focused on implementation questions and issues, and an end the end of program review was intended to focus on results and achievements, ‘lessons learned’; and next steps.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The participating organizations felt the IAHSP was an important and timely intervention, and while there were various implementation ‘glitches’ to be worked through, most felt their organization had benefited, and were stronger and more viable because of the Program.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The review concluded that<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>the IAHSP was an important and timely initiative for the arts and culture sector on PEI.</p>
<p>Organizations benefited in both developmental and practical ways.</p>
<p>The program was a vehicle that compelled them to focus their time, energy and resources on the more critical and practical elements of operating their respective organizations. These elements included: governance, fiscal management, organizational effectiveness, strategic planning, and marketing</p>
<p><b>The external assessment:</b> all participating organizations noted that this was a key step. The opportunity to have an objective, external, knowledgeable person take the organization through a process of examining its strengths, needs, and challenges was critical to facilitating the ‘mind shifts’ needed to see the organization and its possibilities in a different light.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><b>The development of the workplan and contract:</b> the workplan and the subsequent signing of the contract with the IAHSP Board provided an accountability tool that helped to keep the work agenda ‘on track’.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><b>The training opportunities:</b> training opportunities in such areas as; governance, fiscal management, planning, and marketing, all helped to change the ‘mind set’ of both Board members and staff.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><b>The networking opportunities:</b> joint training sessions and site visits to other centres provided networking opportunities with other arts and culture organizations that Board members and staff may not otherwise have had.</p>
<p><b>The strategic investments:</b> computer and software upgrades, front office upgrades, sound equipment, signage, etc, were valuable contributions and improvements to the operation of the participating organizations. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>The Looking Forward component of the final report concluded that future funding for the institutions sinvolved:</p>
<p>:<b>Continue to reinforce IAHSP operational principles:</b> Ensure that any future funding initiatives and/or proposals brought forward to funders by arts and culture organizations includes:</p>
<p>An organizational assessment/plan as to the organization’s longer term goals and objectives;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>A clear statement as to how the requested funding will contribute to the long term goals;</p>
<p>A formal contractual agreement with the funder; the funder should expect concrete measurable results, and the organization should be expected to measure and report on these results.</p>
<p><b>Continue a focus on capacity building with organizations:</b> Explore ways and mechanisms to continue to provide training and development options for board members, managers/administrators, and front office staff. Options might include:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Establish an on-Island training program for an arts and culture management program; e.g. a certificate program through Holland College. Perhaps as part of the criteria for receiving funding, require general managers of arts and culture organizations to enroll in and complete a series of management courses/programs designed to enhance their capacity to more effectively manage the business affairs of their respective organizations.</p>
<p>Establish a series of annual training and development programs for board members and staff of arts and culture organizations. These training programs could include such topics as governance, fiscal management, human resource planning, marketing, customer relations, etc)</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> A vehicle to provide leadership and focus to the provision of on-going training programs to the sector might be the newly formed PEI Arts and Culture Sector Council (also Holland College, UPEI or any other educational institution on PEI may be utilized as well).<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><b>Strengthen industry cohesion and collaboration:</b> Provide opportunities to foster and develop broader industry leadership and cohesion within the sector. Continue to create an environment where more interaction and collaboration can be facilitated between and among the organizations.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><b>Strengthen the working relationship with government:</b> industry leaders should explore with government the possibility of developing an arts and culture policy framework to guide future funding initiatives and activities within the sector.</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> A vehicle to provide leadership and focus to fostering industry collaboration and cohesion, and bridging government policy and industry needs, might be the existing Council of the Arts. If it were to assume/be asked to assume this mandate, it would require resources to take on this role.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><b>Strengthen the arts and culture - tourism linkage:</b> A more strategic economic development linkage between these two sectors could result in more positive gains for both over time. Greater efforts should be made to build collaboration and strategic planning between arts and culture and tourism. Perhaps explore the possibility of a high profile culture and heritage tourism proje</p>
