<p><br></p>
<p>Dear Sir:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I am pleased to provide a letter of support for the nomination of Dr. Brian Macmillan to the Order of Canada.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Dr. MacMillan has served education in a number of capacities including the public school system in PEI, Mount Allison University and currently as President of Holland College.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is in the latter position that I know him best.</p>
<p><span>Holland College is a pace setter </span>in the education community in that it is very focused on programs that respond to student needs and contribute to the life of the community. In recent years, and under MacMillan’s leadership, the College has been an initiator of programs in support of the arts and cultural life of both Charlottetown and the Province.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This initiative has come first in the form of new programming in partnership with the Confederation Centre of the Arts, and most recently in the form of the Florence Simmons Performing Arts Centre. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Under his leadership, the College generally has been a magnet for redevelopment of the eastern entrance to the capital city.</p>
<p>As for Brian himself, he is a person with strong family ties, well-honed personal skills and leadership capabilities.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>His interest in and concern for staff is<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>evident and the College has been recognized as a quality employer.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I know that he is active both nationally and internationally but do not know the details.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I have no hesitation in supporting this nomination.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Don Glendenning, C.M.</p>
