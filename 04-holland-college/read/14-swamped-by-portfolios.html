  14 Swamped by portfolios
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Don argues for integration of Prior Learning Assessment (PLA) into teaching and learning rather than as an isolated add-on. He criticizes over-emphasis on portfolio courses, advocates for broader assessment techniques, questions age-appropriateness limitations, and champions combining PLA with Competency-Based Education and Outcome-Based Education for educational innovation. Written with characteristic optimism about reforming education systems.</div>

<p><b>PLA Swamped by portfolios</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><i>Could PLA be defined simply as a “process used by learners and teachers to establish the range and level of previous learning”?</i></p>
<p><i></i><br></p>
<p><span></span>The PLA initiative is alive and well in Canada.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The recent conference in Ottawa was a bounding success.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I was impressed by the number, energy and commitment of delegates to broader and more effective implementation.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But I also left the gathering with some nagging concerns.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My concerns are shared, I know, by some educators with whom I have spoken both before and since the conference took place.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>First let me say that I wholeheartedly support PLA at all levels of education and I see great value in it as an integral part of the teaching/learning process.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Current literature emphasizes the use of PLA for the purpose of gaining (or granting) course or program credit; it can be used also in support of learning.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In other words, it can be a useful tool for those who teach as well as for those who sort.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Using it for gatekeeping, although useful, is too limited an application.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Part of the problem lies with the definition.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I’ve looked at several.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They focus on gate keeping with most of the gatekeepers being in the college system.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Perhaps PLA could be more simply defined as a “process used by learners and teachers to establish the range and level of previous learning”.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Let teachers, learners, schools, certification bodies and the private sector use the tool as they see fit.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>PLA is a continuing process</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>PLA needs to be integrated into the on-going teaching/learning process.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It should not be a thing apart, an add-on.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Learners should encounter it as they enter and work their way through an institution, program or course.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If we do not assess prior learning, how do we know the appropriateness of learning activities, how long it will take a person to learn it, or even whether or not the learner needs to engage in this learning activity, course or program at all?</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>In other words, instead of shaping the learner to fit into predetermined boxes called courses, can we shape courses to take advantage of the learner’s prior learning?</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>A conversation about PLA quickly turns into a discussion of portfolios.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A portfolio is useful but it is not the only tool.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The operative word in PLA is assessment.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A wide range of assessment techniques may apply; a portfolio is only one even though a very important and useful one.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The tools that can be applied to assessment generally are likely to have applicability to PLA as well.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Is a portfolio course necessary?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I’ve heard some horror stories.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The current emphasis on portfolio preparation, and the resulting courses in the subject, tends to make PLA something apart from ongoing education whereas PLA should be integrated into the teaching learning process.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If we do not integrate it, there is a danger of it being lost.</p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Is PLA age specific?</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>If PLA is a valuable tool in the education of adults who come back to college, why is it not so for younger adults also?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Even for widespread use in the K-12 school system?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And for all technical and vocational students?</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>CBE and OBE provide a natural home for PLA.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Couple them and we have a real winner; leave PLA out of CBE and is it really CBE?</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>As a first step in understanding, make a flow-chart of a learner’s route from school entrance to school exit.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Make a separate one showing the teacher’s role fro the point of receiving a class list to the completion of class records for each learner.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Study these “educational roadmaps” and identify the internention points where PLA would be useful.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I’m sure you will find a number.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I’m optimistic.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Full steam ahead.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Integrate the concept of PLA into both teaching and sorting.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Couple PLA with CBE and the next decade will see unprecedented innovation and improvement in the education of our citizens – both young and old.</p>
