  09 Finding the key to competency rating
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Article published in CVA Journal on competency-based education, proposing performance-based criteria for rating competency levels rather than traditional theory/practical breakdowns. Don draws on his high school shop course experience and argues for criteria including quality, quantity, problem-solving, leadership, and dependability. Reflects his influential thinking on competency-based education that shaped Holland College&#x27;s instructional model.</div>

<p><b>Finding the key to competency rating</b></p>

<p>A formula based on an employer’s criteria for doing the job works</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Much has been said about competency-based education.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Criteria for determining competencies have been described and models for undertaking competency analysis are in existence.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Little attention has been given, however, to the rating of competency levels.</p>
<p>When I took “shop courses” as part of my high school program, I recall being graded on both theory and practical work.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The theory was the result of my tests and examinations throughout the year.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My practical mark was based upon three factors: namely, quality, quantity and attitude.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The breakdown, as I recall, was 40 percent for quality, 40 percent for quantity and 20 percent for attitude.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The practical and theory grades were averaged to five a final course mark.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I’m told that, at least in some institutions, similar criteria are still in use.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Are they still valid for rating performance?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Let us look at some performance-based criteria.</p>
<p>Rating of performance must occur in some context.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Performance-based ratings measure the application of knowledge, not just the knowledge itself.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is preferable that the same criteria be used both in school and at work.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The system must allow individuals to progress and should, therefore, allow for increased levels of performance based on experience.</p>
<p>Quality: the accuracy with which a person can consistently perform a task.</p>
<p>Quantity: the speed with which a person is able to perform a<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>task to an acceptable level of quality.</p>
<p>Problem solving: the ability to overcome unexpected circumstances in order to perform a task.</p>
<p>Leadership: the ability to lead others in the performance of a skill or task.</p>
<p>Dependability: the ability to consistently perform a task at an acceptable level of speed and accuracy without (or a minimum of) supervision.</p>
<p>These are not the only ones.</p>
<p>How do you ask, does one take into account the information or knowledge instrinsic to the performance of a task?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The acquisition of knowledge in an occupation should increase one’s level of performance (or else why is it important?).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>level of knowledge about a task is neither a performance criteria or level itself, although it will be a factor in reaching higher levels of achievement.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It must be factored in ─ it cannot be ignored but it is not normally performance criteria.</p>
