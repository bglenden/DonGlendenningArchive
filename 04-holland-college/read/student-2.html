  Student (2)
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">(136 words):** Don articulates core learning philosophy: learning is active, individual, and lifelong. Each person determines what&#x27;s learned from encounters, though initial learning often differs from teacher intentions. Don acknowledges that unlearning established patterns—especially childhood learning—proves most difficult but remains essential and possible. Using a builder&#x27;s metaphor, Don illustrates education as constructing one&#x27;s life foundation: quality materials and techniques chosen early matter profoundly because the structure houses us permanently. Repairs prove difficult after construction. This metaphor encapsulates Don&#x27;s educational philosophy: students bear responsibility for their learning quality, teachers can only guide selection of materials and methods, and early educational choices have permanent consequences. The piece emphasizes individual agency, long-term perspective, and quality commitment—values central to his Holland College approach.</div>

<p>A STUDENT’S<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>RESPONSIBILITY IS TO LEARN</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Learning is something that we do; it is not something done to us.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We determine what we learn from each new encounter in life.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Granted that many times we do not learn what a teacher intended and even the wrong kind of learning is reinforced, nevertheless, as we mature we have a responsibility to sort out what is happening and take steps to learn that which will be most interesting or useful to us.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Blaming others for our unsuccessful learning has, or should have, its limits.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Learning new information and new skills is easy; even unlearning old information or skills is relatively easy.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is the unlearning of old ways of thinking and acting, however, that is the most difficult - and this is especially true of the things that we learn in childhood.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A psychology professor of mine taught that our characteristics are set by the time we start school.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And it is this learning that is difficult to change, although I should add, not impossible.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>In my teaching days, I likened learning to building our house.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There are many techniques and materials available to us.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We need to choose carefully which ones to use.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The story is told of a builder who decided to take a vacation.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Before doing so, he called his foreman and told him of his plans but asking him to continue with the latest house being planned.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The builder departed and construction began.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>In the absence of the builder, the foreman decided on some savings.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He reduced the size of the footings, used a lower quality concrete, put in less insulation, used lighter shingles, etc.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But the house got built.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>When the builder returned, he called his foreman.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He said, “My wife and I decided to close our business.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Life has been good to us and we want to do some other things in our remaining years.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Over the years, you have been both a good worker and a good friend.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As a thank you, this latest house is yours.”</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>As students, we are building our own houses.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They are houses we will live in for the rest of our lives.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Yes, they can be renovated but it is so much easier to put in quality materials as you build.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></p>
