  5 Governance- consolidated 2
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Extensive May 18, 2013 treatment of school governance reflecting Don&#x27;s long-standing interest dating to his influential role shaping Holland College&#x27;s unicameral governance model in 1969. Don defines governance as &quot;who makes what decisions, and in what manner.&quot; He identifies underlying confusions between education/schooling and credentials/qualifications. The paper extensively documents that research shows direct relationship between school autonomy and student performance (citing OECD PISA data). Don emphasizes teachers should serve as &quot;educational family doctors&quot; with accountability for learner outcomes. He proposes clear decision-making assignments: learners/parents select schools and programs, teachers make professional decisions for assigned learners, principals focus on instructional leadership, trustees/superintendents operate schools, Deputy Ministers ensure quality education for all Islanders. Includes detailed Albertan school board decision examples and PEI trustee responsibilities. Advocates for immediate changes: consolidate educational responsibilities, delegate administrative decisions, clarify principal roles, assign student decisions to teachers, establish independent qualification authority. Later &quot;Thoughts on School Governance&quot; section dated May 25, 2012 emphasizes governance model could remove change barriers when combined with professional freedom and accountability. Don notes government role should be leadership, planning, standards-setting, certification, funding, monitoring—not school operation.</div>

everybody from state legislators to

broad range of learning experiences <br />
that may occur at home, at
church, in the community at large, at school, through travel, in
<br />
sports and recreation, etc. It really is the result of all
one's formative experiences of which <br />
schooling is only a part.
If we can differentiate hospital and health care, surely we can do
the <br />
same for education and schooling. This view is reinforced
by the fact that many Departments of <br />
Education are responsible
for public schools only with adult and post secondary education in a
<br />
different one. Even further evidence of the school-centeredness
of Departments is the lack of <br />
initiatives focused on
encouraging and recognizing independent learning. </span>

<span lang="en-GB">	</span><span lang="en-GB">Q
	There is a similar confusion about credentials and qualifications.
Credentials, more specifically, <br />
degrees and diplomas, are
awarded by educational institutions and simply attest to the fact
<br />
that a person has completed a program of studies as required by
the institution determined by <br />
the institution. Qualifications,
on the other hand, address the issue of performance and attest <br />
to
what one can do with what one knows. Educators help people learn.
While performing their <br />
job, they need to diagnose and assess
performance for the purpose of improving instruction. <br />
Sorting
learners, on the other hand, is not an educational function although
uses many of the <br />
same techniques. Asking teachers to sort
places them in a conflict of interest situation; it is <br />
learning
that suffers. The issuance of qualifications requires a separate body

<span lang="en-GB">To understand better the
governance issue, I did a quick scan ofthe PEI School's Act and its
various <br />
regulations, as well as the teacher's collective
agreement; it left me confused. I was looking for an <br />
understanding
of the decisions that can be made by a teacher, a principal, a
trustee, or any other <br />
decision-maker, especially decisions
about learners that can be made without having to check with a
<br />
higher level of authority. I did not find an answer, although I
am sure it exists if I knew where to look. <br />
My conclusion,
although perhaps an unfair one, is that there are few, if any,
decisions that fall clearly to <br />
one position and one position
alone. Report card comments, I am told, must be vetted by the
principal. </span>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in"><b>Background</b></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">The Government of
Prince Edward Island has decided to change from two English school
Boards to one.  While I am sure that there are good reasons for the
change, such a change by itself will do little, if anything, to
improve the quality of education delivered to our youth.  On the
other hand, changing the model couldremove barriers to change,
increase the chances of change or even reward change makers.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">While not an expert
on governance, it is a subject in which the writer has considerable
interest and some experience.  In fact, it was a governance issue
that led the writer, in 1969. to accept an offer from PEI rather than
another jurisdiction.  Also, in 1969 the writer, as a member of the
College Planning Committee, was intimately involved in deciding on
the Governance model for Holland College and directly impacted by the
result - a unicameral Board of Governors.  That decision, I believe,
played a significant role in allowing Holland College to become the
institution it is today.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">Given the
considerable level of comment and concern about public education, the
decision by the Government of Prince Edward Island to establish a
single Board of school trustees for the Island, this paper is put
forth as an instrument to increase the level of public debate.  The
writer realizes that there is not a single proven model for all
situations, neither will PEI’s decision settle the matter forever;
the school system surely must realize that, whatever the decision, it
is a temporary one and prepare themselves for more changes to follow.
 The tensions created during a change process are healthy ones; all
we can hope is that changes lead to improvement and provide a
platform  for changes yet unforeseen.</p>

It is frequently described as an account-giving relationship between

justify them, and to suffer punishment in the case of eventual
misconduct&quot;.<u><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accountability#cite_note-4"><sup>[5]</sup></a></u>

Most
of the past decade’s education reforms were initiated at the state
or the school level, bypassing or ignoring the school board and
district office. Now reformers are zeroing in on this neglected
middle level of governance, hoping that some changes—perhaps a
redefinition of the role of school boards, closer teamwork between
board and superintendent, or experimentation with new governance
structures—will indirectly stimulate improved performance at the
school and classroom.</p>

Cibulka
(2000) concludes that &quot;public school educators may help to
reshape the institution by their willingness to experiment with new
institutional forms, but they are unlikely to preserve the ‘one
best system’ as we have known it.&quot; He notes that &quot;resistance
to change&quot; in old structures &quot;is likely to further weaken
the institution’s capacity to achieve its goals, and to maintain
its legitimacy and survival.&quot;</p>

and <u><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governance" name="Governance">governance</a></u>
with several meanings. It is often used synonymously with such

answerability, blameworthiness, <u><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_liability" name="Legal liability">liability</a></u>,

As
a term related to governance, accountability has been difficult to
define.<u><sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accountability#cite_note-2">[3]</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accountability#cite_note-3">[4]</a></sup></u>
It is frequently described as an account-giving relationship between
individuals, e.g. &quot;A is accountable to B when A is obliged to
inform B about A’s (past or future) actions and decisions, to
justify them, and to suffer punishment in the case of eventual
misconduct&quot;.<u><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accountability#cite_note-4"><sup>[5]</sup></a></u>
Accountability cannot exist without proper accounting practices; in

on School Governance</span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in"><b>Background</b></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">The Government of
Prince Edward Island has decided to change from two English school
Boards to one.  I’m of the view that the change by itself will do
not thing to improve the education of our choldrenWhile I am sure
that there are good reasons for the change but such a change by
itself will do little, if anything, to improve the education of our
youth.  On the other hand, making the change provides an opportunity
to rethink the delivery model and make some long overdue
improvements.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">The system of
delivery for educational services has remained virtually unchanged
for decades.  Yes, schools have grown in size, new subjects have been
added, small schools have disappeared, teachers have more formal
training and facilities are wonderful.  But, with a few exceptions,
the model is still teacher centered, the system allows little
opportunity for teacher creativity, we still deliver to groups,
defining success in terms of content, fail to integrate take into
account learning outside the system or learning which results from
independent study, and fails to take advantage of the benefits of 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">While I am not an
expert on school governance, it is an area of interest and I do have
some experience.  In fact, it may interest readers to know that one
of reasons why I chose PEI over another college in 1969 resulted, in
part, from my view   as to how a college should be organized.  I also
remember well the discussion among members of the College Planning
Committee as to the nature of governance for the proposed college. 
The decision was to go with a unicameral Board and the decision, I
believe, allow us to concentrate on educational matters rather than
in operating a bureaucracy.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">As background, let
me express some views about education:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">Education is much broader than
	schooling.  <span lang="en-US">Actually focused on school system
	rather than education, 
o definitions of education, education
	system.  although ostensibly about education, does not include univ,
	college, adult educ, home based learning.  Limited to public school
	system.  Still a need for discussion of the education system, other
	important parts that need to be reviewed also.</span></p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in"><span lang="en-US">Learning is
	an individual matter even though it may take place in a group
	setting.</span></p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in"><span lang="en-US">Delegate to
	the lowest level possible but hold each person accountable for
	results. Freedom and accountability</span></p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in"></p></li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">Schooling</p>
<ul>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">The Department has a major role
	to play in assuring that every Islander has access to a quality
	education, but actually running the school system should not be one
	of them.  The Department instead should exercise leadership, plan,
	set standards, certify teachers, fund, monitor, set policies</p></li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">Schooling</p>
<ul>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in"><span lang="en-US">The
	Department of Education is an organization, headed by the Minister. 
	It is not a partnership.  Taxpayers ay the Minister for his tie,
	energy and expertise.  The minister has a large number of employees.
	 Partnership is misleading.  Not defined, I contribute involuntarily
	to the cost of operation, my children are clients or consumers.  Use
	of partners obscures accountability </span>
	</p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in"><span lang="en-US">It is
	possible to deliver individualize programs – at least much more
	individualized than we have today</span></p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in"><span lang="en-US">Education
	staff are paid to deliver a quality education to each and every
	person who walsk in the door.  Employees are paid to provide
	leadership, only one accountable for performance is pasid emloyees. 
	This study is about the school system and not resposnicbilities of
	the home, the chuch or others.  A ploy to shuck responsibility.

	teachers.  Found responsibilities but that is not the same as

	of duties.  Doctors and lawyers do not have a list of duties because

						<b>Why
						Are Changes in School Governance Being Recommended?</b></p>
						<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
						Most
						of the past decade’s education reforms were initiated at the
						state or the school level, bypassing or ignoring the school
						board and district office. Now reformers are zeroing in on this
						neglected middle level of governance, hoping that some
						changes—perhaps a redefinition of the role of school boards,
						closer teamwork between board and superintendent, or
						experimentation with new governance structures—will
						indirectly stimulate improved performance at the school and
						classroom.</p>
						<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
						The
						latest round of debate about the most effective models for
						school governance was precipitated by the publication in
						November 1999 of Governing America’s Schools: Changing the
						Rules, a report issued by the National Commission on Governing
						America’s Schools and sponsored by the Education Commission
						of the States.</p>
						<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
						The
						commission’s report documents the variety of performance
						standards by which American schools are being judged.
						Especially problematic has been the issue of lagging
						performance among minority students and students in urban
						areas.</p>
						<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
						Although
						there is little quantitative evidence that governance
						structures affect student academic achievement, more people
						seem willing to experiment with altering those structures in
						the hope that the changes will stimulate educators and students
						to perform at a higher level.</p>
						<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
						As
						Kirst and Bulkley (2000) note, &quot;reformers will continue to
						use governance and organizational changes in an effort to
						improve the performance of education, even though these
						mechanisms may offer an indirect and uncertain strategy for
						improving classroom instruction.&quot;</p>
						<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
						<b>Who’s
						Accountable in the Governance System?</b></p>
						<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
						Much
						of the discussion of governance focuses on the sometimes rocky
						relationships among teachers, principals, superintendents, and
						school boards. The implication is that poor school performance
						won’t be adequately addressed until these groups work
						together as a team.</p>
						<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
						Some
						critics blame the system itself and call for systemic change,
						while others favor workarounds to the current system, such as
						vouchers, school-choice programs, and privatization. Moreover,
						states differ so widely in their educational governance
						structures that it is difficult to prescribe a
						one-size-fits-all solution. A brief list of modern-day
						governance interest groups includes mayors, unions, business
						leaders, politicians, and community leaders, in addition to
						teachers, principals, superintendents, and school boards
						(National Commission).</p>
						<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
						Superintendents,
						especially in urban districts, have taken more than their fair
						share of the blame for the weaknesses in current school
						governance systems. Firing the superintendent is usually the
						first step in addressing governance problems, but this response
						seems only to have contributed to a high turnover rate and &quot;has
						often hindered efforts to improve schools&quot; (Johnston
						2000).</p>
						<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
						School
						boards are the other traditional targets in the school
						governance blame game. Numerous observers have been critical of
						school boards and their role in public education, especially
						the way they interact with school superintendents (Carver 2000,
						Dawson and Quinn 2000, Edwards 2000, McAdams and Urbanski
						1999).</p>
						<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
						A
						report by the Educational Research Service and the New England
						School Development Council (Goodman and Zimmerman 2000) notes
						that &quot;too many state laws require or allow boards to
						engage in the operational detail of a school system,&quot; such
						as hiring staff and adopting textbooks. State laws should limit
						the board’s role to policymaking, assign day-to-day
						operations to the superintendent, and, most important, says the
						report, empower board and superintendent to function as a
						unified leadership team.</p>
						<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
						<b>What
						Did the ECS Commission Recommend?</b></p>
						<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
						Recognizing
						the political and administrative realities of school
						governance, the National Commission on Governing America’s
						Schools recommended, without preference, one of two forms of
						governance: &quot;(1) a system of publicly authorized, publicly
						funded and publicly operated schools, based on some of the more
						promising trends within the prevailing system of public
						education governance, and (2) a system of publicly authorized,
						publicly funded and independently operated schools, based on
						some of the more promising alternatives to the prevailing
						system of public education governance.&quot;</p>
						<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
						The
						first recommendation extends current governance structures to
						include a few experimental strategies; the second
						recommendation effectively argues for increased privatization
						of school governance.</p>
						<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
						Writing
						in Education Week, two commission members, Donald R. McAdams
						and Adam Urbanski (1999), provide different views on the issues
						raised by the report. McAdams argues that a system of
						independently operated schools—the second option in the
						commission’s report—would allow school boards to &quot;govern
						more and manage less.&quot; He believes that if schools were
						run by &quot;individual nonprofit and for-profit organizations,
						cooperatives, sole proprietorships, and the like,&quot; boards
						would be free of the need to focus on the details of how
						schools are run and instead could &quot;set standards, provide
						resources, and demand results.&quot;</p>
						<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
						Urbanski
						favors the first option—keeping schools publicly operated and
						improving current governance structures. He believes
						decentralized governance structures would allow changes at the
						classroom level, where &quot;faculty, staff, and parents in
						each community and at each school would have greater authority
						and capacity to tailor the teaching and learning methods to
						meet high standards as well as the unique needs of their
						students.&quot;</p>
						<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
						<b>What
						Other School Governance Models Have Been Proposed?</b></p>
						<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
						A
						few economically based strategies for changes in school
						governance have been proposed since the publication of the
						commission’s report. Wang and Walberg (1999) recommend a
						system of governance whereby states and local boards would
						create basic standards that schools could devise their own ways
						to meet.</p>
						<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
						Thereafter,
						the authors say, schools would be free from &quot;operational
						regulation or close supervision.&quot; Schools that failed to
						meet the standards would have a set of educational &quot;best
						practices&quot; imposed upon them. Continued failure to meet
						standards would call for a clean sweep of staff or complete
						school closure, &quot;in which case… students could be given
						scholarships to attend nearby public or private schools.&quot;
						Thus, all schools, public or private, would essentially become
						entrepreneurial enterprises. &quot;Let schools set their own
						goals, standards, curricula, and character,&quot; the authors
						suggest. &quot;Let competition for students decide which is
						best.&quot;</p>
						<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
						A
						strategy for school governance with a business mold has been
						made popular in the recent work of John Carver (2000), whose
						Policy Governance model assigns the school superintendent a
						role parallel to that of the corporate CEO. Carver says the
						role of the school board is &quot;to govern the system, rather
						than run it.&quot; He claims that school boards have
						traditionally micromanaged the educational process, something
						that would spell doom for any manager in a business setting.</p>
						<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
						A
						radical redesign of the function of school boards, Carver
						explains, would include (1) a focus on educational results
						rather than on the methods by which they were achieved, (2)
						newly defined relationships with the general public and
						parents, and (3) a commitment on the part of the board to speak
						with one voice rather than as a group of individuals with
						individual agendas.</p>
						<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
						Changing
						or improving the relationship between the superintendent and
						school board looms large in almost all proposals for different
						governance structures. Edwards (2000), a school board member in
						Illinois for many years, suggests a form of governance that
						&quot;takes the decision-making power out of the hands of the
						few (the board) and places it into the hands of many (parents,
						teachers, administrators, and community members).&quot; Edwards
						puts the locus of control at the building level. &quot;How
						absurd,&quot; Edwards notes, &quot;to perpetuate a system in
						which orders are handed down to educators from a board composed
						of people, who, by and large, are not educators.&quot;</p>
						<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
						<b>Have
						Any Changes Already Taken Place?</b></p>
						<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
						Dawson
						and Quinn (2000), partners in a leadership development
						consulting firm, put Carver’s Policy Governance model to the
						test in several districts in Colorado. In describing the
						experiences of their clients, the authors report that the
						school boards were better able to focus on policy issues and
						that superintendents were better able to carry out the
						day-to-day operations for which they were responsible.</p>
						<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
						Notable
						among recent developments in school governance has been the
						takeover of several districts by outside entities when schools
						fail to make adequate progress on their own. For a variety of
						reasons, these takeovers have occurred mostly in urban
						districts (Anderson and Lewis 1997).</p>
						<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
						Kirst
						and Bulkley (2000) describe the recent mayoral takeovers of
						several urban districts, including Chicago, Boston, Detroit,
						and Cleveland. Whether mayors can successfully become
						educational leaders remains an open question, and the effect of
						mayoral control on overall school performance will certainly be
						difficult to document.</p>
						<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
						Cibulka
						(2000) concludes that &quot;public school educators may help to
						reshape the institution by their willingness to experiment with
						new institutional forms, but they are unlikely to preserve the
						‘one best system’ as we have known it.&quot; He notes that
						&quot;resistance to change&quot; in old structures &quot;is
						likely to further weaken the institution’s capacity to
						achieve its goals, and to maintain its legitimacy and
						survival.&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
It
is exactly 18 years since I first became a governor at my local
primary school. Last month, I stood down after 10 years as chair.
Next month, I will attend my last full meeting of the governing body.
In that time, I have seen five governments come and go, read more
initiatives than I can remember, seen three children through the
school, worked with four headteachers and been through as many Ofsted
inspections.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
The
governing body I am leaving behind bears no resemblance to the one I
joined in 1992, when the school was cleverly run by a headteacher who
had a considerable degree of autonomy (even then) and who conspired
to let us know as little as possible about what was really going on.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
Governing
body meetings sometimes ran late into the night, but went nowhere, as
a slow war of attrition was waged between newer governors who wanted
information and change, and those who colluded with the head to keep
us in our place.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
We
were one of the first <u><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/schools" name="More from guardian.co.uk on Schools">schools</a></u>
to be inspected under the then new Ofsted regime and the result was
shocking, but, with hindsight, not surprising. Inspectors shone a
bright light into some murky corners and revealed a dysfunctional
institution, poorly led, in which many class teachers were
floundering and pupils failing.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
The
head departed, and we rather naively thought our problems were over.
They weren't. Over the next six years, the school haemorrhaged
parents, teachers and pupils. Our free school meals numbers doubled
to over 60%, we slumped to the bottom of the league tables and heads
came and went, but the parents and other governors who stuck by the
school became empowered. The &quot;big society&quot; has been around
a lot longer than some younger politicians realise.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
We
didn't need or want more freedom, just the terrific headteacher we
eventually found. With support from the community and local
authority, the school turned around. My belief in the power of
parents to effect change in this way is one reason why I, with
others, have now set up the Local Schools Network for people who want
to support their local schools rather than rush off and start new
ones.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
In
my time as a governor, the context in which schools operate has
changed dramatically. It has become fashionable to rubbish the overly
bureaucratic, centrally directed initiatives of the Blair/Brown
governments, but on balance they were right for schools like ours.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
New
buildings, extra resources and extended services were rightly matched
by a requirement for better <u><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/teaching" name="More from guardian.co.uk on Teaching">teaching</a></u>
and leadership, higher expectations, and more rigour, accountability
and transparency. Maybe only those of us who remember the late
eighties and early nineties fully appreciate what has been done.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
As
it happens, on the day I stepped down as chair, Michael Gove
abolished the self-evaluation form in favour of letting schools find
their own preferred method of self-evaluation. Ours had just been
completed, and was on the agenda for that night's meeting, during
which one new governor explained how much he had learned from it,
even before walking across the school's threshold for the first time.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
Of
course, even within a centrally prescribed system, a school's
self-evaluation is only as good as the head and senior team. The
effectiveness with which it is acted on, only as good as the
governing body's understanding of roles and responsibilities.
Nevertheless, in 2010, many governing bodies can take for granted
what we so desperately needed 18 years ago.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
I
think I can write the script for what will happen in schools where
more freedom is given, where light touch or non-existent inspection
is required, particularly if a good head or chair of governors is
replaced by a less competent one. Reading Stephanie Northen's piece,
opposite, only confirms my fears.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
Headteachers
often want more autonomy, and that is understandable. We would all
probably rather do our jobs without someone looking over our
shoulders. But the balance between freedom and accountability is a
delicate one. Giving heads more freedom, and making them less
accountable, is fine if they are good, but could have disastrous
consequences for the parents and pupils it is supposed to help if
they are not.</p>

<b>Alberta's
education system offers lesson in competition </b>

</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
Alberta
public schools (and it pains this Calgarian to say that Edmonton has
been in the lead) have created all sorts of special programs. 
</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
When
British Prime Minister David Cameron spoke to the Canadian
Parliament, he mentioned that Alberta schools routinely rank higher
than those of any other English-speaking jurisdiction in
international tests of educational competence. The fact is
interesting in itself, but the reason behind it is even more
interesting – that there is such a high degree of competition in
Alberta’s educational sector. Of course, a degree of educational
competition exists in other provinces, but Alberta has gone further
by combining all forms of competition present in Canada with other 
</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
The
first level of competition is that between public and Catholic
schools. Alberta has always funded both systems to the same degree,
so the competition between them is on a level playing field. Given
the prevalence of mixed marriages today, many parents can choose to
send their children to either type of school.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
Another
level of competition is provided by private schools, both religious
and secular. Depending on certain factors, private schools can
receive either 60 per cent or 70 per cent of the per pupil provincial
grant paid to the public and Catholic systems, while recovering the
rest of their costs from tuition. This subsidy brings private
education within the means of many Alberta families.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
Parents
deeply committed to some special educational approach can choose
private schools that receive no subsidy because they don’t teach
the Alberta curriculum, or the option of home schooling. These
parents are free to spend extraordinary amounts of money or time on
what they perceive to be their children’s future welfare.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
And
then there are the 13 public charter schools first authorized by
Ralph Klein’s government in 1994. These schools are run by the
parents who group together to found them. With full public funding,
they’re not allowed to charge extra tuition, but they’re free to
follow (non-religious) educational approaches that may not exist in
the public system.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
As
these options proliferated, Alberta’s public system fought back.
Public trustees don’t want to lose students because that creates
immense political headaches over what to do with underpopulated
schools. So public schools (and it pains this Calgarian to say that
Edmonton has been in the lead) have created all sorts of special
programs, sometimes even special schools, for the gifted and the
learning disabled, for aspiring athletes and artists, even for girls
and boys.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
Throw
French and bilingual schools into the mix, and there’s an
incredible menu from which parents can choose. Students are bused all
over town and into the countryside in pursuit of the option they and
their parents find to be the best for them. If the neighbourhood
public school is still the favourite option, that’s because the
public schools have had to improve their offerings under pressure
from all these forms of competition.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
What
has happened in Alberta education can be a model for other social
services, such as health care. Look at the big picture. There’s a
fully funded public system available to anyone who wants to use it,
but there are also other options – some partially supported with
public revenue, others completely private. Far from destroying the
public sector, competitive pressure has caused it to improve to the
point where it’s now among the best in the world.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
Those
parents willing to invest some of their time and money in education
become benefactors to those who prefer to use the public system,
because private investments lead indirectly to improvements in the
public sector. Our deteriorating health-care system could learn a lot
from the example of education in Alberta.</p>

<h1>About School Trustees</h1>
<h2>The Purpose of the Position of Trustees</h2>
<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
The
primary purpose of the school trustee is to represent the parents and
the needs of the school children in the area the board or district
represents. Trustees participate in the discussions and decisions of
the school boards. Federal and provincial legislation describe the
responsibilities of the school trustee as: 
</p>
<ol>
	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0in">
	To attend meetings of the school boards and exercise the powers and
	the duties of a trustee in good faith. 
	</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">
	To comply with the requirements of the regulations concerning
	conflict of interest. 
	</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
	To comply with all the requirements of the School Act, the
	Regulations and Minister's directives. 
	</p></li>
</ol>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Therefore, the trustee
is not only a decision-maker, acting in concert with the other
trustees on the Board, but is also an agent of the Minister of
Education to ensure the School Act, the Regulations and Minister's
directives are followed.</p>
<h2>Responsibilities of Trustees</h2>
<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
Section
49 of the School Act outlines the responsibilities of the school
boards. Ultimately, it is up to the school board to ensure fulfilment
of its responsibilities. These responsibilities are: 
</p>
<ol start="9">
	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0in">
	The provision of instruction in an educational program to all those
	enrolled and eligible. 
	</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">
	To provide for the management of staff and its staff development
	needs. 
	</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">
	To provide for and manage facilities and equipment. 
	</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">
	To provide transportation for students. 
	</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">
	To manage the financial affairs of the school board. 
	</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">
	To monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of schools. 
	</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">
	To ensure the development and approval of school improvement plans. 
	</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
	To encourage good relations among schools, parents and the
	community, and to promote awareness of the importance of education. 
	</p></li>
</ol>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Section 50 of the
School Act outlines areas in which a school board may develop
policies. They include providing educational programs and services,
the administration and management of staff, facilities and equipment,
as well as the financial affairs of the board, the suspension and
expulsion of students, student attendance, assessment of students,
conducting pilot or local programs, and finally, the management of
volunteer services.</p>
<h2>Requirements of a Trustee</h2>
<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
Trustees:

</p>
<ul>
	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0in">
	must be a Canadian citizen, 
	</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">
	must be a resident in the school unit for at least six months prior
	to the election day, and 
	</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
	cannot be an employee of any school board or the Department of
	Education. 
	</p></li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
French
Language School Board trustees must meet one of the following
qualifications: 
</p>
<ul>
	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0in">
	must be the parent of a student receiving French first language
	instruction on PEI, or 
	</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">
	must be eligible to have a child receive French first-language
	instruction, or 
	</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
	must be eligible to have a child receive French first-language
	instruction, if the candidate had a child. 
	</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Nomination</h2>
<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
To
be nominated as a candidate for school trustee, any 10 or more
persons, who also meet the requirements to be a trustee, as stated
above, may nominate a candidate for the zone in which the nominator
resides. The nomination is made by filing, with the zone returning
officer, a nomination paper in the form approved by the Chief
Electoral Officer, at any time between the beginning date of the
election campaign and 4:00 p.m. on nomination day.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
Nomination
day will be Friday, the seventeenth day before ordinary polling day.
Following nomination day, the Chief Electoral Officer determines the
eligibility of candidates. The names of all eligible candidates will
be published in provincial newspapers. Details regarding the
electoral zones and polling stations will also be published at that
time.</p>
<h2>Length of Terms</h2>
<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
School
trustees are elected for a four-year term. Where an election produces
fewer than the prescribed number of trustees of a school board,
Executive Council shall appoint, from those eligible to be
candidates, the additional members necessary to bring the number of
trustees to the total. The term of those appointed is also four years
or the amount of the term remaining, up to four years.</p>

<p align="center" style="margin-bottom: 0.14in"><span lang="en-US">Thoughts
on School Governance</span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in"><b>Background</b></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in"><i>Changes in
education are needed.  Change is not something to be undertaken every
few years; in the words of local business leader, the ability to
manage change is one of the important skills of modern society.  
Most businesses have had to reinvent themselves, sometimes more than
once, yet schools continue with a bit of tinkering and fine tuning.</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">The system of
delivery for educational services has remained virtually unchanged
for decades.  Yes, schools have grown in size, new subjects have been
added, small schools have disappeared, But the concept of placing
learners in the care of schools lfor several hours each day has not
changed – at least for the better.  We’be failed to talke
advantage of advances in technology and new approaches to teacvhing
and it is unlikely, therefore, that the changes that are needed will
be generated by people now in the system.  While I welcomed the
Minister’s announcement of aneducation study, in my view, it had
two strikes against it from day one.  Governance was too narrow a
focus to deal with the concerns being expressed to me and the
leadership of the study was internal.  Again, in my view, the focus
should have been on improving education; commissioner would soon have
found that the governance structure was one of the problems but
certainly not the only one.  It appears that the Commissioners
arrived at the same conclusion because their very first
recommendation is that the Minister review “…the philosophy of
education”.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">In the same vein, I
also agree with the recommendation for increased parent participation
in education matters, but it should be broadened to include
engagement of citizens generally, not just parents.  After all,
schools help people prepare for their various life roles; where
better to look for help than the people who fill those roles.   That
having been said, I am equally supportive of the view that any
changes to the system should include both greater freedom and
accountability for teachers.  Engagement is more than a token citizen
on selected committees; messy and all as it is, engagement is
democracy in action.it</p>

						<b>New
						Patterns of School Governance</b></p>
						<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
						<i>By
						Ron Renchler</i></p>
						<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
						School
						governance has long been a political football, as local, state,
						and federal stakeholders work—sometimes cooperatively and
						sometimes at odds—to establish or influence policy and then
						implement accountability measures to track the quality of
						schools in the United States.</p>
						<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
						Proponents
						of change have recently recommended a number of new
						approaches—and variations on old ones—to meet the complex
						challenge of improving public education through different forms
						of school governance. However, as with change in any
						organizational setting, resistance has been strong, and the
						public debate on the appropriateness of new models for school
						governance continues.</p>
						<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
						This
						Digest explains why public-school governance is the subject of
						increasing scrutiny, identifies who is held accountable for
						results in the current governance system, and describes several
						recent proposals for transforming governance structures.</p>
						<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
						<b>Why
						Are Changes in School Governance Being Recommended?</b></p>
						<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
						Most
						of the past decade’s education reforms were initiated at the
						state or the school level, bypassing or ignoring the school
						board and district office. Now reformers are zeroing in on this
						neglected middle level of governance, hoping that some
						changes—perhaps a redefinition of the role of school boards,
						closer teamwork between board and superintendent, or
						experimentation with new governance structures—will
						indirectly stimulate improved performance at the school and
						classroom.</p>
						<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
						The
						latest round of debate about the most effective models for
						school governance was precipitated by the publication in
						November 1999 of Governing America’s Schools: Changing the
						Rules, a report issued by the National Commission on Governing
						America’s Schools and sponsored by the Education Commission
						of the States.</p>
						<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
						The
						commission’s report documents the variety of performance
						standards by which American schools are being judged.
						Especially problematic has been the issue of lagging
						performance among minority students and students in urban
						areas.</p>
						<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
						Although
						there is little quantitative evidence that governance
						structures affect student academic achievement, more people
						seem willing to experiment with altering those structures in
						the hope that the changes will stimulate educators and students
						to perform at a higher level.</p>
						<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
						As
						Kirst and Bulkley (2000) note, &quot;reformers will continue to
						use governance and organizational changes in an effort to
						improve the performance of education, even though these
						mechanisms may offer an indirect and uncertain strategy for
						improving classroom instruction.&quot;</p>
						<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
						<b>Who’s
						Accountable in the Governance System?</b></p>
						<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
						Much
						of the discussion of governance focuses on the sometimes rocky
						relationships among teachers, principals, superintendents, and
						school boards. The implication is that poor school performance
						won’t be adequately addressed until these groups work
						together as a team.</p>
						<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
						Some
						critics blame the system itself and call for systemic change,
						while others favor workarounds to the current system, such as
						vouchers, school-choice programs, and privatization. Moreover,
						states differ so widely in their educational governance
						structures that it is difficult to prescribe a
						one-size-fits-all solution. A brief list of modern-day
						governance interest groups includes mayors, unions, business
						leaders, politicians, and community leaders, in addition to
						teachers, principals, superintendents, and school boards
						(National Commission).</p>
						<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
						Superintendents,
						especially in urban districts, have taken more than their fair
						share of the blame for the weaknesses in current school
						governance systems. Firing the superintendent is usually the
						first step in addressing governance problems, but this response
						seems only to have contributed to a high turnover rate and &quot;has
						often hindered efforts to improve schools&quot; (Johnston
						2000).</p>
						<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
						School
						boards are the other traditional targets in the school
						governance blame game. Numerous observers have been critical of
						school boards and their role in public education, especially
						the way they interact with school superintendents (Carver 2000,
						Dawson and Quinn 2000, Edwards 2000, McAdams and Urbanski
						1999).</p>
						<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
						A
						report by the Educational Research Service and the New England
						School Development Council (Goodman and Zimmerman 2000) notes
						that &quot;too many state laws require or allow boards to
						engage in the operational detail of a school system,&quot; such
						as hiring staff and adopting textbooks. State laws should limit
						the board’s role to policymaking, assign day-to-day
						operations to the superintendent, and, most important, says the
						report, empower board and superintendent to function as a
						unified leadership team.</p>
						<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
						<b>What
						Did the ECS Commission Recommend?</b></p>
						<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
						Recognizing
						the political and administrative realities of school
						governance, the National Commission on Governing America’s
						Schools recommended, without preference, one of two forms of
						governance: &quot;(1) a system of publicly authorized, publicly
						funded and publicly operated schools, based on some of the more
						promising trends within the prevailing system of public
						education governance, and (2) a system of publicly authorized,
						publicly funded and independently operated schools, based on
						some of the more promising alternatives to the prevailing
						system of public education governance.&quot;</p>
						<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
						The
						first recommendation extends current governance structures to
						include a few experimental strategies; the second
						recommendation effectively argues for increased privatization
						of school governance.</p>
						<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
						Writing
						in Education Week, two commission members, Donald R. McAdams
						and Adam Urbanski (1999), provide different views on the issues
						raised by the report. McAdams argues that a system of
						independently operated schools—the second option in the
						commission’s report—would allow school boards to &quot;govern
						more and manage less.&quot; He believes that if schools were
						run by &quot;individual nonprofit and for-profit organizations,
						cooperatives, sole proprietorships, and the like,&quot; boards
						would be free of the need to focus on the details of how
						schools are run and instead could &quot;set standards, provide
						resources, and demand results.&quot;</p>
						<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
						Urbanski
						favors the first option—keeping schools publicly operated and
						improving current governance structures. He believes
						decentralized governance structures would allow changes at the
						classroom level, where &quot;faculty, staff, and parents in
						each community and at each school would have greater authority
						and capacity to tailor the teaching and learning methods to
						meet high standards as well as the unique needs of their
						students.&quot;</p>
						<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
						<b>What
						Other School Governance Models Have Been Proposed?</b></p>
						<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
						A
						few economically based strategies for changes in school
						governance have been proposed since the publication of the
						commission’s report. Wang and Walberg (1999) recommend a
						system of governance whereby states and local boards would
						create basic standards that schools could devise their own ways
						to meet.</p>
						<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
						Thereafter,
						the authors say, schools would be free from &quot;operational
						regulation or close supervision.&quot; Schools that failed to
						meet the standards would have a set of educational &quot;best
						practices&quot; imposed upon them. Continued failure to meet
						standards would call for a clean sweep of staff or complete
						school closure, &quot;in which case… students could be given
						scholarships to attend nearby public or private schools.&quot;
						Thus, all schools, public or private, would essentially become
						entrepreneurial enterprises. &quot;Let schools set their own
						goals, standards, curricula, and character,&quot; the authors
						suggest. &quot;Let competition for students decide which is
						best.&quot;</p>
						<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
						A
						strategy for school governance with a business mold has been
						made popular in the recent work of John Carver (2000), whose
						Policy Governance model assigns the school superintendent a
						role parallel to that of the corporate CEO. Carver says the
						role of the school board is &quot;to govern the system, rather
						than run it.&quot; He claims that school boards have
						traditionally micromanaged the educational process, something
						that would spell doom for any manager in a business setting.</p>
						<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
						A
						radical redesign of the function of school boards, Carver
						explains, would include (1) a focus on educational results
						rather than on the methods by which they were achieved, (2)
						newly defined relationships with the general public and
						parents, and (3) a commitment on the part of the board to speak
						with one voice rather than as a group of individuals with
						individual agendas.</p>
						<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
						Changing
						or improving the relationship between the superintendent and
						school board looms large in almost all proposals for different
						governance structures. Edwards (2000), a school board member in
						Illinois for many years, suggests a form of governance that
						&quot;takes the decision-making power out of the hands of the
						few (the board) and places it into the hands of many (parents,
						teachers, administrators, and community members).&quot; Edwards
						puts the locus of control at the building level. &quot;How
						absurd,&quot; Edwards notes, &quot;to perpetuate a system in
						which orders are handed down to educators from a board composed
						of people, who, by and large, are not educators.&quot;</p>
						<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
						<b>Have
						Any Changes Already Taken Place?</b></p>
						<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
						Dawson
						and Quinn (2000), partners in a leadership development
						consulting firm, put Carver’s Policy Governance model to the
						test in several districts in Colorado. In describing the
						experiences of their clients, the authors report that the
						school boards were better able to focus on policy issues and
						that superintendents were better able to carry out the
						day-to-day operations for which they were responsible.</p>
						<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
						Notable
						among recent developments in school governance has been the
						takeover of several districts by outside entities when schools
						fail to make adequate progress on their own. For a variety of
						reasons, these takeovers have occurred mostly in urban
						districts (Anderson and Lewis 1997).</p>
						<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
						Kirst
						and Bulkley (2000) describe the recent mayoral takeovers of
						several urban districts, including Chicago, Boston, Detroit,
						and Cleveland. Whether mayors can successfully become
						educational leaders remains an open question, and the effect of
						mayoral control on overall school performance will certainly be
						difficult to document.</p>
						<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
						Cibulka
						(2000) concludes that &quot;public school educators may help to
						reshape the institution by their willingness to experiment with
						new institutional forms, but they are unlikely to preserve the
						‘one best system’ as we have known it.&quot; He notes that
						&quot;resistance to change&quot; in old structures &quot;is
						likely to further weaken the institution’s capacity to
						achieve its goals, and to maintain its legitimacy and
						survival.&quot;</p>

<h1>About School Trustees</h1>
<h2>The Purpose of the Position of Trustees</h2>
<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
The
primary purpose of the school trustee is to represent the parents and
the needs of the school children in the area the board or district
represents. Trustees participate in the discussions and decisions of
the school boards. Federal and provincial legislation describe the
responsibilities of the school trustee as: 
</p>
<ol start="4">
	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0in">
	To attend meetings of the school boards and exercise the powers and
	the duties of a trustee in good faith. 
	</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">
	To comply with the requirements of the regulations concerning
	conflict of interest. 
	</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
	To comply with all the requirements of the School Act, the
	Regulations and Minister's directives. 
	</p></li>
</ol>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Therefore, the trustee
is not only a decision-maker, acting in concert with the other
trustees on the Board, but is also an agent of the Minister of
Education to ensure the School Act, the Regulations and Minister's
directives are followed.</p>
<h2>Responsibilities of Trustees</h2>
<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
Section
49 of the School Act outlines the responsibilities of the school
boards. Ultimately, it is up to the school board to ensure fulfilment
of its responsibilities. These responsibilities are: 
</p>
<ol start="17">
	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0in">
	The provision of instruction in an educational program to all those
	enrolled and eligible. 
	</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">
	To provide for the management of staff and its staff development
	needs. 
	</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">
	To provide for and manage facilities and equipment. 
	</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">
	To provide transportation for students. 
	</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">
	To manage the financial affairs of the school board. 
	</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">
	To monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of schools. 
	</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">
	To ensure the development and approval of school improvement plans. 
	</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
	To encourage good relations among schools, parents and the
	community, and to promote awareness of the importance of education. 
	</p></li>
</ol>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Section 50 of the
School Act outlines areas in which a school board may develop
policies. They include providing educational programs and services,
the administration and management of staff, facilities and equipment,
as well as the financial affairs of the board, the suspension and
expulsion of students, student attendance, assessment of students,
conducting pilot or local programs, and finally, the management of
volunteer services.</p>
<h2>Requirements of a Trustee</h2>
<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
Trustees:

</p>
<ul>
	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0in">
	must be a Canadian citizen, 
	</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">
	must be a resident in the school unit for at least six months prior
	to the election day, and 
	</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
	cannot be an employee of any school board or the Department of
	Education. 
	</p></li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
French
Language School Board trustees must meet one of the following
qualifications: 
</p>
<ul>
	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0in">
	must be the parent of a student receiving French first language
	instruction on PEI, or 
	</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">
	must be eligible to have a child receive French first-language
	instruction, or 
	</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
	must be eligible to have a child receive French first-language
	instruction, if the candidate had a child. 
	</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Nomination</h2>
<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
To
be nominated as a candidate for school trustee, any 10 or more
persons, who also meet the requirements to be a trustee, as stated
above, may nominate a candidate for the zone in which the nominator
resides. The nomination is made by filing, with the zone returning
officer, a nomination paper in the form approved by the Chief
Electoral Officer, at any time between the beginning date of the
election campaign and 4:00 p.m. on nomination day.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
Nomination
day will be Friday, the seventeenth day before ordinary polling day.
Following nomination day, the Chief Electoral Officer determines the
eligibility of candidates. The names of all eligible candidates will
be published in provincial newspapers. Details regarding the
electoral zones and polling stations will also be published at that
time.</p>
<h2>Length of Terms</h2>
<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
School
trustees are elected for a four-year term. Where an election produces
fewer than the prescribed number of trustees of a school board,
Executive Council shall appoint, from those eligible to be
candidates, the additional members necessary to bring the number of
trustees to the total. The term of those appointed is also four years
or the amount of the term remaining, up to four years.</p>

The
way schools are run has changed dramatically, says Fiona Millar –
but some may suffer if they are given more freedom</p>

<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
It
is exactly 18 years since I first became a governor at my local
primary school. Last month, I stood down after 10 years as chair.
Next month, I will attend my last full meeting of the governing body.
In that time, I have seen five governments come and go, read more
initiatives than I can remember, seen three children through the
school, worked with four headteachers and been through as many Ofsted
inspections.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
The
governing body I am leaving behind bears no resemblance to the one I
joined in 1992, when the school was cleverly run by a headteacher who
had a considerable degree of autonomy (even then) and who conspired
to let us know as little as possible about what was really going on.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
Governing
body meetings sometimes ran late into the night, but went nowhere, as
a slow war of attrition was waged between newer governors who wanted
information and change, and those who colluded with the head to keep
us in our place.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
We
were one of the first <u><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/schools" name="More from guardian.co.uk on Schools">schools</a></u>
to be inspected under the then new Ofsted regime and the result was
shocking, but, with hindsight, not surprising. Inspectors shone a
bright light into some murky corners and revealed a dysfunctional
institution, poorly led, in which many class teachers were
floundering and pupils failing.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
The
head departed, and we rather naively thought our problems were over.
They weren't. Over the next six years, the school haemorrhaged
parents, teachers and pupils. Our free school meals numbers doubled
to over 60%, we slumped to the bottom of the league tables and heads
came and went, but the parents and other governors who stuck by the
school became empowered. The &quot;big society&quot; has been around
a lot longer than some younger politicians realise.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
We
didn't need or want more freedom, just the terrific headteacher we
eventually found. With support from the community and local
authority, the school turned around. My belief in the power of
parents to effect change in this way is one reason why I, with
others, have now set up the Local Schools Network for people who want
to support their local schools rather than rush off and start new
ones.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
In
my time as a governor, the context in which schools operate has
changed dramatically. It has become fashionable to rubbish the overly
bureaucratic, centrally directed initiatives of the Blair/Brown
governments, but on balance they were right for schools like ours.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
New
buildings, extra resources and extended services were rightly matched
by a requirement for better <u><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/teaching" name="More from guardian.co.uk on Teaching">teaching</a></u>
and leadership, higher expectations, and more rigour, accountability
and transparency. Maybe only those of us who remember the late
eighties and early nineties fully appreciate what has been done.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
As
it happens, on the day I stepped down as chair, Michael Gove
abolished the self-evaluation form in favour of letting schools find
their own preferred method of self-evaluation. Ours had just been
completed, and was on the agenda for that night's meeting, during
which one new governor explained how much he had learned from it,
even before walking across the school's threshold for the first time.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
Of
course, even within a centrally prescribed system, a school's
self-evaluation is only as good as the head and senior team. The
effectiveness with which it is acted on, only as good as the
governing body's understanding of roles and responsibilities.
Nevertheless, in 2010, many governing bodies can take for granted
what we so desperately needed 18 years ago.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
I
think I can write the script for what will happen in schools where
more freedom is given, where light touch or non-existent inspection
is required, particularly if a good head or chair of governors is
replaced by a less competent one. Reading Stephanie Northen's piece,
opposite, only confirms my fears.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
Headteachers
often want more autonomy, and that is understandable. We would all
probably rather do our jobs without someone looking over our
shoulders. But the balance between freedom and accountability is a
delicate one. Giving heads more freedom, and making them less
accountable, is fine if they are good, but could have disastrous
consequences for the parents and pupils it is supposed to help if
they are not.</p>

School Governance</b></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">The timing of this
Newsletter is influenced by a discussion about education a few days
ago with a small group of friends.  While the discussion was wide
ranging, one of the recurring themes is that educators lack both the
freedom to teach and accountability for teaching.  The resolution of
the issue, I believe, rests with the issue of governance. 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Education and
schooling; scool system not an education system.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><b>Background</b></p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0in">
First of all, I like the definition of governance provided by a
report on  <i>Governing America's Schools: Changing the Rules</i> -
“governance is defined as who makes what decisions, and in what
manner. In education, the 'who' is everybody from state legislators
to parents. The 'what' covers everything from standards to parent
involvement. The 'in what manner' or 'how' is everything from
decisions made autonomously to those made within a framework
established by others.&quot;  One cannot resolve the issue of freedom
and accountability without looking at all levels of decision-making,
and there are many.  
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">To aid my
understanding, I did a quick scan of the PEI School’s Act and its
various regulations, and the teacher’s collective agreement.  I did
this to gain mote knowledge of the issue.  I was looking for an
understanding of the decisions that can be made by a teacher, a
principal, a trustee, or any other decision-maker without having to
check with a higher level of authority.  I did not find an answer,
although I am sure it exists if I knew where to look.  My conclusion,
although it may be an unfair one, is that any decision, other than
“no” requires consultation with more senior members of the
Department.</p>

<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">■&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Accountability for student performance.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">The most interesting
document I came across, however, was a 2011 report from the OECD that
shows a direct link between PISA test results and school autonomy. 
Autonomy, or freedom to act, varies from country to country but may
include such things as allocation of  resources, hiring and
dismissing teachers, formulating budgets, decisions about curricula
and assessment, course offerings and textbooks.   
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Simply stated, there is
a direct relationship between school performance and school autonomy.
 In the words of the OECD Report:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in">“In countries where schools have
	greater autonomy over what is taught and how students 
	</p></li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in">are
assessed, students tend to perform better. 
</p>
<ul>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in">In countries where schools account
	for their results by posting achievement data publicly, schools that
	enjoy greater autonomy in resource allocation tend to show better
	student performance than those with less autonomy. 
	</p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in">In countries where there are no
	such accountability arrangements, schools with greater autonomy in
	resource allocation tend to perform worse.” 
	</p></li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Finally, one must
understand that ensuring freedom to act does not itself guarantee
that one will act; having the freedom, however, increases the odds in
favour of action.</p>

&nbsp;<b>Key System Decision makers</b></p>
<p style="line-height: 0.17in; margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0in"><a name="Body"></a>
Even with a cursory examination of our education system, it soon
becomes obvious that there are many levels of professional decision
makers.  By this, I refer to levels of decision making about the
instruction of a learner.  In fact, the number is startling when
compared with areas such as health and the law where the user of 
service is dealt with primarily by one level of professional.  In my
consideration, I’ve excluded parents because, it seems to me, in
the current organization parents have little decision-making  role
except whether or not to send their child to school.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">It seems to me that
education is a state run enterprise.  The Department of Educaton pays
practically all the costs, hires all staff, pays all staff, defines
what is to be taught by whom, when, where, and for how long,
certifies  teachers.  Not only is education state run, it is also a
monopoly.  I sometimes wonder why our American cousins are so
dismissive about our health care and still accept a government run
education systemHow does this differ from the state run business of
former communist countries?</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">Regulations for
state enterprises should be amended to give them more flexibility
amid increasing competition, says Piyasvasti Amranand, the president
of Thai Airways International Plc (THAI).</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in"><br />
<br />

</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
During
a seminar entitled &quot;National Agenda on Thailand's
Competitiveness&quot; held yesterday, Piyasvasti said the government
should consider four factors if it wants to improve competitiveness
of Thai state enterprises: amend rules; competition, clear regulation
framework, and fund mobilisation through the stock markets. 
</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
He
said easing the rules would enhance the flexibility of state
enterprises, leading to higher competitiveness. The National Economic
and Social Developmen Board (NESDB) and the Finance Ministry should
be the two organisations that play a vital role in amending rules. 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">He said the ministry
was also working on a corporate governance framework, performance
monitoring and legislative and regulatory review.<br />
<br />
“The
proposed Bill seeks to provide for the duties and responsibilities of
the minister responsible for State enterprises and parastatals and to
cordify the corporate governance framework among other matters,”
said Moyo. <br />
<br />
He said the restructuring of State enterprises
and parastatals was progressing slowly.</p>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">A <b>government-owned
corporation</b>, <b>state-owned company</b>, <b>state-owned entity</b>,
<b>state enterprise</b>, <b>publicly-owned corporation</b>,
<b>government business enterprise</b>, or <b>parastatal</b> is a
legal entity created by a <u><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government" name="Government">government</a></u>
to undertake <u><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commerce" name="Commerce">commercial</a></u>
activities on behalf of an owner government. Their legal status
varies from being a part of government into stock companies with a
state as a regular stockholder. There is no standard definition of a
government-owned corporation (GOC) or state-owned enterprise (SOE),
although the two terms can be used interchangeably. The defining
characteristics are that they have a distinct legal form and they are
established to operate in commercial affairs. While they may also
have public policy objectives, GOCs should be differentiated from
other forms of government agencies or state entities established to
pursue purely non-financial objectives that have no need or goal of
satisfying the shareholders with return on their investment through
price increase or <u><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dividends" name="Dividends">dividends</a></u>.<sup>[</sup><u><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" name="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><sup><i>citation

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in"><br />
<br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">GOCs can be fully
owned or partially owned by Government. As a definitional issue, it
is difficult to determine categorically what level of state ownership
would qualify an entity to be considered as &quot;state-owned&quot;,
since governments can also own regular <u><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock" name="Stock">stock</a></u>,
without implying any special interference. As an example, the <u><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Chinese_Investment_Corporation&action=edit&redlink=1" name="Chinese Investment Corporation (page does not exist)">Chinese
Investment Corporation</a></u> agreed in 2007 to acquire a
9.9% interest in the global investment bank <u><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morgan_Stanley" name="Morgan Stanley">Morgan
Stanley</a></u>, but it is unlikely that this would qualify
the latter as a government-owned corporation. Government-owned or
state-run enterprises are often the result of <u><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporatization" name="Corporatization">corporatization</a></u>,
a process in which government agencies and departments are
re-organized as semi-autonomous corporate entities, sometimes with
partial shares listed on stock exchanges.</p>
