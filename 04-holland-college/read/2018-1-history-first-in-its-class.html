	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">A
	brief account of how the arrival of Rev. Harvey Douglas Smith in Bay
	du Vin led to the founding of New Brunswick’s first rural high
	school.</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify"><u><b>THE
	COMMUNITY</b></u></p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify"><u><b>EARLY
	EDUCATION</b></u></p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">Soon
	after getting settled in their new community, settler’s thoughts
	turned to education. The first home-school in Black River was
	convened in a barn belonging to Archibald Cameron, Sr.; the first
	school in Bay du Vin was operated at the home of James Graham near
	Buckley’s Bridge, The task of teaching usually fell to most
	educated person in the community and classes were usually held in
	homes.  Records show that, at least by 1817, a qualified teacher,
	Hugh MacDougald, had been hired to provide instruction 
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">In
	1825, residents of Black River petitioned successfully for a school
	which, as I understand it, was erected near the lane now leading to
	St. Stephen's Church.   This school appears to have served all of
	Black River and as far east as lower Bay du Vin, and included
	trustees from both communities.</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p lang="en-CA" align="justify">Although
	a closer examination of records may show otherwise, History of Bay
	du Vin (1) reports a school at the mouth of the Bay du Vin River by
	1830, perhaps the Cameron School and a school in Bay side by 1845,
	and the Little Branch School around 1855.  MacDougall (2) reports
	that the Little Branch School burned shortly after construction but
	was soon replaced. 
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">Each
	District had a one room school handling all grades usually up to
	Grade 8 or perhaps Grade 9.  Very few students in the area went
	beyond the studies available at their local school. Those who were
	lucky, attended high school classes in Loggieville or Chatham and
	boarded with relatives or friends.  At the time it was possible for
	students to write Normal school entrance exams and be admitted
	directly to Normal school after Grade 9. But, as the next section
	points out, change was afoot within the Department of Education,
	change that awaite a communit looking for a partner</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify"><u><b>REV.
	DOULAS SMITH</b></u></p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">The
	Rev. Douglas Smith took up his duties at St. John’s Anglican
	Church, Bay du Vin, in August of 1937.  Born in Saint John, NB on
	January 10, 1912, he graduated from King’s College, Halifax in
	1934 with a BA.  degree. Although ordained a Deacon t St Paul’s
	Anglican Church in St. John 1n 1936, Rev. Smith served as a junior
	Master at Rothsay Collegiate during 1936-37.  His official duties
	began at St. John the Evangelist Church in Bay du Vin on August 24,
	1937. Recognizing the needs of the area, later that year. He started
	classes “in his own study at the Rectory”; the next year he
	hired a teacher to help him.  This event marked the beginning of the
	Miramichi Rural High School 
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">Information
	about the Rev. Douglas Smith and his contribution to education in
	the Miramichi was the subject of a four-part article in the Archives
	Corner. Published by the Fredericton diocesan Synod and included in
	the next session.</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify"><u><b>THE
	FIRST RURAL HIGH SCHOOL</b></u></p>
	<p align="justify">Rev.
	Smith’s vision of a high school Education for all young people in
	New Brunswick was share by Fletcher Peacock, Chief Superintendent of
	Education and W. K. Tibert, Director of Vocational Education. They
	soon recruited Mr. A. T. Patstone as the first principal.  Mr.
	Patstones’s paper on the founding of the first rural High School
	is included in a later section.

	<p align="justify"><b>OFFICIAL
	OPENING</b></p>
	<p align="justify">Classes
	were relocated to the new building, I believe, in January, 1940; a
	formal opening was held in October.</p>

	</p>
	<p align="justify">“<i>During
	this time, another had joined forces with Mr. Smith, Fred A. Fowlie
	of Fowlie’s Mills.  Dreams became visions.  Visions became
	reality.  An interview was arranged with Educational authorities at
	Fredericton”.  There was a plea put forth for assistance and
	encouragement to promote a larger school idea for the areas of Black
	River and Bay du Vin</i></p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify"><i>The
	officials were found most sympathetic.  The delegation came back
	encouraged and carried the plan to the people.    As a result, the
	six districts of Black River Bridge, Victoria. Little Branch, Bay
	Side, Bay du Vin River and Bay du Vin Beach decided to consolidate
	and join forces to establish the first Rural High School of the
	Province.</i></p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify"><i>A
	temporary School Board was appointed to carry on the construction.
	Rev. D. Smith was the chairman, A.M. Cameron, vice–chairman,
	Harrison T. Smith, treasurer, Ian MacNaughton, secretary, Woodbury
	Williston, Bertrand Williston and Jack Godfrey as additional
	members”.</i></p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">Classes
	proved so popular that they had to relocate first to the church
	basement and later to the church hall across the road.  Smith also
	hired two additional teachers, Miss Elizabeth Stevenson and Mrs.
	Dorothy Claytonburg. 
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">On
	the opening of classes in September, 1939, still in Bay du vin,
	numbers had grown to 67 students, a Principal, Mr. A. T. Patstone
	and teachers, Miss Jean Barnes in Home Economics, and Miss Beryl
	MacAloney in academic subjects. 
	</p>
	<p align="justify">  
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">The
	program for the formal opening on Tuesday, October 1, 1940,
	identified the following as features of the school:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><p align="justify">Air-conditioned
		heating</p></li>
		<li><p align="justify">Pressure
		water system</p></li>
		<li><p align="justify">Green

		<li><p align="justify">Modern

		<li><p align="justify">Electric
		lights, Delco Plant</p></li>
	</ul>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">The
	new school cost, as I recall, $13,000 and opened in January 1940. 
	On a personal note, my first visit to MRHS was late in the fall of
	1939 when George Watling and biked down to see it.  It was an
	impressive building for a rural area.  As the photo above shows, it
	was two-story with two classrooms on each level at the front and an
	auditorium on the second floor at the back.  At the back on the
	lower floor were the principal’s office, boys’ and girls’
	washrooms and the furnace room.</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">MRHS
	had electric lights, a 32-volt system, operated from a bank of
	glass-encased batteries with a small gasoline engine switching on
	and off automatically to charge the batteries. It also had a
	coal-fired furnace.  A very tall flagpole stood in the front yard by
	the driveway.  It looked like a ship’s mast and took a team of
	horses and special rigging to erect.</p>

	<p align="justify"><u><b>Programs</b></u></p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">In
	the program for the opening of the new school, the aims of the new
	Miramichi Rural High School were given as:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><p align="justify"><i>To
		provide a satisfactory type of education, designed to meet the
		demands of the community and which will best fill the requirements
		of the individual</i></p></li>
		<li><p align="justify"><i>To
		foster and implant those habits of co-operation and economic
		practices necessary for complete living and for the formation and
		development of character.</i></p></li>
		<li><p align="justify"><i>To
		foster agricultural projects and to lend to the rural social
		activities of the community.</i></p></li>
	</ul>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">In
	addition to the usual subjects, offerings included home economics,
	shop and music; in fact, an orchestra had been formed by the fall of
	1940. In the early years, students were expected to plant school
	gardens.  It seems to me that we were paired and each pair had a
	small plot.  Come fall, the vegetables were canned and kept in the
	closet under the stairs</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">Educational
	programs for adults included weaving, adult discussion groups, music
	and games.  Readers are encouraged to read the paper, undated, by A.
	T. Patstone and included as Appendix 1.  
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify"><u><b>Transportation</b></u></p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">Attendance
	was not limited to Anglicans or to local students.  Students from
	Black River walked or biked to Bay du Vin during good weather and
	traveled by horse and sled in the winter; others boarded in Bay du
	Vin during the bad weather.   Norman Glendenning recalls
	transporting students to Bay du Vin by horse and sled and even to
	Bay Side after the new school was built.  During the day, his horse
	was stabled either at Goymer Williston’s or Harrison Smith’s
	barn; Norman always carried some hay and oats for the horse while it
	was stabled and had to tend to the animals during school break.</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">The
	first motor transport appears to have been provided by Goymer
	Williston in the back of a 2-3-ton truck with a box on the back</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">This
	was followed in the fall of 1940 by the bus shown below which Eddie
	Godfrey recalls as a one and one-half ton Fargo chassis purchased
	from the W.S. Loggie Co.  The body, I believe, was fabricated by the
	Fowlie Brothers of Little Branch.    When the Godfrey Bros.
	purchased their second bus, the one pictured above was sold to
	Gordon Dick of Upper Napan and used to transport students from Napan
	and Point aux Carr to school in Chatham.  Those communities were not
	part of the MRHS school district</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	<p align="justify">Their
	second bus, purchased in 1944 at St. John, NB was a commercial bus
	khaki colour (a wartime colour); the third bus was a 21/2-ton Fargo,
	blue and white, built in Levis, P,Q; their final bus was a 1947
	International built in Saint John.  The Godfrey Bros. ended their
	business in 1955 and the remaining buses were sold.</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">Later
	the contract for school transportation shifted to Tom Adams.  Della
	(Adams) O’Neil thinks that her father may have built the body on
	the smaller and older bus himself.
