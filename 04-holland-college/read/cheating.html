  Cheating
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Published as Education 20/20 Issue article, this piece analyzes rising academic cheating and proposes competency-based education as a solution. Glendenning documents various cheating trends—plagiarism software arms races, file-sharing mentality, test anxiety, grade inflation—and identifies systemic causes: poor teaching, lack of rapport, and emphasis on grades over learning. He argues that traditional subject-based testing is vulnerable to cheating, while competency-based programs, which assess observable real-world performance over multiple occasions, make cheating nearly impossible. The document reveals Don&#x27;s ability to connect educational philosophy to practical behavioral issues.</div>

<p><span><b><i>		BUT NOT ON EDUCATION</i></b></span><span> <span class="Apple-converted-space">      </span></span><b>_______________________________________________________________________</b><span></span><span><b>A scan of items on cheating in The New York Times over the past few weeks, reveals that:</b></span></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>cheating continues to be a problem; it may be on the upswing or it may be that we catch more cheaters</b></p>
<p><b>Some schools require students to have their papers checked by a “plagiarism program”</b></p>
<p><b>Some cheating may be attributed to the widespread practice of file sharing, lack of understanding of intellectual property rights,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b>Poor teachers who practice sloppy teaching, fail to establish rapport with students,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b>Teachers as well as students are worried about high stakes testing</b></p>
<p><b>A number of law schools in the USA raised the grades of<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>recent graduates to gie them a better chance of finding employment with leading law firms.</b></p>
<p><b>Grade five students at a New York school were given back their test books so that they could reake some of the questions.</b></p>
<p><b>Students in the digital age see information as something to be retrieved and passed along, without really ever being internalized or mastered</b></p>
<p><b>One survey of 7-12</b><b><sup>th</sup></b><b> graders revealed that<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>52 percent admitted to some form of web-based cheating.</b></p>
<p><b>Cheating is more common in classrooms where students do not have a real<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>relationship with teachers, students feel that tasks and assignments are pointless or overwhelming, how well students are doing means more than<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>what they are doing, and achievement is viewed as a competition.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b>Some universities have special technology equipped test rooms where students are under surveillance when writing exams</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>A system of determining student achievement on the basis of school subjects and written tests is vulnerable to cheating; elaborate systems to detect cheating and punish cheaters will likely do little to reduce it.</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>So what’s the answer? One contributor, who had served on Cornell University’s Academic Integrity Hearing Board, recommended that students be required to take an ethics course. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That certainly would do no harm but a better way, I believe, would be to design or adopt a system where performance is based on observable behaviour.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Outcomes based education is one such system; unfortunately, its seems to have given way to curriculum based objectives which does not have the same potential; the other is competency based education (CBE).</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Competency based programs are modeled<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>on relevant life roles.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The process begins with a detailed analysis of the competencies, or actions, performed in real life.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>From the analysis, skills are selected to be developed in the school setting.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Tests are used to diagnose and measure, however, actual grades are based on the persons observed performance using a rating scale consistent with that applied in real life.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>It is virtually impossible to cheat in a competency based education model; normally a rating would only be confirmed basd on a number of observations of a presentation being made, a report being given, the problem being solved.</b></p>
