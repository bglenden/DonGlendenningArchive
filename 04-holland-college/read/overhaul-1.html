<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 108%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 108%"><b>Education
is complex; information plays a key role.  Learners have different
interests, experiences, capabilities and needs; they also fill a
variety of life roles. Those who teach, or otherwise serve learners,
must be very clear in their communication. Conceptual clarity
heightens our understanding of key words and concepts; lack of
clarity is a significant issue for public education. Lack of clarity
could signal conflicting ideas and levels of discomfort or
disagreement from within the education family group itself; some say 
“clarity” is also related to self confidence.    Conceptual
clarify is also a must in planning and assessing performance</b></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 108%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 108%"><b>An
organization’s structure outlines how services are to be directed
to achieve purposes, goals, roles and responsibilities.  While
organizations may take many forms, service organizations, like
education, are usually local or decentralized giving members freedom
to respond to individual and local demands. In recent years, however,
it appears to the writer that education is increasingly being
considered a product rather than a service.</b></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 108%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 108%">Learning
is an individual matter; only the learner can learn, however,
learning may occur in a group setting and sometimes may even require
others or be part of the teaching-learning process.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 108%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 108%">The
Dictionary of Education (Good) defines education as “the aggregate
of all the processes by means of which a person develops abilities of
positive value in the society in which he lives”. Given this,
readers will understand, therefore, why I stuttered when asked by a
senior Island educator where I got my education. While there are
bound to be differences of opinion about meanings and understandings
of words, I believe that the Department of Education has a special
responsibility to share their meanings of frequently used words –
especially those as “meaning laden” as found in education.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 108%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 108%">Typical
education services include:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0in">Information
	- Recent and independent information</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0in">Counselling
	– help to people making decision about their education needs</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0in">A
	governing structure - a body with vision, responsibility and
	resources.</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0in">Instruction
	- diagnosis, presentations, practice and access generally to
	resources 
	</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0in">Quality
	Assurance – to assure Islanders that their learning experiences
	meet community standards.</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0in">Products
	and Technology - Access educational materials and technology</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0in">Funding
	- to a level and in a manner that is equitable for all Islanders.</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0in">Human
	Resources - Teachers, administrators, counsellors, advisors.
	assistants and others</p></li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 108%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 108%">Education
services are delivered to citizens in a variety of ways including
family members, friends, tutors, teachers, media, public and private
institutions, created and  directed by Provincial Departments of
Education; but education also arises from activities undertaken by 
individuals and organizations npt part of the formal system. an
education system outlines how services are to be directed to achieve
purposes, goals, roles and responsibilities.  While organizations may
take many forms, service organizations, like education, are usual
local or decentralized giving front-line members freedom to respond
to individual and local demands. In recent years, however, it appears
to the writer that education is increasingly being considered a
product (graduation diploma, degree or other credential) - a change
that may work to the disadvantage of quality.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 108%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 108%"> It
is the writer’s view that a number of structural issues interfere
with the functioning of our education sector; chief among them are
the following:

	<li><p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0in"><b>Distinction
	between going to school or getting an education</b>
	- A recent World Bank report and some comments about the differences
	between going to school and getting an education. As I understand
	it, schools focus on helping young people learn traditional
	subjects. Education, on the other hand, includes traditional
	subjects but adds a significant component on development of mental
	agility, character development, creativity, problem solving,
	personal development, analysis, self-assessment, discussion, etc.
	Schooling, is a part or stage of learning that takes place in
	facilities specifically designed for education purposes. Experiences
	in school are an important part of education but only a part.
	Holistic rating scales and self- assessment are education tweaks.</p></li>
