</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Comprehensive proposal by Don Glendenning for establishing a CFPEI Education Improvement Fund to address systemic education challenges. Document analyzes criticisms of education (accountability, cost, relevance, standards, flexibility) and identifies priority areas for improvement. Proposes endowment-based grantmaking to support education reform projects while distinguishing foundation&#x27;s role from direct project implementation. Details fund governance through advisory committee and competitive grant process. Demonstrates Don&#x27;s deep commitment to education quality and strategic philanthropy, likely connecting to his 18 years as Holland College&#x27;s first president.</div>

<p><b>COMMUNITY FOUNDATION OF PRINCE EDWARD ISLAND</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>EDUCATION IMPROVEMENT FUND</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>BACKGROUND:</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>Education is under considerable scrutiny and pressure to reform. Much of the criticism revolves around accountability, cost, relevance, standards and flexibility.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Some of the criticism is valid; some is not.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Provincial governments across the country have responded in a number of ways including:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>restructuring school boards</p>
<p>lengthening the school day</p>
<p>encouraging charter schools</p>
<p>increasing teacher qualifications</p>
<p>specifying learning outcomes</p>
<p>introducing external examinations</p>
<p>providing teacher aides, and</p>
<p>adding computers.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>These changes will help but other changes are also needed.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>It is generally recognized that the usual components of the education system are elementary, secondary and post secondary institutions, the Department of Education, School Boards, private schools and distance delivery arrangements.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Educational improvement may be impacted, however, by such external forces or bodies as teacher certification requirements, trade and professional associations, employers, labour groups, trustees, parent advisory groups and student councils.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>All stakeholders must be considered as part of the improvement process.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Some of the desired improvements may require action by more than one component of the delivery system.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>An additional or different change agent may be helpful.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>An <b>Educational Improvement Fund</b> within the Community Foundation of Prince Edward Island will make a valuable contribution to the change process.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>THE FOUNDATION</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The Community foundation of Prince Edward Island is a general purpose, non-government, non-profit organization established under the laws of Prince Edward Island.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is also registered as a charitable organization with Revenue Canada.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The foundation’s mission is to meet community needs by providing a vehicle for many different donors to exercise their varied charitable interests an a minimum of cost and a maximum convenience.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Gifts to the Foundation will be invested in a common pool with the earnings distributed in the form of grants to a wide variety of non-profit groups throughout Prince Edward Island.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>PURPOSE</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The purpose of the proposal is to seek funds to stimulate, encourage and support improvements in public education.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The object is to establish an <b>Education Improvement Fund </b>in the form of an endowment.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The fund will exist in perpetuity, only the earnings will be used to support educational improvement.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>CONCEPT</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>Our goal is to establish an educational improvement Fund for the purpose of encouraging and supporting improvements in public education in Prince Edward Island.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Once established, the availability of project funds will be announced and proposals will be invited.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The Foundation may initiate discussions with one or more organizations to stimulate proposals in areas of interest to the foundation or where it is thought beneficial to have a number of stakeholders involved.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>An advisory committee will be convened to advise the foundation on such matters.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Details of project criteria, communications strategy and granting procedures are yet to be worked out.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The Foundation itself, will not undertake projects.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Project reports will be received by the foundation.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>PRIORITIES</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The Foundation has identified the following as priority areas for educational improvement:</p>
<p><b>Accountability </b>in education is widely dispersed among teachers, principals, School Board staff and the Department of Education.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This may result in good teaching being inadequately recognized and rewarded and poor teaching condoned.</p>
<p><b>Costs </b>continue to rise.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The delivery model allows little opportunity and few rewards for containing or reducing costs.</p>
<p><b>Relevance</b> of some programming to later life is improving but still a challenge and is often sacrificed to the requirements of higher education.</p>
<p><b>Standards</b> within the system bear little relationship to those encountered in life outside the education system.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Alternatives should be explored.</p>
<p><b>Flexibility </b>has been lost in a system of rigid class schedules, a mammoth school transportation system, negotiated student-teacher ratios, regulated school days and years, and prescribed course outlines and school texts. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>The Foundation recognizes also that priorities for educational improvement will require periodic review and may be amended accordingly.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is likely, furthermore, that educational improvement will benefit from partnerships within the education system as well as with agencies from outside.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Such partnerships can only be dealt with on a project by project basis.</p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>FUND GUIDELINES</b><b></b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>While many of the improvements in education may be undertaken inexpensively, some of the major interventions may require several years in order to make the necessary changes and to integrate them into the on-going education system. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Some preliminary guidelines include:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>grants are intended to impact on priorities identified above,</p>
<p>grants will not be made in support of an individual student,</p>
<p>applicants are expected to show how the results of the project will be incorporated into on-going activities,</p>
<p>grants will not be made for ongoing operating expenses,</p>
<p>grants will not be made to remove a deficit,</p>
<p>the decision to fund or not fund a project rests with the Foundation,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>the Foundation may seek outside advice when reviewing proposals,</p>
<p>the Foundation may encourage the submission of proposals which it feels will contribute to educational improvement,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The foundation may work with an applicant to develop a proposal before a project is improved.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The goal of the Foundation is an Educational Improvement Fund in the form of an endowment.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The Fund will exist in perpetuity; only the income will be used to support educational improvement.</p>
