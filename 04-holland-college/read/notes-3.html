  Notes-3
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Meeting notes from March 15, 2017 at Haviland Club (Don, Larry, Jack, Mike) followed by a conference call with CVA (Canadian Vocational Association) Executive on March 16. Don documents communications from R. Lance Hogan at Eastern Illinois University and outlines early curriculum development history including models like POET, Technical Education Research Centre work, and others that informed Holland College&#x27;s eventual choice of DACUM. The notes record CVA&#x27;s interest in the initiative, their ability to promote via website and newsletter, and questions about Holland College&#x27;s response, timing, and funding sources. This document demonstrates Don&#x27;s strategic stakeholder engagement and his ability to navigate institutional relationships while maintaining project focus. His awareness of DACUM&#x27;s international reach and historical context shows scholarly depth.</div>

  <li class="li3">Agreed that, Ideally, we would like to have both CVA and Hogan as part of our activities</li>
  <li class="li3">Confirmed that HC first developed a set of guiding principles and then went looking for a model to support its thinking; included in our search was POET (Performance Oriented Electronics Training at CFB, Trenton?); Technical Education Research Centre, Cambridge University. (one analysis was Biomedical equipment; the other may have been mechanical technician); DACUM; A new college in Michigan – cannot recall name; the work in the Bedford Stuyvesant Borough of New York</li>

  <li class="li3">Pierre Morin, Wayne Wilson, Anna Kays and one other</li>
  <li class="li3">Wayne commented about how active/well received is the CVA website and monthly newsletter</li>
  <li class="li3">I updated them on Bob’s passing, the book he coauthored, the interest of Eastern Illinois university, that Bob’s files had gone to the USA</li>
  <li class="li3">Briefed them on our thinking; I mentioned the phases as early models, advent and impact of DACUM, and the international spread of the analyses process,</li>
  <li class="li3">Their main questions were about the HC reaction, tentative date, Canada 150 money, whether this would end with a book or report.</li>
  <li class="li3">They spoke about using their website and newsletter to promote</li>
  <li class="li3">Spoke about my search of the internet for spots where the model is practiced; I assured them that we’d be happy to have CVA participate and would keep them informed.</li>
