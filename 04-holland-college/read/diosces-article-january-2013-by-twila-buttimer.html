<div class="reader-summary">Comprehensive two-part diocesan archives article by Twila Buttimer documenting Rev. Harvey Douglas Smith&#x27;s role founding MRHS. Part One (1912 birth in Saint John, Kings College B.A. 1934, ordained 1936-1938) describes Smith&#x27;s 1937 arrival at Bay du Vin and his grassroots educational initiative with 8 students in the rectory study, expanding to 67 by September 1939. Part Two recounts Smith and Fred Fowlie&#x27;s successful lobbying for provincial funding, the school board (chaired by Smith, with A.M. Cameron, Harrison T. Smith, Ian MacNaughton), construction completion January 1940, curriculum including weaving courses, and Smith&#x27;s 1946-47 return as principal attempting a residential program for scholarship boys. Smith&#x27;s later career (Montreal 1948, Spokane 1955) and 1969 death in Wolfville are documented. The article credits Don as a primary source (&quot;Dr. Don Glendenning of Charlottetown (a student of the Rev. H.

<p><b>THE REV. HARVEY DOUGLAS SMITH<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>-<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>MAKING A DIFFERENCE ON THE MIRAMICHI</b></p>
<p><b>PART ONE<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p>When Archbishop Richardson appointed a young deacon named Harvey Douglas Smith to serve St. John’s Church in Hardwicke, it is doubtful that he knew the positive life changes this appointment would bring to many young Miramichiers.<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Smith is credited with being the founder of Miramichi Rural High School, the first rural high school in NB, the story recounted here.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Where possible, H. D. Smith’s own words are used. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Born in Saint John on January 10, 1912, Harvey Douglas Smith was the son of Harvey Allan Smith and Ethel May Whitehead .<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>His father worked for the intercolonial railway and the family was connected with Trinity Church, where Douglas was baptized. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In 1934, H. Douglas Smith graduated from Kings College in Halifax with a B.A. degree.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>On May 31, 1936, he was ordained a deacon at St. Paul’s Church in Saint John and he was priested on June 6, 1938 at the Cathedral in Fredericton. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Smith worked as a Junior Master at the Rothesay Collegiate School from 1936-1937, resigning in June 1937. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>On August 24, 1937, his duties as deacon in St. John the Evangelist Church in Bay du Vin, Parish of Hardwicke officially began. <b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p>In Hardwicke, Smith soon realized that few of the local youth were attending high school because they had to go to Chatham, 20 miles distant, which would require travelling each day or boarding in town. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>With his teaching background, Smith set out to improve the opportunities for rural students.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In the fall of 1937, Smith called Dr. A.S. McFarlane, the Chief Superintendent of Education and “we talked about the possibilities of improving the educational services in this district.” <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>By March 1938, he reported “ Since that time I have carried on the high school work of which I told you (McFarlane) , among eight students, four days a week” in his study in the rectory.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Smith also spoke with Dr<b>. </b>A.P. Paterson, Minister of Education about a consolidated school in the district.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Noting that he already had the support of a few local residents, Smith wrote that he needed to concentrate on “talking the matter up with the several districts and getting your (Paterson’s) approval and help. “<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This would require “a good many personal talks with families” – but of course, these personal talks would take much time and “with the school work and the pressure of parish duties, I am already beginning to feel the strain.” (Smith to McFarlane– 29 March 1938).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Smith recommended bringing in a 1<sup>st</sup> class teacher for the June term, who could board at the rectory but would need the salary from government grant.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>McFarlane responded that teachers in private school could not be paid from a government grant – but if the teacher was employed by the trustees it would work. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Smith’s enthusiasm and hard work paid off for the original 8 students soon grew to 18 and the school moved to the church basement.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The next move was to the church hall as numbers increased to 63.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>By 1938, Smith had hired 2 teachers (Elizabeth Stevenson and Dorothy Claytonburg) to help him.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Local community leaders joined him in his initiative to secure a high school for the area of Black River and Bay du Vin.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  			</span><b>Continued next month</b></p>

<p><b>THE REV. HARVEY DOUGLAS SMITH<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>-<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>MAKING A DIFFERENCE ON THE MIRAMICHI &amp; ELSEWHERE</b></p>
<p><b>PART TWO<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b>The new school required support locally and in Fredericton.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Douglas Smith and Fred Fowlie (farmer &amp; businessman) of Fowlie’s Mill travelled to Fredericton to enlist the support of officials in the Department of Education to lobby the Government to build a rural high school on the Miramichi. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Education officials, especially Dr. Fletcher Peacock, Director of Educational Services, were supportive – and encouraged the Miramichiers to go ahead in 1938 with their pilot project.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Surprisingly, they were also told if their school districts united, their rural high school would be supported. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Back in the Miramichi, each of the six neighbouring school boards, after some explaining and convincing words by Smith, voted unanimously to consolidate.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>After two more delegations from the Miramichi to Fredericton, their efforts met with success.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>On July 21, 1939, the Department of Education approved the request for a high school in the Bay du Vin area, to be built on 5 acres of land donated by local supporter, Harrison Smith.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Before the approval was granted, the Legislature had amended the 1932 Schools Act in order to allow Cabinet to guarantee the bonds or debentures issued by boards of school trustees of any consolidated district.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This was meant to encourage the consolidation of districts and the building of rural high schools.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b>Following the amendment, six districts, namely Bay du Vin, Bay du Vin Beach, Bayside, Black River, Little Branch and Victoria, joined forces to build the first rural high school at Bayside, Northumberland County.<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>A temporary School Board was appointed to carry on the construction.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was chaired by the Rev. D. Smith; Archibald Cameron was the vice-chair; Harrison T. Smith was treasurer; Ian MacNaughton was secretary.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Other members were: Woodbury Williston, Bertrand Williston and Jack Godfrey. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>While the new school was being built, a temporary consolidated school opened (in the church basement &amp; hall) in Bay du Vin in September 1939 with 60+ students.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Its first principal was<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Mr. A. T. Patstone, who was very interested in the consolidated and rural school idea and had academic training and some courses in agricultural science.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He was joined by Miss Jean Barnes, who taught Home Economics, and Miss Beryl MacAloney taught college preparatory subjects.<span class="Apple-converted-space">     </span></b></p>
<p><b>Smith’s success in securing local support for the new school was shown in the actual construction in which many local men assisted with some (or all) of their labour being unpaid and that the school was built for $12,000.00 <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Although the first sod for the new school was only turned on September 19, 1939, by a lot of hard work, it was occupied by January 1940!.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Students from Grades 7 to 12 attended Miramichi Rural High School (MRHS) , where they could major in agriculture, home economics or college preparatory so that they could live “successfully and happily in the area” which supported the school. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>What we take for granted now – that students could gain a high school education without going away from home and at a low cost to their parents – was fought for and earned on the Miramichi. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Correspondence (preserved at PANB) from the Rev. H. D. Smith to the Department of Education in the 1938-1940 era show how much effort Smith and supporters made to secure the new school.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Though the new school was only formally opened on October 1, 1940, a class of 8 graduated in June 1940.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Of course, these 8 graduates were the students who had begun studies with Douglas Smith in 1937.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b>MRHS was the first of some 50 rural high schools built in NB, the second one being at Campobello.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>These were no ordinary high schools – here,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>education was a combination of academic and practical training, with the students offered home economics and shop training (in fact most of the MRHS’s furniture was made in its shop facilities).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Rural projects were emphasized, both agricultural projects on the student’s home farm and the school boasted a large garden where pairs of students had small plots which they planted; in the fall, their produce was canned – all part of the learning process.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Adults too benefitted from the new school<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>-- evening courses were offered for them. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b>School consolidation necessitated transporting students to the new facilities.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Thus school buses, which originally were primitive and not purpose-built, were necessary.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>See attached photo for an example of these early buses<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>-- this one owned by the Godfrey Bros., which transported the MRHS students.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></b></p>
<p><b>In 1940, the Rev. Douglas Smith resigned from the Parish of Hardwicke and moved to the Diocese of Nova Scotia and PEI.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As many Miramichiers have discovered, Smith found that he could leave the Miramichi but it still had a hold on him. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b>END OF PART II<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>-- TO BE CONTINUED</b></p>
<p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>As many others discovered Although in NS as Chaplain at RCAF, Greenwood, NS, evidently Douglas Smith did not think his work on the Miramichi was complete. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In March 1946, he wrote to Dr. Fletcher Peacock, currently Superintendent of Education saying that Peacock might remember that in connection with Miramichi Rural “I felt that I would like to see a residence built for youngsters who lived beyond the reach of organized educational services.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>For the next 2 or 3 years I would like to devote my time to giving such a project a try<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>- beginning September 1946.” <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Peacock’s response was immediate (March 11, 1946) and enthusiastic.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He wrote that we “are very grateful for the boost you gave the Rural School idea when you were in the Miramichi, and the prospect of having your enthusiastic leadership in the further development of this is pleasing indeed. “<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Peacock explained that “we are not satisfied with the progress that the Miramichi School has made since Principal Patstone joined the Air Force in 1941” and we would like to make the school a success if for no other reason that “to save our reputation.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Approving Smith’s idea to have a “residence in which the Principal could live and look after a group of students” , he agreed to meet with Smith in Fredericton<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>as soon as possible. <span class="Apple-converted-space">     </span></p>
<p>The Rev. Douglas Smith took a leave from the Diocese of NS &amp; PEI and returned to the Miramichi as Principal of MRHS in September 1946, for what turned out to be only one school year.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>To a limited extent, his school residence project did succeed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In April 1947, he told Peacock that “the experiment with three boys this winter has worked out most satisfactorily” and he wrote that for next year “we have a house now in conjunction with a regional school.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is at the disposal of any boy who is scholarship material” and who cannot attend school because of “clothing, books or travel.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Smith himself would stay and be in charge of this residence (if filled with 12-15 boys) while someone else would be in charge of classroom work etc. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Evidently, the dream of filling the residence did not come to fruition as Smith did not stay.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>While at MRHS, he oversaw a significant exhibition of arts and crafts at the school on May 29-30.<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Weaving produced at the school’s 3 month course was displayed as was shrub wood, leather crafts, wood carving and hand painted work (buttons, jewelry, slippers, purses, tooled leather belts etc.).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Attendance at the exhibition exceeded 400 people , all of whom were impressed with the completed products and the school itself.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Smith suggested<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>that since the Province wishes to promote crafts, it should be done by adding courses to the rural high schools.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Dr. Peacock<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>supported of Smith’s ideas – but for whatever reason, he was not with the school in September 1947.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>In 1948, the Rev. H. Douglas Smith transferred to the Diocese of Montreal, where was licensed as Priest – Assistant in Parish of Trinity Memorial Church in Montreal. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><b>Leave from Montreal???</b><span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></p>
