  05 CANADA COLLEGE
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Don proposes a national &quot;Canada College&quot;—not a teaching institution but a credit bank aggregating learning from schools, universities, colleges, work, self-study, and life experience into recognized credentials. He notes BC&#x27;s Open Learning Agency operates a limited version; New Zealand has established a Qualification Authority. Don advocates a system measuring performance rather than time-based credit, drawing on expertise from certification bodies and competency-based education programs. He humorously suggests applying his own experience (building bridges, installing drainage) as portfolio evidence for a civil engineering credential.</div>

<p>CANADA COLLEGE</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Schools no longer have a monopoly on the delivery of education and training.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Employers, labor unions, trade and professional associations, consulting agencies, and many others now deliver courses, workshops, and other training sessions to employees, members and the public at large.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Some agencies deliver a series of courses which result in a credential; other organizations simply deliver stand-alone short courses.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Some large US corporations offer their own degree programs.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The trend towards a multiplicity of delivery agencies is now well established in Canada and, given the current constitutional discussions, the proliferation will likely continue.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Canadians who are life long learners will have even more choices from which to choose training, including creating their own.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>To this we can add self study and the rich experiences of participation and leadership in community activities.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Lifelong learners, therefore, can end up with a large number of certificates recognizing participation or achievement in individual courses but none which recognizes the continuous and collective achievement of the learner.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>While educational institutions may consider previous educational and other experience when accepting students, they are not very anxious to and less than generous in giving credit for education dissimilar to that which they offer in their own institution.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Some schools are even reluctant to give credit for courses taken through their own extension departments.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A sheepskin curtain separates credit and non credit courses.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Why shouldn’t learners be able to accumulate credits earned in school, university, college, at work, through self study, seminars, workshops, etc. and have these credits aggregated and counted towards an appropriate educational qualification?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Is it possible to do?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Difficult to administer?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Or do we lack the incentive or will?</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The idea of educational credit banks is not new.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The Open Learning Agency in BC operates such a scheme, however, it is limited to credits towards a university degree.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>New Zealand, on the other hand, has established a Qualification Authority that works with industry, education and training providers, and the community.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It operates in the area of post-compulsory education.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Its objective is “to simplify the current confusing system of qualifications and make it easier for people to continue learning”.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>England had its City and Guilds which are now being replaced with a competency based certification system.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Life experience is a more complex and difficult component to assess.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The notion of accepting life experience for educational credit has been around for several decades.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Attention to this facet of education in Canada is increasing and a number of Provinces have put or are putting a system in place.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My experience with Canadian efforts is limited.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The focus seems to be on converting life experience to a time based education credit (something like the Continuing Education Unit).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Time based credit is yesterday’s solution.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>New alternatives should be examined.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Canada could use an agency, which would not deliver training or education but would simply operate a credit bank.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>People of any age and in any Province could provide the bank with a record of their learning activities regardless of where and how they were obtained.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>On requires, and after assessment, the “bank” could issue the appropriate educational certificate for which a person is qualified.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Canada College could provide such a service.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Canada College could be constituted to issue a high school certificate, college diploma or a university degree or other educational credential.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They should be serious credentials; not of the mail order variety.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Canada College would receive, verify, assess, equate, aggregate, record, store, dispense and certify; it would not offer courses.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>A unique characteristic of Canada College would be its ability to assess non credit courses and life experiences and to convert them to educational credit.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A system of measuring performance would be required.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There is considerable experience available to draw from; however, considerable new ground must still be tilled.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Certification bodies provide one major source of expertise; CBE programs provide another.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>During the past three years I have built 2 bridges, swamped a road, installed a drainage system, supervised some road repair and road drainage, prepared bills of materials, and carried out the related business transactions.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Perhaps I’ll apply to Canada College to have this experience assessed for credit towards a civil engineering certificate or diploma.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I must prepare my portfolio.</p>
