  Governance Autonomy &amp; performance
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">&quot;Enabling Change in Education&quot; - Don&#x27;s newsletter piece analyzing the PEI Commission on School Governance report. Argues directly for school board autonomy based on OECD research showing positive correlation between autonomy and student performance. Advocates delegating operational responsibility to schools, with authority over hiring, budgeting, curriculum, and assessment. Cites Ron Renchler&#x27;s ERIC Digest on new governance patterns. Concludes each school board should operate with autonomy similar to private schools while accommodating all learners. Shows Don&#x27;s active engagement in PEI education policy discussions.

<p><b>Restructuring the School System</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>The recent report of the PEI Commission<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>on School Governance recommended<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>that much of the operational responsibility for schools be delegated to school Boards.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There are sound reasons for that recommendation.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Simply stated, there is a direct relationship between school performance and school autonomy.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In the words of the OECD Report (1911):</p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li7">“In countries where schools have greater autonomy over what is taught and how students<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
</ul>
<p>are assessed, students tend to perform better.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li7">In countries where schools account for their results by posting achievement data publicly, schools that enjoy greater autonomy in resource allocation tend to show better student performance than those with less autonomy.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li7">In countries where there are no such accountability arrangements, schools with greater autonomy in resource allocation tend to perform worse.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p>While the nature and extent of delegated roles varies by country, autonomy usually includes authority to hire and dismiss teachers, formulating and allocating budgets, allocating resources, making decisions about curricula and assessments, choosing textbooks, and deciding which courses to offer.</p>
<p>In an article on <span>New Patterns of School Governance </span><i>in </i>The ERIC Digest 141 - October 2000, Ron Renchler uggests that a system redesign include</p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li9">a focus on educational results rather than on the methods by which they were achieved,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li9">newly defined relationships with the general public and parents, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li9">a commitment on the part of the board to speak with one voice rather than as a group of individuals with individual agendas.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p>In general, the writer is of the view that each school Board should have the autonomy to operate a school or family of schools under its jurisdiction with the same freedom as a private school with the proviso that the school or system must accommodate all of learners in its district.</p>
