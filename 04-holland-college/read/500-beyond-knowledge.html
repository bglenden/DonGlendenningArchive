  500 Beyond Knowledge
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Don reflects on his journey toward competency-based education, tracing influences from S.R. Laycock&#x27;s learning models through his experience in vocational training and curriculum planning. He articulates the progression from traditional textbook-driven instruction to work-based, competency-focused approaches. Central to his vision is Benjamin Bloom&#x27;s taxonomy and his observation that public schools remain stuck at the comprehension level rather than advancing students through analysis, synthesis, and evaluation. Don argues that vocational programs excel precisely because they clearly define performance levels in workplace-relevant language, distinguishing them from academic programs.</div>

<p><b>Beyond Knowledge</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>In hindsight, I had been seeking a competency based approach to education for many years. Perhaps the stage was set by the learning model found in a text book by S. R. Laycock, a professor of Education at the University of Saskatchewan; his description of the learning process impressed me and stayed with me.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Later as my interests and studies moved beyond grades and subjects to education, the need for a more meaningful way to organize instruction became even more evident</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>In hindsight, stages or steps in my journey include:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Designing training programs, at least vocational ones, took me beyond textbooks and disciplines, and into the community and work place.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Text books come later, if at all.</p>
<p>Experience in vocational education where the first task of the teacher therefore is to find out what practitioners do, and then to prepare students to do likewise.</p>
<p>Detailed curriculum planning required to ensure that the training being offered addresses skills, knowledge and attitudes required for a chosen career.</p>
<p>My involvement in teacher education especially in the teaching of methods and curriculum development.</p>
<p>My exposure to discussions about nationwide standards so that skilled workers can meet qualifications required in any jurisdiction.</p>
<p>An introduction to programmed instruction or programmed learning in the 1960’s.</p>
<p>DACUM, the results of an occupational analysis presented on a single page<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>and used by learners and teachers alike as well as a basis for recording progress.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Then came the <span>Taxonomy of Learning</span><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>by Benjamin<span> </span>Bloom in which he not only identified three domains of learning, cognitive, affective and psychomotor, but also levels of learning for each domain.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>In the cognitive domain, the most often cited, Bloom identified six levels of learning with the lowest level being knowledge and the highest level being evaluation.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Students climb the ladder of learning starting with knowledge and work their way up through comprehension, application, analysis and synthesis to the highest level of learning, that of evaluation; there is no skipping of levels. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Unfortunately it seems, public schools are stuck on the first level, that of comprehension.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Perhaps it is a matter of reporting, or lack thereof.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I say that because my review of the literature has failed to uncover a community based description of levels.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>To wit, how do you define/describe an “A” in terms of performance.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>What performance can we expect for a student with an A that we should not expect from a student with a B?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I am sure that is taken into account in awarding grades but it is neither well stated nor understood.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>While some would argue that vocational programs are narrower in focus, there is no question in my mind, what is taught in a quality vocational program is taught at a higher level.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The description of levels of performance is one of the criteria that differentiates vocational programs from others in that each level is described in terms similar to those used for an employee in the workplace.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In fact, in my view, the distinguishing characteristic of vocational programs is the description of rating levels and has little if anything to do with content.</p>
