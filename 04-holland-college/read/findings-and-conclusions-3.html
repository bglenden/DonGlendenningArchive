  Findings and conclusions 3
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">November 2024 conclusions on PEI education system written by Don after extensive reading and conversations. Key findings: PEI has a school system not education system; Department of Education lacks education definition; government confuses curriculum delivery with helping people learn; needs increased transparency and collaboration. Document shows Don remained actively engaged with education analysis until end of life, addressing persistent systemic issues from his perspective as founding Holland College president.</div>
