<p><b>Inquiry/Exploratory Request</b></p>
<p><b>Student Achievement Levels</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>BACKGROUND</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Mission/purpose of organization:<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span></b>Education 20/20 Inc. is a federally incorporated independent, broad based, national, not-for-profit education organization, located in Charlottetown, PEI and is governed by a volunteer Board of Directors.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Our mission is to encourage and support a quality education for every Canadian; Education 20/20 Inc. is unique among educational organizations in Canada in that it is unaligned with any educational institutions, grade level, subject field or cause. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The organization operates with ten Directors, a network of some sixty people, and a mailing list of almost 300.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Enclosed is a list of activities by year since our incorporation.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Although most Directors have participated in externally funded projects in their other roles, this is the first such project for Education 20/20 Inc. and certainly our first request for funding from the Windsor Foundation.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Proposal – </b>to develop outcomes based model for establishing education levels in the public school system.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Issue being addressed</b></p>
<p>The current approach to grading students raises three issues:</p>
<p>Should there be recognized levels of achievement in school subjects?</p>
<p>If so, who should set such levels?</p>
<p>Who should determine the level that ah individual has attained?</p>
<p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><b>Relationship to Windsor Foundation Priorities</b><b></b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>This project is at the root of improving the quality of education and actually addresses both major interests of the Windsor Foundation. The amount and quality of education will continue to be major determinants of our individual and collective futures.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is recognized that raising levels of education by even one grade will have a significant impact on both an individual and a country’s future; the EU says by 6 percent on the first year and three percent in the longer term.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Most efforts to improve education, it seems, are focused on schools, new technology, increased engagement, better qualified teachers and project based learning.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We would argue that greater attention should also be given to what gets measured, how, when, by whom and how well the results are communicated.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Clearly identified levels, especially in basic skills (mathematics, communications, science, personal management and IT) should be part of the improvement process.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>To deal with the issue of standards, many countries have developed qualification authorities with a focus on better coordination of inputs, (course content, level, prerequisites, time, etc.).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Our proposal calls for a different approach, that of measuring and reporting what has been learned – levels of achievement reached.,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>PROJECT NARRATIVE</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>Following the publication of a survey of Island youth in late 2013 (CFPEI, <span>Vital Signs</span>, 2013), Education 20/20 organized public discussions for the purpose of informing the community of the report and its findings, learning more about youth issues, exploring issues of education and learning, and to identify actions to be taken.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Discussions were lively and wide ranging, and carried on well after the formal session ended. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Since then Education 20/20 has continued its exploration, both formally and informally, with postsecondary institutions, employers, teachers and education officials and concluded that:</p>
<p>The current school grading system does not adequately describe a person’s level of achievement</p>
<p>The use of “Grade” to designate both age and achievement level is confusing and misleading.</p>
<p>Levels of achievement should be determined by an independent body and not by teachers.</p>
<p>Traditional assessment practices are not adequate for measuring achievement levels</p>
<p>Outcomes based education calls for externally referenced criteria for assessment and grading. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The large number of teacher empowered to “grade” students contributes to the inconsistency of school grades</p>
<p>Those who teach should not sort.</p>
<p>The growing use of social promotion creates uncertainty about the value of school based grades as measures of achievement.</p>
<p>Increasingly, it appears, report cards fail to differentiate levels of achievement.</p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Proposal </b>– using mathematics as a pilot, Education 20/20 Inc. proposes to develop a framework for determining achievement levels based on outcomes.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>The challenge</b></p>
<p>Outcome Based Education has been around in Canada from 50 to sixty years.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>During this time, the public school system has developed its own brand, Curriculum Based Outcomes. The challenge will be to find an assessment model that is compatible with an outcome base.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Work plan:</b></p>
<p>The project breaks new ground and is heavy on information gathering, consultation and idea generation:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Establish project Committee – </b>the following people are committed to serving on a steering committee: The President of The Community Foundation of Prince Edward Island, Associate Dean of the new School of Mathematics at UPEI. A successful Island entrepreneur, and myself, the Founding President of Holland College.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Gather background information – </b>Gather information about outcomes, assessment, benchmarks and achievement levels from local institutions and contacts, Western and Northern Canada Protocol, Ontario Qualification Framework, Qualification Authorities (Australia and New Zealand), PISA, P-CAP, and others</p>
<p><b>Adopt an outcome base - </b>from the above literature search, we expect to find competencies of sufficient range and in a sufficient number to form the basis of the project but will modify as needed<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><b>Develop a competency based rating scale – </b>as far as we know, this step is absolutely groundbreaking in the education system.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><b>Identify achievement levels – </b>the usual procedure is to cluster outcomes around age levels of students; we propose, instead, to seek out natural groupings within subject areas and to recognize the level of achievement regardless of age.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>While their approaches differ from our proposal, we plan to take advantage of the work of the Ontario Qualification Authority and the Western and Northern Canada Protocol<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><b>Testing – </b>the testing protocol is yet to be determined.</p>
<p><b>Prepare final report</b><b></b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Financial:</b><b></b></p>
<p>Admin support person – 125 hr. x $30 = 	$3,750</p>
<p>Materials and supplies –(1)			$2,000</p>
<p>Facilitators					$4,000</p>
<p>Meeting costs				$1,800</p>
<p>Testing<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>(2)					$2,500</p>
<p>Admin					$1,500</p>
<p><span><b>TOTAL <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>$15,550<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></span></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Innovative and beneficial features:</b></p>
<p>A single analysis of a subject available to all educational institutions<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Provides the same view of the subject for all users, teachers, students, parents, examiners, employers and parents.</p>
<p>Improves capability for tracking student learning</p>
<p>Allows for identification of a variety of profiles drawn from the same analysis<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Supports independent study</p>
<p>Bridges institutional and employer needs</p>
<p>Encourages communication and teamwork<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Allows learners to situate their learning in the context of the larger field<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>TIMELINES: </b>Commence immediately on approval and finish by end of month five.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>VOLUNTEER HOURS: 	</b>An estimated 236 person/hours of community volunteers<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>(Not directors or members of Education 20/20 Inc.)</p>
<p><b>NOTES:</b></p>
<p>Although this may seem heavy, we plan to display complete analyses on large sheets of paper which will likely require some commercial graphics and printing.</p>
<p>The testing protocol is to be determined</p>
