  Standards (3)
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">(172 words):** Don establishes rigorous standards framework distinguishing performance standards from educational qualifications. Standards must be community-reflective, observable, credible, attainable, and measurable. Critically, standards require both criteria and hierarchical performance levels. Don uses writing assessment to demonstrate: &quot;time&quot; becomes meaningful only as segmented benchmarks (75, 100, 125 units daily) with corresponding proficiency ratings. Benchmarks anchor standards to real-world practice—reading proficiency equates to local newspaper comprehension. Don argues schools maintain artificially separate standards from workplaces, disadvantaging students by teaching to different benchmarks than they&#x27;ll encounter professionally. He advocates aligning school writing standards to workplace writing standards, emphasizing consistent performance criteria across contexts. This framework influenced Holland College&#x27;s outcomes-based approach and Don&#x27;s systematic educational reform philosophy.</div>

<p>17 – Relevant Standards</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Everyone seems to have a c~t: favourite story about school standards e pecially as they relate to reading, writing, geography, Canadian History and work habits. It has ever been thus; criticisms go back at least to the time of the Greeks but that is not to say that the issue should be 'ignored." Furthermore, we frequently confuse standards and certification, and probably qualifications as well.</p>
<p>A standard is not a qualification although a qualification should be based on a standard.</p>
<p>Being a high school, college or university graduate is not, in my view a standard. They, however, be considered an educational qualification. So just what is a standard?</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>t 'if</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Although I browsed a number of publications, the definitions I found were, in my view, incomplete. A couple of definitions referred to any "criterion on which things are judged." I also found a number of references to national standards, academic standards, program standards and occupational standards. These are fine but I wanted a more basic definition. So I decided to create my own.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>A standard is a level of performance of a service or product. Educational standards are performance standards and should:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>· Reflect practices in the community they serve. " · Are based on observable performance, · Should be credible to the receiving community. c · May include levels other than the required level.</p>
<p>· Are attainable.</p>
<p>· Are measurable.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>An educational standard is incomplete without having both criteria and levels of performance. For example, although time to complete a task could be a criterion on which a person is rated. This may be stated in terms of units per hour or per day that a person produces. A person who produces 100 units per day would receive one rating, a person who produces 125 units per day would receive a higher rating and a person who produces 75 units per day would receive a different rating. Speed I a criterion but needs to be further segmented to show levels of speed.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>We also need benchmarks. In the construction trade, for example, there are figures for how many bricks per day is expected of masons, how many shingle per day is expected of roofers, and similar measures are available for other tasks within the field. Simply put, a benchmark is a level of performance which is widely recognized by practitioners and which serves as the reference point. A benchmark anchors a standard in reality.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Levels of performance in school seldom bear any resemblance to those in later life; for the most part, they don't But I believe that they should. In my view ratings given in school or university, especially those in the higher grades, should be on the same skills, using the same criteria and the same benchmarks as in later life. Anything else does a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>disservice to our students. As an example, levels of performance in writing should be the same for the same performance whether the person is in school, college, university, at home or at work. It is time to dispense with one set of standards for people in school and another in the world of work.</p>

<p>5 Very well organized showing precise and wide vocabulary, good sentence structure and appropriate grammar and some creativity.</p>

<p>4 Organized with few errors in grammar and sentence structure</p>
