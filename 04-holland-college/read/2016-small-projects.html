<p>After our annual meeting concluded last Wednesday, we spoke about potential funding for small projects, the example was a possible project in Eastern PEI, perhaps the Souris Area, in the range of $2-5.000. Here is a summary of responses to date:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li5">Book Club for Kids</li>
</ul>
<p>A reading club for kids and their parents; New York Times of July 24, 2016</p>

<p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li5">Education Navigator To provide young people, and their parents, with an advisor/navigator to help with the decision-making process about their educational future; one such model is that put in place recently at Westside High School in Vancouver.</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li9">Encouraging Literacy</li>

  <li class="li11">Conduct parent training programs, programs usually run for___ hours per week for<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>8 weeks;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li12">Add a “kids book club” component to run concurrently with the adult program we could encourage literacy through the reading club and for younger children a love of reading through stories and art of various kinds.</li>
  <li class="li12">Three parent programs -east, central and west; If we had 3 pilot programs running for  parents and children simultaneously with (<span>$2,500.00)</span> funding for each would enable an honorarium for each facilitator as well as cover the cost of materials and supplies for each program .<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Seek community support for snacks for parents and children.</li>
</ul>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li13">Technology</li>

<p>An afterschool program to provide students in Grades program to provide students in the Grades 7-9 age group with opportunities to work with electronics, learn Scratch programming, learn and experiment with 3D design; students meet in the computer lab at a local school for 1.5 hours once a week for 6 week; students are also expected to tour the FabLab at new Engineering building at UPEI, and have their 3D designs painted.<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>1. It depends how many computers we have access to. 20 is a comfortable group size. 1.5 hour a week for 6 weeks. Normally, $2000, but I would say $2500 to help cover the cost of transportation to UPEI.</p>
<ul class="ul1">

</ul>
<p>A March Break style camp or after-school program for Grade 10-12 modelled on the UPEI 1st year design course.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Students could work with people in the community to design and prototype a device that would help them solve a problem and present their solutions to the public..<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Support would be required through the design and prototype stages as well as access to the FabLab at UPEI, high school shops (welding, carpentry, etc) and possibly local businesses.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
