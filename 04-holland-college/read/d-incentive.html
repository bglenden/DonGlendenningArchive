</div>

<div class="reader-summary">2008 proposal for an Educational Incentive Fund to drive systemic education change. Don identifies structural weaknesses including accountability dispersal, rising costs without productivity gains, discipline-based content delivery, vague standards, and lost flexibility. Proposes a fund encouraging schools to innovate with outcomes-based approaches, staffing flexibility, and cost accountability. Management involves the Community Foundation of PEI, private sector advisors, and education professionals. Includes Don&#x27;s biographical summary highlighting his background as Founding President of Holland College, educational consultant, and international development expert with projects across Africa and Asia.</div>

<p><span><b>IMPROVEMENT INCENTIVE FUND</b></span></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>A Draft Proposal</b><b></b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>BACKGROUND:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Education is under considerable scrutiny and pressure to reform. Some of the criticism is valid; some is not. Provincial governments have responded in a number of ways including<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>restructuring school boards, lengthening the school day, encouraging charter schools, increasing teacher qualifications, specifying learning outcomes, introducing external examinations and providing teacher aides. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>These changes should help but some structural changes are also needed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is unlikely that the required changes will come from within the system; an external change agent is needed. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>FOCUS OF THIS INITIATIVE<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>This proposal focuses on the following:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Accountability</b> that is widely dispersed</p>
<p><b>Costs </b>that rise without reference to productivity<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><b>Content </b>drawn from disciplines instead of life<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><b>Standards</b> without definition<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></p>
<p><b>Flexibility</b> lost to administrative<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>convenience</p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>The instruments of change include:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Choice</b> on the part of learners</p>
<p><b>Teaching/learning </b>models</p>
<p><b>Staffing</b> patterns</p>
<p><b>Cost</b> centered accounting</p>
<p><b>Standards</b> of performance</p>
<p><b>Responsiveness</b> to individual interests and needs<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>CONCEPT:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The idea involves establishing an Educational Incentive Fund for the purpose of encouraging and supporting changes as identified in the previous section of this paper. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Following the announcement of the Fund:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Schools will be invited to submit a preliminary proposal endorsed by the School Board</p>
<p>External assessor(s) will undertake a detailed review with the school of the operational context of the intervention</p>
<p>The school revises their proposal as required</p>
<p>The school and the Fund enter into a contractual agreement identifying timelines and dates and conditions for the release of funds</p>
<p>Quarterly progress<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>reports will be provided and each project wil under go a major annual review before authorizing further payments.</p>
<p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><b>PROJECT MANAGEMENT</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The management structure of the project is yet to be determined, however, it is anticipated that the following stakeholders will be key to minimizing bureaucracy and administrative costs:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span>The Community Foundation of Prince Edward Island</span> is viewed as an appropriate host providing administrative support and taking advantage of their grant-making experience.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span>A Private Sector</span><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>group will help keep the focus on administrative practices<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span>Professional Educators</span> will be needed, both volunteer and paid, to assist in the design and assessment of proposals and the evaluation of performance</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>ESTIMATED COST</b><b></b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Not yet determined</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>NEXT STEPS</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>This is a concept not a proposal and the writer is interested in working with a partner to help shape a proposal as well as provide funding.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The next logical steps would be to:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Enter<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>into discussions with interested potential funder(s), and</p>
<p>Develop a more detailed proposal or perhaps a feasibility study</p>
<p><br></p>
