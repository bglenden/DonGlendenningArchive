<p>Auditorium</p>
<p>First time I spoke to a group in the west</p>
<p>Honour of your visit – holding gathering in the auditorium</p>
<p>Obviously delighted</p>
<p>Mentioned it to my boss when I returned</p>
<p>Boss pointed out the origin of auditorium</p>
<p>Audio-to hear; Taurus – the bull</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Confession</p>
<p>Taught for many years before I began to understand what teaching and learning was all about</p>
<p>It came as I was preparing to teach teachers</p>
<p>A little Book called Teaching and learning</p>
<p>By S. T Laycock, Saskatchewan</p>
<p>It included some diagrams of the interaction</p>
<p>And he talked about homeostasis</p>
<p>And motivation – throwing the learner off balance</p>
<p>It certainly had an effect on me</p>
<p>Homeostasis – key to motivation</p>
<p>Teaching and learning</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Heart of teaching learning process</p>
<p>Teaching is helping a learner learn – change behaviour</p>
<p>Behaviour is observable</p>
<p>A change in behaviour is observable</p>
<p>That’s what you focus on</p>
<p>Teacher for a number of years before I began to understand what learning and teaching</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Ross Ford</p>
<p>Ray Parent – kind of administrator that helps you</p>
<p>Cannot do that – Act won’t allow</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Holland College – a chance to put it together</p>
<p>Putting what I believed into practice</p>
<p>Blank sheet of paper</p>
<p>Postsecondary alternative to university education</p>
<p>Set of beliefs</p>
<p>No past, only a future</p>
<p>The challenge of the day, at least as I saw it, was to design a flexible system that would allow the College to provide a high quality education in a timely manner</p>
<p>Until then educators preached individualizing but practiced<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>batch processing. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Developed set of principles</p>
<p>It does work, can work</p>
<p>Saved some students equivalent of one semester</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>DACUM – permanently changed the way I think</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Standards -issues of the day</p>
<p>Clearly stated outcomes or competencies</p>
<p>Criteria</p>
<p>Rating scale</p>
<p>Benchmark</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Advice</p>
<p>You’ve changed roles – you are a teacher</p>
<p>Keep eating sandwiches</p>
<p>Engage in discussion about teaching and learning with colleagues and through your professional organization<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Read but not to the exclusion of thinking</p>
<p>Write – great way to clarify your thinking</p>
