<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li16">I came to computer to send agenda when I found your notes; this note willbecome our new agenda</li>
  <li class="li16">Sorry that I cannot reschedule either but I have another commitment on Friday.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li16">Suggest that Alice and I meet on Thursday morning at 9:30 at Cancer Society board room as planned especially to flesh out plans for December 4 – SD attached</li>
  <li class="li16">Our “advisors” strongly recommended that we move forward on a school award. Attached is a copy of notes made from clippings, etc. in my files. It is not a proposal or plan but I thought it would provide useful background information. I’d like to have at least a preliminary discussion especially around the matter of how we handle initiatives. – SD attached</li>
  <li class="li16">I am assuming that we will strike a committee/team to develop and steer each major initiative. If so, we need to discuss committee representation meaning public, parent, educator, student, etc. We do not have many respurces so we need to keep the process simple.</li>
  <li class="li16">There were some other items but I’ve pulled them from the agenda for the moment.<span><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></li>
  <li class="li16">We also should discuss a meeting schedule, at least from not until Christmas.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sorry we cannot accommodate you plans, Eileen; please share any information, views and ideas about any and all of the above; I’ll try to take more formal notes. At our last meeting, Eileen, you mentioned serving on an “awards committee”. Any chance that you’d have terms of reference?</p>
<p>Thanks and regards</p>
