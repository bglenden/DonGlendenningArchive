<p>		INTRODUCTION</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The focus of this paper is to identify critical issues in secondary education, and to propose strategies for addressing the issues.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The issues are those which have emerged out of the social and economic changes which have been impacting our nation during the past quarter century and which will continue to influence the direction of secondary education up to the year 2000 and beyond.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Over the past decade, virtually every province has conducted a review and assessment of its secondary school program.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The methodology used by the reviewers was largely survey in nature.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>These surveys relied on judgements expressed by the general population to form their conclusions and recommendations.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The grassroots reactions were ascertained by questionnaires, opinionnaires, public meetings, briefs and, in some cases, visits to selected schools.<sup>1</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup><br></p>
<p>The reviews are generally cloaked in language that has emotional meaning, but the message has little descriptive content.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Words such as "develop", "respect", or "enhance" are frequently used in recommendations or in statements of educational goals.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Although the provincial reports offer little by way of clear direction for high schools, they provide a useful backdrop for examining critical issues in secondary education.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>One primary concern that did emerge from the reviews related to the need to adjust secondary schools to meet the economic realities of our time and to come to grips with the changes being introduced into society and technology.<sup>2</sup><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is in this context that our paper is written.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>	ASSUMPTIONS</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The following assumptions about secondary education serve as the basis for identifying critical issues.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Assumption #1:<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><span>That Canada's future economic prosperity and standard of living, will be determined in large measure by the degree to which its educational system develops the nation's human resources, thus enabling it to compete successfully in the global economy.</span></p>
<p><span></span><br></p>
<p>This assumption reflects the reality that during the past thirty years, Canada has been undergoing a transition from a resource-based to a knowledge-based economy.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In 1963, resources accounted for 40% of our exports, but by 1987, this dropped to 22%.<sup>3</sup><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>During the resource-based era, Canada enjoyed a natural advantage in world markets because of the rich supply of natural resources.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>But since the early 1980's, our resource industries have faced increased competition from other countries.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Consequently, Canada's trade now relies on the export of manufactured goods, with many Canadian manufacturers shifting production towards higher value-added, specialized and information-based products <sup>4</sup>.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Such production calls for a highly skilled, well educated, knowledgeable workforce.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Increasingly, knowledge is the key factor in our country's international economic strength.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There is a close correlation between the ability of an economy to grow and compete in the world today and the rate of increase of its population in school beyond age fifteen.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Thus development of human resources has become a national imperative.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Failure to develop these resources will not only stymie economic growth, but will result in unacceptably high levels of unemployment requiring costly social support systems that our traditional structures will be unable to afford.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Serious social unrest could be the result.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Secondary schools are key players in the drive to more fully develop our human resources.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In this context, the appropriateness of the curriculum must be questioned.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Furthermore, the national secondary school drop-out rate which hovers about 28 percent represents the loss of a potential resource that must be recovered.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Assumption # 2:<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><span>That rapid technological change will continue to impact on the world of work and on our secondary schools for the foreseeable future.</span></p>
<p><span></span><br></p>
<p>This assumption focuses on the dynamic nature of our economy and of its impact on secondary education.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It calls for a flexible mind-set on the part of individuals and institutions and a capacity to adapt to constant change.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Peter Drucker had recognized this reality over twenty years ago when he exhorted businesses, government, and educational institutions to learn to put the future ahead of yesterday - in their policies, in their attitudes, in their organization and structure.</p>
<p></p>
<p>"In a period of continuity, yesterday could be expected to stay around for the morrow.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>To strengthen yesterday was therefore likely to strengthen tomorrow.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In a period of change, and especially of rapid technological change in which new industries will appear as the economic leaders, to strengthen yesterday weakens tomorrow".<sup>5</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup><br></p>
<p>What are the expectations for education?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Well, as manufacturing firms introduce process automation at an increasing rate, production workers will need to develop basic functional skills such as improved literacy and numeracy to operate computer-based equipment.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In Japan where process automation is widely used, an increasing proportion of production jobs call for college graduates or, at a minimum, secondary school graduates with a sound knowledge of science and mathematics.<sup>6</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup><br></p>
<p>In some automated industries, individual workers may be called upon to schedule production runs, conduct quality control inspections, set up and repair equipment, and more - depending on the specific needs of the time<sup>7</sup>.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This approach requires greater analytical, problem-solving, communication and interpersonal skills on the part of workers.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Assumption # 3 - <span>That secondary education should operate to serve the needs of all youth in the age bracket normally accommodated in Grades 10 through 12</span>.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>As a reaction to the class barriers found in secondary schools in Europe of the last century, Canada's high schools became egalitarian in nature, and theoretically, at least, were to be accessible to all regardless of the wealth or social position of parents.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>"Nothing could erode class barriers faster than the 'little red school house'.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Schools in Canada, much sooner than their counterparts in France and Britain, became schools of the people 'for every man's son'.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This is particularly noticeable in the development of secondary education".<sup>8</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup><br></p>
<p>While secondary schools in this country are now generally accessible to virtually all high school age students, there remains a question of the appropriateness of the curriculum.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In particular, "how well does it meet the diversified educational needs of the students?"<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Although only about one-third of Canadians ever study in post secondary institutions, the high school curriculum is largely academic in nature and is dominated by university preparatory courses.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Some students who view such a program as irrelevant are among the school drop-outs.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Until a few years ago, however, our secondary schools seemed to be moving towards a more "liberal" education:<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>a wider choice of courses, a greater flexibility of curricula, new teaching methods and de-emphasis of formal exams were the norm.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But recent public hearings and reviews of education suggest that the results of that trend are now widely perceived as undesirable.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Nevertheless, while Canadians seem to favour a more structured educational format, they also show considerable ambivalence about whether curriculum changes should emphasize a "back-to-basic" approach or place greater emphasis on direct preparation for the labour force.<sup>9</sup><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Thus 59 percent of a sample of Canadians polled in one survey opted for a "back-to-basics" program, while 73 percent of respondents in another survey conducted by the same firm in the same year, agreed that the education system places too much emphasis on purely academic education.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The challenge is to develop a secondary education system that achieves an integration of basic education, personal development and preparation for participation in the labour force.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Surrounding the whole matter of secondary education, there exists a number of areas for which further study is needed:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>•Graduation requirements in terms of the goals of students.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>•Systems of grading (marking) and promotion.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>•Reduction of grades or loss of a credit because of missed days.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>•Definition of graduation requirements in terms of skills or competencies to be demonstrated.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Attempts to change the nature and structure of secondary schools in any radical way, face two major constraints:<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Teachers, for the most part are products of traditional systems and as a result are uncomfortable with approaches which are foreign to them.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Likewise, parents tend to expect schools to offer the kind of education to which they can relate and in which they can become involved with their children.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Furthermore, the organizational structure itself has become inflexible and stagnant.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But it is interesting to note that the importance of education is being supported by organizations which are relatively new to the scene, are not primarily composed of professional educators, or have recently become aware of the education factor in Canadian economic and social life.</p>
<p></p>
<p>	SOME CRITICAL ISSUES</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>When one examines secondary education in the light of a knowledge-based economy and one that is being impacted by rapid technological change and to which the school program must respond, there emerges a series of critical issues.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We're attempting to identify the issues which are most pressing but which might be resolved in a way that could impact positively on education.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They are not presented in any order of priority.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The Issue of the Application of The New Information Technology in Secondary Schools<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Technologies in most Canadian High Schools have not kept pace with the technologies used in the larger society.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In fact, schools today, more than most other institutions, reflect their 19th century technological roots.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Lectures, tracking, textbooks, field trips, chalkboards, courses, credits, busing, and the like remain the technologies of choice.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This is not to say that computer technology has not made some impact on schools.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But its application has been largely administrative in nature.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Secondary schools now use computers to take care of attendance records, bus scheduling, scoring, and processing of test scores, grade reporting, registration, scheduling, fiscal accounting, preparation of class lists, and numerous other clerical tasks.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>But in most schools student "hands on" contact with computers tend to be confined to elective courses in computer literacy and data processing, or through utilization of computerized guidance services such as CHOICES.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But even in these situations, the contact may be limited.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In one study conducted by the Ontario Secondary School Teachers' Federation, many students who were interviewed were unaware that their schools had computerized guidance services.<sup>10</sup><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Effective communication between the individual student and the highly compartmentalized secondary education institution is a serious problem.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>There is little evidence to suggest that most schools have moved beyond teaching students the technical details <span>about</span> computers, e.g. keyboard, computer literacy and programming.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A higher level of applications is achieved through the direct application of information technology to the curriculum through computer-assisted instruction (CAI).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This application has the potential to permit students to learn at an individual pace.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But to date, this approach has found a limited application.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In fact, there is evidence to suggest that it used most often by special education teachers for remedial work.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In the recent past, the cost of hardware, together with the inappropriateness of much of the software have served to restrict this application.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>But the situation is changing.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Computer assisted instruction is now available for a vast range of subjects.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Some on-line services provide data bases of information (encyclopedias, for example) plus a considerable number of subject-based, skill-based programs.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Students can work individually at their own speed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Advanced students may use programs on subjects at any level.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Slower students are comfortable with the anonymity and "objectivity" of CAI.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>CAI<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>can also be used in networks - in a class, school, area, etc.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Instructors can monitor a number of terminals, help students individually, display selected examples on every screen, anonymously, and seek for cooperative editing, for example.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The highest level and the most promising in the application of information technology to education is that of learning <span>with computers</span>.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Through this application schools have the capacity to access remote data bases as sources of information, or go "on-line" with other schools or other educational institutions across the country or around the world.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In this context, there is the example of a school in Foxboro, Massachuesetts going on-line with a school in Kindersley, Saskatchewan and saying much more than "hello".<sup>11</sup><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The messages and replies were transmitted instantly from computer to computer.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Students learned about another country just as they could have through the mail.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>It is increasingly essential that everyone - students and teachers - get information from on-line data bases, CD-ROM's, video disks, information networks, etc.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Students need to practice both getting the information and using it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>An on-line data base like <span>Informart</span>, for example, can provide full text daily of ten Canadian newspapers, Maclean's, and news services.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is relatively inexpensive, can provide practice in using data bases and can be used for obtaining up-to-date information on nearly all of the subjects taught in school.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It can also be used to compare accounts of the same issue, event, or game, across the country.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span>Microlog</span> would also be useful because the information is Canadian and most of it is available quickly and cheaply on microfiche.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>CD ROM's like that of the <span>Readers' Guide</span> may be useful for schools near major libraries, but they are likely to be frustrating for most students in Canada.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The contemporary secondary educational institution reflects contemporary society in suffering from the effects of over specialization and individual isolation.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We conclude a discussion of this issue with the following observations:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>•The rapidly decreasing cost of electronic networking, teleconferencing, and computer conferencing, combined with CD-ROM and videodisc technology makes it possible to overcome many of the disadvantages of schools in remote areas and of individuals learning through distance education.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>•Although some educators may have to be dragged kicking and screaming into the telecommunication revolution, it is essential that secondary schools get on board.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is projected that by the year 2000, using remote databases will be a mandatory skill for every student.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>•Computers should be considered a school-wide resource to be used across all subject areas and support services.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>•Integration of new technologies into school programs should be carried out in conjunction with local units of the teachers' organization, school boards, universities and colleges, and with Business and Industry.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>•A variety of professional development opportunities should be provided to assist teachers at different levels of technology use in developing practices that utilize new technologies.<sup>12</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup><br></p>
<p><sup></sup><br></p>
<p>The Issue Related to The Preparation of Teachers in the Information Age</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>There is considerable evidence that teacher education programs are not preparing candidates to adequately cope with the expectations and demands of teaching at the secondary school level.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Although pre-service training opportunities in computer applications for new teachers are improving, there remains a significant number of training institutions which offer little or nothing in this area.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Student teachers should be comfortable with using computers for CAI, and be capable of accessing remote data bases as sources of information.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Such strategies should be incorporated into at least some of the education courses.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is imperative that all teachers at the pre-service level be provided with this training.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Poorly trained teachers who lack confidence in their abilities to make use of the new technology or who feel that the technology is nothing more than a nuisance may communicate negative attitudes to their students.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Such teachers may also become defensive or derisive about students' interest in using the technology.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The importance of the teacher as a mentor and role model needs to be rediscovered and reemphasized.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>In addition to the limitations found in some pre-service programs, the matter of in-service training is of equal or greater concern.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In many school districts, there is no coordinated plan for the introduction of new technology.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In some situations the integration of computers into the curriculum has been left to the personal initiative of teachers.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In-service offerings are limited, and in some cases, teachers are not participating. <sup>13</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup><br></p>
<p>The issue of teacher education should be addressed, not only in terms of the new technology, but also in terms of other expectations and realities of working in secondary schools in the 1990's.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In this context, the following observations are offered:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>•Many teachers, principals and counsellors are not prepared to teach and guide at-risk students; therefore continuous and relevant staff development must be provided. <sup>14</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup><br></p>
<p>•In-service programs should be focused (thematic) and sustained.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>One-shot sessions are of little value.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>•School-based in-service activities have been found to be the most effective way to achieve greater application of a strategy in the classroom.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>School-based in-service activities using the buddy system for support have been found to be the most effective way to achieve greater application of a strategy in the classroom.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The individual teacher needs support from colleagues.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>•Teacher organizations, school boards, and employers should cooperate more frequently in the professional development activities.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A service oriented, clearing house type of structure with much flexibility needs to be developed allowing the different stake holders to work together on a professional level.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>•Applied aspects of teacher education at the pre-service level would appear to need greater attention as well as the phased initiation of the beginning teacher to the classroom.</p>
<p></p>
<p>•In recent years, teacher education programs have become more exclusive at the entry level.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Some of the brightest students in university now enrol in the programs.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This trend ultimately may have a negative impact on the ability of schools to meet the needs of students at risk.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>On the other hand, teacher education programs are accommodating larger number of mature students who bring broader experience to the classroom than would their counterparts.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>•The pre-service programs, in general, do not give sufficient attention to the teacher as a manager of learning.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As computers assume a more prominent role in the instructional process, the teacher will function more as a facilitator of learning than as a transmitter of information by coordinating the kinds of learning resources available, and deciding which procedures, approaches, and materials will be most effective for students with various learning needs.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>•Preparation of teachers should be based on the needs of students, namely communication skills, numeracy skills, interpersonal skills and the ability to view learning as continuous.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>•The concept of competency based teacher education should be examined and given experimental application.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>•Teacher Preparation Programs should receive more feedback from new teachers.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Such feedback could be provided by the teachers themselves, by the school, or the school board.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The Issue of Accountability</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Addressing the issue of accountability in a decentralized and multifaceted education system is a formidable task.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Since education is a provincial matter, the creation of national indicators or standards is very difficult.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Furthermore, the demise of provincial exmainations has allowed individual school districts within a province to exercise a fair degree of latitude with respect to the manner in which programs are organized and delivered.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In addition, courses which are locally developed and designed to meet local needs are found in many high schools.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As a consequence, accountability is diffused across the entire system.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There is accountability at the provincial level.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Governments continue to conduct reviews to obtain a reading or "measure" of public satisfaction with education.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Likewise, school boards carry out surveys to secure the views of constituents regarding the perceived effectiveness of its schools.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>At the school level, the principal and teachers are held accountable for the performance of students.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Such accountability usually takes the form of written tests and exmainations, with the occasional injection of standardized tests.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Given the structure and nature of the Canadian school system, this pattern is likely to continue for the foreseeable future.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>However, accountability in its present form is somewhat deficient.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>•Global, long-term goals are a source of guilt rather than a direction.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Appreciation of literature is a desirable goal; but how is the degree of student attainment of the goal measured?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Frequently, there is little relationship between the goals of education and the assessment which follows.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>To the degree that the curriculum (content and process) does not relate its components to the stated goals, then the accountability is not well defined.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>•It is time for some fundamental rethinking about the requirements to be met by students in order to receive a high school certificate or diploma.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Current graduation requirements are not very meaningful and perpetuate a myth that needs to be exposed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"What evidence do we have that a particular set of courses help students achieve their objectives?"<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"What is the relationship between the pattern of courses required for high school graduation and later success in income-generating employment?"</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>•Schools must be accountable for all students - including drop-outs.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The principal must be made aware of what he/she is accountable for.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"If any student disappears, does the principal have to provide an explanation?"</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>•Accountability in terms of evaluative feedback and follow-up must be given greater emphasis.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is important to track students as they move from school to school, or from secondary school to a post secondary education, or from school to employment, or indeed from school to the "street".<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Is this not a matter of accountability?</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>•There is evidence that feedback of information through follow-up of students can contribute to professional growth of staff members as they address such questions as:<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"What is the impact of what we are doing?" "Where can we improve"?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"Where have we no control?"</p>
<p>The Issue of Leadership at the School Level</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Research into the management of education has identified the principal as the key figure in determining the effectiveness of a school.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As instructional leader, he/she articulates the school's vision, shapes a climate which fosters learning, orchestrates curriculum changes and innovations, and in general, is the driving force within the school.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In addition, he/she is responsible for management of the budget, the physical plant, and the non-instructional personnel.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In view of the fact that the role of the principal is so pivotal, the following observations are offered:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>•In several provinces, no well defined process exists for the identification and preparation of candidates for the principalship.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Some "fall" into the role as a result of having been a successful teacher.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>•In some schools, the principal immerses themselves in managerial tasks to the neglect of their role as instructional leaders.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Computerization of many of the clerical and management-related tasks should allow the principal to devote more time to the program of instruction.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The manager/leader dichotomy of the principal role clearly needs to be addressed.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>•The essential elements of educational leadership at the secondary school level should be identified.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This should also include an identification of the management skills required of school administrators.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>•There is need for continuing education programs for principals.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In some cases, the principal might participate in management training programs sponsored by business and industry.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>•There should be more opportunity for principals to meet on a national level - possibly through leadership institutes sponsored by a national organization, such as the Canadian Association of Principals (CAP); the Canadian Teachers Federation (CTF); Canadian Education Association (CEA); Canadian Association of School Administration (CASA), etc.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>•The role of a high school principal has been identified as one of the most demanding and stress-filled positions in the education system.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Some school boards are encountering difficulties in securing suitable candidates willing to take on the task.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The Issue of the Poorly Served Students</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The fact that approximately 30 percent of young people drop out of high school before graduation is a matter of concern.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Much has been written about this problem so it will not receive specific attention here<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>other than to mention some of the intervention strategies which have been somewhat promising. In addition to the drop-outs who have left school, there are "drop-outs" who are still in school but for whom the program is deficient - at least to some degree.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Included in this latter group are certain of the super-bright or gifted, students of marginal academic ability, native students, children whose native language is other than English or French, kids in conflict with the law, children from economically deprived homes, Educationally Behaviourially Disturbed (EBD) students, and those who attend in body but not in spirit.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Fundamental to serving these groups is the acceptance by local school authorities of their responsibility for educating all youth of their district.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Related to this issue are the following factors:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>•Partially as a result of Human Rights Legislation, secondary schools must be accessible to all students of high school age - including those with multiple handicaps.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Across this nation there are examples of successful efforts to integrate such students into the mainstream of the high school.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Information on such interventions, however, has not been widely circulated.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>•Perhaps the greatest departure from convention in school facilities and programming is the "alternative school".<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>For thousands of students who are dropping out of secondary school, the traditional school setting is a symbol of failure, inflexibility and irrelevance.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Groups of semiliterate, unemployed young people congregate on the streets of our inner cities.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Alternative education in the form of storefront schools or street academies represent an effort on the part of the education system to reach out and educate such youth.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Once again there are successful interventions of this nature that should be reported and shared with fellow educators across the country.</p>
<p></p>
<p>•The usual and apparently least disturbing way of dealing with pressure for "alternative schools" is to build alternatives favoured by wide segments of the public into the programs or schools of the public system, under direct responsibility of that authority.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Alternatives totally alien to the philosophy of the public schools may be provided in private schools without public support. <sup>15</sup><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is questionable if the institution in which the student has failed the first time is the appropriate one to serve the student a second or a third time.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>•If human resource development is indeed a priority for Canada, then opportunities to assist super-bright and/or gifted students to reach their potential are in order.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In this regard, advanced placement programs and "afterhours" enrichment programs in cooperation with post secondary institutions hold promise.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Independent study programs using CAI have also proven to be worthy of further investigation.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>•For kids in trouble with the law, cooperative efforts between the high school and the Departments of Social Service and Justice have been somewhat successful in recovering such youth.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Educators need to have the opportunity to share the success and failures of such strategies.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>•Native students represent a special case.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The efforts on the part of the native community to assume responsibility for the education of their youth should be supported by school boards and provincial departments of education.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Such assistance, however, should come at the initiative of the natives.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In situations where the number of native students of high school age is too small to justify a separate school, it may be necessary to continue to accommodate the students in the public secondary school.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In such situations, the native community should, at the very least, be represented on the school board.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The Issue of Linkage and Coordination</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>In their report on educational reviews, Kash and DeFaveri have noted that the most salient theme in the reviews is that schools should concentrate more than they have in the recent past on the need for preparing students of useful work. <sup>16</sup><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The Parliamentary Task Force on Employment Opportunities in the 80's stressed the importance of the links between educational institutions and the workplace.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Its chairperson makes it clear that the motivation behind his new emphasis is economic:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>"The provinces have jurisdiction in education and social services, the federal government in interprovincial industrial and employment policies, mobility and unemployment insurance.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>However, if our economy is to prosper, trained workers are essential and it is impossible to isolate in water-tight federal or provincial compartments the many policies required to meet this challenge.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is important in Canada to respect the different levels of jurisdiction, but without close cooperation and coordination our economy will flounder."</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>In a decentralized education system with no national office or department of education, there appears at times to be little by way of coordination and cooperation among the federal departments which have some involvement in education.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>For example, Secretary of State, Health and Welfare, CEIC, and Indian Affairs have responsibility for education in some form, but do not always coordinate their efforts.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The issue of coordination also applies to the plethora of national organizations representing various professional groups associated with education.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Workshops and conferences which are jointly sponsored by several agencies would appear to be strategy to be promoted.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>On the matter of school-community linkages there are a number of bridge-building mechanisms in place:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>•Cooperative education programs represent an effort to improve linkages between schools and the workplace.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But in relation to this strategy, there is no national policy, and in some cases, no provincial policy.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>What are the constraints associated with such programs?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Do all students have access?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Should the students be paid?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>How are students evaluated?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There is need for a document identifying the criteria and guidelines for successful cooperative education programs.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Such a document should be circulated nationally.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>At this point, it would appear that cooperative education programs have grown like topsy.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>•Related to cooperative education is the job-shadowing program.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is particularly useful as a tool in career guidance.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The strategy has been implemented in some of the high schools in New Brunswick.</p>
<p>•	In addition to improvement of school-community linkages, there is also need to establish more effective exchanges between high school and post-secondary institutions.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As noted previously, more appropriate feed-back mechanisms should be established, together with more meaningful transcripts - including a student portfolio.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>•An issue that relates to the matter of school-employer linkages is that of the part-time employment of secondary school students.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There are instances where students work three or more hours after school, five days week and all-day on Saturday.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>How is this affecting student performance in school?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>What is the level of cooperation/liaison between schools and employers?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Are there local and/or provincial policies in place?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>What is the role of parents in this matter?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The rapid expansion of the service sector, together with a growing market of goods for teen-agers contribute to this phenomenon.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is another reality to which our schools must adapt and adjust.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>	POSSIBLE DEMONSTRATIONS/EXPERIMENTS</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Strategies or interventions which focus on the critical issues should be "do-able" by conforming to the following criteria:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>1)	There should be some evidence, based on experience and research, that the project is likely to be successful in addressing the issues.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>2)	The intervention should be possible within the financial limits of the agencies involved.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They should seek to maximize the use of current resources.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>3)	The strategies should be seen as credible by educators, school boards, and government.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>4)	There should be reasonable assurance that the intervention, if successful, could easily be applied more broadly across the system.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>In the light of these criteria and in terms of the critical issues which have been identified, the following projects are suggested:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>1)	Identify a school or schools in which to locate a terminal or terminals to enable students and teachers to access remote data bases, e.g. <span>Informart</span>.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>•Locate the terminals in the resource centre and throughout the school.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>•Train the librarian and participating teachers in the use of the equipment.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>•The goal is to have students and teachers become comfortable with accessing remote data bases and using the acquired information in the preparation of written and oral reports.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>•If possible, establish "on-line" links with other educational institutions and use this as an additional source of information.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>An alternative would be to provide selected high schools with an amount of money within the budget that can only be used to pay the cost of accessing remote date bases.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In this case, the school would develop its own strategy for the project.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>2)	Develop a comprehensive transcript/passport/record of achievement/ portfolio which would describe a student in terms of cognitive, psychomotor and affective domains to be a suitable record of achievement for both further education,training certification or entrance into employment.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>3)	Develop a study related to improvement of communication skills including interpersonal competencies by using an experimental school and a control school.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In the experimental school, have all teachers assume responsibility for teaching communication skills (written and oral).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Design strategies to facilitate this thrust.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Run pre-tests and post-tests on participating students in both schools.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Operate the project for a three-year period following students through grades 10, 11 and 12.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Record the findings and determine if the approach has a significant impact on improving the communication skills of students.</p>
<p></p>
<p>4)	Have the National Innovations Advisory Committee begin the process of gathering information on successful innovations related to the issues in question.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Report these in a series of monographs to be distributed to all school boards across the country.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Each monograph should focus on one issue only, e.g. cooperative education, or alternative schools, or interventions for students-at-risk, etc.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The descriptions should be very brief, and include the name and address of the individual or organization available for additional information.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>5)	Invite CASB(Canadian Association of School Boards), CASA and the CTF to cooperate in developing and running on a pilot basis, a program to prepare school administrators.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>6)	Invite CASB, CASA and CTF to jointly present proposals for alternative approaches to organizing secondary schools.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>7)	Support an alternative school which leads to a regular high school graduation diploma, e.g. competency based, school without walls, etc.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>8)	Investigate the matter of student part-time employment and suggest policy guidelines which school boards across the country might adapt or adopt.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>9)	Identify criteria which distinguish a high school graduate from a person who does not graduate.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>10)	Develop an open system which will allow any person to challenge for a subject or for a high school leaving certificate.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>11)	Fund a private sector storefront guidance and counselling service with counsellors able to issue vouchers for courses offered by a public or private school, college and a university.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>12)	Develop a program planning model which starts with objectives and ends with evaluation criteria.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>13)	The establishment of a private autonomous agency to coordinate the education/training, etc. of 15 year-old-plus students who have left the education environment without a certificate.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>14)	Undertake a follow-up comparative study of teachers who have entered the profession after having received their training as "mature" students<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>vs. those who moved directly from secondary school through university to a teaching career.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Post Script</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Notwithstanding the issues raised in this paper, it should be noted that recent reviews of secondary education indicate a substantial level of public satisfaction of many aspects of the current system.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This has been confirmed by surveys of students who were more positive than negative about the quality of their schooling.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Furthermore, Canada can pride itself on having a teaching force that is competent and well qualified and which is highly regarded internationally.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Our task, therefore, should focus on refining and improving our education system rather than making radical changes.</p>

<p>Issue of School Organization (of education)</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>There has been little change during the past century in the organization of education.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>For the most part, facilities are organized to house one teacher and a group of 16 - 32 students for periods of 40 to 60 minutes, to be followed by another period wherein the same group of learners are isolated with another teacher in a different room for study of another subject.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The learning theory on which this is based escapes me.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Departments of Education prescribe graduation requirement, course content and length, teacher qualifications, and staffing patterns.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Little opportunity exists for individual schools or teachers to exercise professional judgement.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>School organization and pay arrangements are not supportive of a strong profession.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There are few rewards for outstanding performance and few penalties for failures.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Teaching is one of the few, if not the only, profession in which practitioners are paid according to their years of formal education rather than for the work they perform.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The linkage between the two has not been proven.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Experience</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Invite the CSTA and CTF to initiate proposals for different organizational structures at the school level, e.g. year round operation, collegial organization, differentiated staffing, etc.</p>
