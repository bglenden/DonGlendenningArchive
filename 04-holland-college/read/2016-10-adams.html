<div class="reader-summary">Don&#x27;s tribute to Bob Adams, a Nova Scotia colleague who introduced Holland College to DACUM (Developing A Curriculum) methodology during its foundational year. Don recounts Holland College&#x27;s initial traditional delivery model and deliberate search for better alternatives through institution visits and innovation research. He credits DACUM&#x27;s simplicity, analytical rigor, single-page competency presentation, and rating system as transformative to the college&#x27;s mission, and notes its international adoption, though sometimes diverging from Adams&#x27; original vision.</div>

<p>Dear Editor:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>A friend of Holland College</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Yesterday I learned that a former colleague had died; he was living in Dartmouth, Nova Scotia.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Few readers would have met him but many readers would have felt his impact.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You see, Bob Adams introduced Holland College to DACUM charts.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Employers may remember the three- day brainstorming sessions; students will likely remember the large sheet identifying the competencies of their chosen career. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Although Holland College operated on a traditional delivery model during our first year, we actively searched for something better.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Step one was the development of a statement of beliefs; step 2 was a search for a delivery model to match.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We visited a number of institutions and gathered information about other innovative projects both in Canada and the US, and then one day, we visited the Nova NewStart Corporation in Yarmouth, Nova Scotia, talked with Bob Adams and observed the DACUM model in use. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>DACUM was a great match; it had many of the elements Holland College was looking for; in particular we were impressed with the simplicity of the model, the analysis process, the single page presentation, and the rating system. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Since then DACUM has gone international; unfortunately, not always as Bob envisaged it.</p>
<p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>I write this note to express my sympathy to Bob’s wife, Coleen, and family, to recognize his contribution to Holland College and to call attention to DACUM, a great Canadian achievement.</p>
<p>	<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Don Glendenning</p>
