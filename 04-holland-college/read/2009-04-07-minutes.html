<p><b>U.S. Citizens Day Committee Meeting</b></p>
<p><b>April 7, 2009</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Present: Dr. Glendenning, Garth Staples, Anne Nicholson, Don MacDonald</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Dr. Glendenning welcomed all for their attendance.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In light of last year’s event, the large attendance was not anticipated and consideration of having a celebration consisting of a cake and perhaps some munchies (chips, crackers and cheese) versus a meal was discussed and there is general agreement. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The Culinary Institute is not available for July 4<sup>th</sup> this year</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span>Queen Charlotte Armouries</span> - A letter has been sent to the Queen Charlotte Armouries (Walsh/DeCoste) and they are open to staging the event.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If music is requested, there would be a charge applied.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Discussion:</b> The suggestion that the cadets prepare and serve hot dogs and/or hamburgers, is problematic if liquor is being served.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If desired to have such a service, maybe volunteers can be arranged to do the same.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Beer and Wine can be made available.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>One tremendous feature at the Armouries is the Military Museum that may be of interest to our American friends and Islanders as well who may be in attendance.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The availability of the Regimental Band is not yet confirmed. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Action:</b> Garth to contact Officer McKearney to see if they are available.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span>Confederation Landing Park</span> – It is unlikely that beer and wine could be served.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This location is a hold.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span>HMCS Queen Charlotte</span> – CFPEI held a function there in 2008 and while a very nice facility, the facility charge is considerable. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Discussion:</b> If a ship is in the harbour, this may be of interest.</p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Action:</b> Donnie to contact his son to see if a ship will be in Charlottetown on the 4<sup>th</sup> of July.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span>Officers Club (Haviland Club)</span> – The first celebration was held at this location and went well with a few hick-ups.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Garth believes that Col. Jack Stewart is the contact.</p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Action:</b> Donnie to make arrangements to view the location and contact the above recipients.</p>
