  Self assessment
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">This piece examines self-assessment as a cornerstone of effective teaching and learning. Don explains that self-assessment requires transparent processes where both assessment criteria and rating scales are known to all participants. Referencing the DACUM process and his Holland College experiences, he advocates for criteria including task completion, need for assistance, accuracy, and speed. He emphasizes that self-assessment operates on the principle that learning can be demonstrated and requires students to engage actively in evaluating their own performance under teacher guidance, creating a feedback loop essential for educational progress.</div>

I first encountered its significance as part of the DACUM process and saw it in action within the Holland College setting. Most recently I encountered it in articles on “holistic rating scales” and the teaching of mathematics.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>

<p><b>Self-assessment calls for a transparent teaching learning process with both assessment criteria and a rating scale known to all.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Typical criteria include how complete the task time, need for assistance if any, accuracy, speed but the development of a rating scale is a subject for another blog.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>

<p><b>Self-assessment works on the assumption that what one learns can be demonstrated. At an appropriate stage in the learning process. a student may select or a teacher may assign a project. Under the watchful eye of the teacher, a learner proceeds to perform the task or solve the puzzle</b></p>
