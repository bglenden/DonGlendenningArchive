  Levels-8
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">This Education 20/20 Inc. document proposes a competency-based curriculum map in mathematics, building on findings from the 2013 Community Foundation of Prince Edward Island survey of Island youth. The CFPEI report identified bright spots (community sense, entrepreneurship, volunteerism, postsecondary offerings) and concerns (job scarcity, low wages, educational deficiencies, substance abuse). Youth expressed preparedness gaps for postsecondary study and employment. Education 20/20 organized discussions and identified a need to clarify preparation gaps. The organization has focused on &quot;basic skills&quot;—foundational competencies for all citizens—and noted they lack consistent definition and priority. Don discovered a competency-based analysis of Practical Mathematics from Holland College and proposes using DACUM methodology to develop a mathematics curriculum map serving teachers, students, curriculum developers, employers, and credentialing bodies, with an externally-referenced rating scale.</div>

<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">In
late 2013, The Community Foundation of Prince Edward Island (CFPEI)
undertook a survey of over 200 Island youth to identify issues that
directly affect them; the report, T<u>aking
the Pulse of Island Youth</u>,
available on the Foundation<span lang="en-US">’s</span>
website at <u><a href="http://www.cfpei.ca/">www.cfpei.ca</a>,</u>
provides a snapshot of the findings.  Bright
spots include a positive sense of community, emerging entrepreneurial
spirit, volunteerism and new postsecondary offerings. The main
concerns include a lack of jobs, surviving on low-paying jobs,
educational deficiencies and drug and alcohol addictions.  On the
subject of education and learning, the study reports a high rate of
completion of high school and postsecondary education, a high level
of inclusivity and relatively affordable tuition costs; young people
also  expressed concerns about their readiness for the next stage of
life including:

<p align="justify" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Following
the publication of the CFPEI Report, Education 20/20 organized six
public discussions for the purpose of informing the community of the
report and its findings, learning more about youth issues in our
communities, exploring issues of education and learning, and to
identify actions to be taken to close gaps.  Discussions were lively
and wide ranging, and carried on well after the formal session ended.
  The final report included a recommendation that.

20/20 has continued its exploration under the title, “basic
skills”, meaning those skills required of any and all citizens, and
considered foundational to all other learning.  Basic skills are an
issue because:</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in"><span lang="en-US">Education
20/20has has searched, without success,  the literature, examined
curriculum materials from a variety of institutions and Provinces and
at various levels, reviewed achievement levels and assessment
procedures for the OECD sponsored PISA assessment, Canada’s PCAP
assessment, TOWES and others, for  a recognized list of competencies
to be learned.  Provinces develop curriculum based on outcomes and,
it is our considered view, that outcomes are too broad a level and do
not lend themselves to common understanding and measurement lack
readily identified assessment criteria ;</span>
the format  of outcomes used  by schools is at odds with the original
as conceived by William Spady and later proponents of Outcomes Based
Education.  An outcome is a clear statement of expectations at the
end of a learning experience; a competency is one form of outcome but
one that focuses more directly on what happens to learners.

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in"><span lang="en-US">We have now
narrowed our focus to mathematics in the belief that it carries less
cultural baggage, is a key field of student education for the
information age and is of interest to people from a variety of
institutions.  While continuing our search, but with the narrower
focus, b</span>y chance we discovered a
competency based analysis of Practical Mathematics prepared some time
ago for Holland College and the PEI Department of Education and we
propose to use this analysis as a starting place for defining the gap
in mathematics.</p>

<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><span lang="en-US">To
prepare a competency based curriculum map in the field of basic

originally developed as part of a Nova Scotia NewStart project on
Yarmouth, Nova Scotia but pioneered by Holland College in
Charlottetown.  The <span lang="en-US">“map” san serve
many users including teachers to identify what is to be learned,
students to track what has been learned, and curriculum developers as
an analysis of the field, employers to identify the expectations of a
new employee, and credentialing and qualifications bodies in
establishing qualification levels.  </span>Finally,
and absolutely critical to our project, is to develop a rating scale
based on externally referenced criteria for application to the
teaching-learning process.  .
