<p>March 31, 2008</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Mr. Robert Irving, President</p>
<p>Irving Group – Moncton</p>
<p>100 Midland Drive</p>
<p>Dieppe, NB	E1A 6X4</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Dear Mr. Irving:</p>
<p><span>Community Challenge Initiative</span></p>
<p><span></span><br></p>
<p>First a personal greeting; although it is more than 20 years since we met at Holland College, I still recall and treasure that association.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Since then, I have been closely associated with the Community Foundation of Prince Edward Island and it is in that connection that I write.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>First a brief background on the Foundation.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The Community Foundation of Prince Edward Island is a not-for-profit organization established in 1993 for the purpose of improving the quality of life in our Island communities.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The Foundation achieves this objective by encouraging individuals, organizations and communities, to establish endowments from which grants are made out of the earnings in support of the charitable interests of the donor.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The Foundation administers the funds and ensures that the grants are made for the purposes intended.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The Foundation is governed by a volunteer board of 12 Directors from across the Island.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>In practice, The Foundation carries out four functions:</p>
<p>Informing Islanders of needs and opportunities and assisting them in designing charitable responses to match their interests and resources.</p>
<p>Providing a liaison and coordination role with individuals and organizations engaged in charitable work.</p>
<p>Making grants to reflect donors wishes.</p>
<p>Administering CFPEI including investing funds.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>In addition to the normal grant making, our successes include:</p>
<p>An endowment in excess of $1,000,000 in some 40 separate funds.</p>
<p>Attracting $150,000 from an anonymous off-Island donor through which grants were made to some 60 Island charities.</p>
<p>Participating in the distribution of funds to Island charities arising from the settlement of two class action suits.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Conducting workshops for Island charities in fund raising, proposal writing and tax matters.</p>
<p>Initiating and leading an $800,000 stabilization project in the arts field.</p>
<p>Initiating linkages with summer Islanders including an annual reception for US citizens to mark their July 4<sup>th</sup> holiday.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Based on our experience, we’ve learned many things but one stands out.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Small communities respond to charitable needs on crisis basis i.e. new hospital equipment, band instruments or family emergencies – and they respond generously.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Based on that experience, it is our view that communities could benefit from taking a broader and longer term view of existing and potential needs in the charitable sector and developing a “rainy day” fund to help meet them.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Our<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>target is community funds to an aggregate of $2m in five years.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The concept is described briefly in the paragraphs that follow. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>We propose to offer an incentive to communities, not individual charitable organizations, to establish an undesignated but named “community fund” the income from which may be used for any charitable purpose consistent with Revenue Canada Regulations; the purposes for which grants may be made may change from year to year depending on local priorities, but the fund remains broad based. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>How communities organize for the task may vary, however, we propose the following guidelines:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Participation in managing the fund should be broadly representative of the community served</p>
<p>Community endowment funds will be held by the Community Foundation of Prince Edward Island in perpetuity and invested in a manner that ensures both long term growth and the making of grants on a regular basis. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Grants from a community fund will be made on the advice of the community.</p>
<p>Communities will formally apply to enter the program and may be subject to some additional restrictions.</p>
<p>Although existing endowments may be added to a community fund, only new funds will be counted for matching purposes.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Based on our own experience and information gathered elsewhere, we are proposing an incentive of one dollar for each three dollars raised by the community.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As an example, if a community raises $25, 000, the Foundation will add $8,334 bringing the total endowment to $33,334.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If they did this for three consecutive years, for example, the community would have an endowment of $100,000 from which they could make grants for charitable purposes in perpetuity...</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>To make this happen, the Community Foundation of Prince Edward Island requires seed money and by means of this letter we are inviting you to become a partner.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We believe that this is an important community building initiative since it focuses on communities working together not just separate organizations each focused on a perceived need. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Our preference is for a single partner and a minimum support of $500,000 - $100,000 per year for five years..<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This will result in an endowment fund of $2,000,000 for the benefit of Islanders and Island communities in perpetuity.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>While our working title is “Community Challenge Program”, we are open to alternatives and suggest that the name of the sponsor be a prominent component.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Working together, I am confident that we can make this an important and vital initiative in strengthening Island communities.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>We would welcome an opportunity to provide more information or make a presentation.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Should you desire additional information, please do not hesitate to let me know.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Thank you for your consideration.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Don Glendenning</p>
<p>Director</p>
