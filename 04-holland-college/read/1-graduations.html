  1 Graduations
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Don challenges the age-based graduation system, asking why students with different entry levels and learning rates must graduate simultaneously. He proposes competency-based graduation allowing students to earn diplomas upon meeting requirements regardless of time required. Drawing from his experience monitoring self-paced Holland College programs, Don notes that students completing programs early showed no performance degradation. He argues that making time the variable rather than competency would motivate students, benefit those learning quickly, and incentivize achievement. While acknowledging this complicates administration, Don asserts the pedagogical and motivational benefits justify the restructuring.</div>

<p>Dear Sir:</p>
<p><b>Graduations</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I enjoyed the recent insert in the Guardian on student graduations. Congratulations to all</p>
<p>graduates. The insert brought back many memories. I was one of 12 graduates in the first rural</p>
<p>high school built in New Brunswick more years ago than I care to recall.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>It seems odd to me that, in 2010, we still do not have a school system that allows students to</p>
<p>graduate when they meet the requirements. Students enter school at different levels and learn</p>
<p>at different rates while in school; given that they take essentially the same program how come</p>
<p>they all complete at the same time? Why not establish clear graduation requirements, award</p>
<p>diplomas when students meet the requirements, wish them well and let them be on their way.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>A few years ago, I monitored some students following a self-paced program at Holland College.</p>
<p>It was nominally of two years duration; some students finished 4- 5 months early without any</p>
<p>measurable lowering of performance. Allowing people to learn at their own pace (they do so</p>
<p>anyway regardless of school schedules) could be a major incentive in its own right. Giving prizes</p>
<p>and awards for meeting standards early would likely be an additional incentive.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Making time the variable may complicate the life of school administrators, and maybe even</p>
<p>teachers, but it would sure put a new spring in the step of most students.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
