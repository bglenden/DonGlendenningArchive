  Education-Reaching For A
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">A persuasive proposal authored by Don arguing for supplemental instruction to help high school graduates improve their grades. Drawing on his experience with Holland College&#x27;s year-round Secretarial Arts program, Don advocates for offering additional instruction days to students who earned B grades or lower, enabling them to achieve A-level performance. He contrasts schools&#x27; time-fixed approach with real-world standards where quality is paramount. The proposal addresses the Community Foundation&#x27;s Better Education Fund and seeks financial support for a pilot project. This document exemplifies Don&#x27;s pragmatic approach to educational reform grounded in his institutional experience.</div>

<p>Reaching for an “A”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Schools operate for a set number of days each year and students are encouraged to learn as much as they can in the time available.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In the world they are about to enter, the reverse holds true; standards are set with time to reach the standard being the variable. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Can you imagine a patient being turfed out of a hospital because the standard recovery time was exceeded?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Or having your car returned with only three of the four brake pads replaced because the mechanic had to move on to another vehicle?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Or the cladding being left off your new home because the builder miscalculated the time required to complete the job?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Of course not.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>So why do we accept it from our school system?</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>In the early days of Holland College, the Secretarial Arts operated on a year-round basis taking in 20 or so new students every month or two.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Students completed the program and entered the work force on their own schedule; Time in the program varied from 16 to 20 months to gain a work entry profile.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>An “A” was within reach of most students if they put in the time and effort.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I believe that most students could raise their grades by at least one level if given the opportunity.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Why not, therefore, offer high school graduates who received less than an A, additional days of instruction so that they can raise their grade?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The cost would be minimal but the benefits would be considerable. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>CFPEI proposes to support a pilot a pilot project this summer in one subject this summer.</p>
<p>Letters of interest will be solicited for a project under which students, who received a B or less will be given an opportunity to try for an A.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The pilot is not to simply re-offer an<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>existing course.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Instead students would apply to raise their grade and, if selected, would be provided with instructional support to close the gap.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As soon as a student meets the requirement for an A, he or she should be given the credit and would drop out of the program. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The Foundation sees itself as a catalyst and is seeking funds to provide an incentive for the idea to be tested. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>This is an invitation to support this initiative through a contribution to the Better Education Fund at the Community Foundation of Prince Edward Island.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
