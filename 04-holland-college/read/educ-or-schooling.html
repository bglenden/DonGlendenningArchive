  Educ or schooling
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">A comprehensive document containing multiple essays on foundational educational concepts. It includes a detailed elaboration of the schooling-education distinction using George Bernard Shaw and Bud MacDougall quotes; an analysis of &quot;vocational education&quot; arguing that medicine, law, and accounting are equally vocational as trades; discussion of the cultural divide between school expectations and workplace realities; reflections on Holland College&#x27;s distinctiveness as a technical institution separate from universities; a profound statement that &quot;If the learner hasn&#x27;t learned, the teacher hasn&#x27;t taught&quot;; and extended discussion of the teaching-learning process, advocating learner-centered approaches. This document showcases Don&#x27;s philosophical breadth and his capacity to connect educational theory to lived experience.</div>

<b>Going to School or Getting
an Education</b></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Recently
my wife mentioned that a daughter of a friend had difficulty finding
employment, especially well paid employment.  This puzzled my wife
and she added that the young lady in question” had a good
education”.  I asked “How do you know?”  My wife replied, “She
has a master’s degree from…” and she named a university.  “That
tells me about her schooling,” I said, “but how do you know that
she has a good education?”  
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">This
thinking is prevalent both inside and outside the system.  We do not
similarly confuse health and hospitalization, religion with church
attendance or citizenship with court appearances.  Why, therefore, do
we continue to speak of education when we mean schooling?  Educators,
at least, should know the difference.  In my view, it reflects sloppy
thinking.  
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Good’s
Dictionary of Education defines schooling as “individual training
or education received in an educational institution, military or
civilian.”  Education, on the other hand, is defined as “the
aggregate of all processes by means of which a person develops
abilities, attitudes and other forms of behaviour of positive value
in the society in which he lives.”  Schooling is that part of one’s
education resulting from one’s experiences while in school.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">George
Bernard Shaw is reputed to have said, “At a very early age, I had
to interrupt my education to go to school”.  Bud MacDougall, a
Canadian business icon now deceased, once said, “I left school at
14 and I’ve regretted it all my life.  Biggest mistake I ever made.
 Should have left when I was 12.”  It has also been said that we
should bestow a bachelor’s degree on all newborns so that the
process of education will not be disturbed in later life.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">I am
not knocking the value of schools; they are major contributors to
one’s education.  But so are the home, church, peers, travel, the
community and others.  The popular view is that we get our education
in schools and from elsewhere we get only experience.  But isn’t
the essence of education learning from experience wherever that
experience occurs?  One’s education is certainly lacking without
the knowledge and understanding of history, language, science,
mathematics and the arts.  Add to that the need for highly honed
communication skills.  These are certainly contributors to one’s
education but they are not one’s education.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Some
parents prefer to teach their children at home.  We call it home
schooling.  Since home schooling usually follows the school
curriculum, why not call it home education?  We refer to people being
self-taught, self made, home schooled but I’ve not encountered the
term “home-educated”.  Why not?  
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">The
school system draws its content from a narrow range of disciplines. 
Typical school subjects include English, French, science, art,
physics, chemistry, biology and mathematics.  Education, on the other
hand, draws its content from real life and addresses the issue of
what one can do with what one knows.  A measure of one’s education
is the level and extent to which one can apply what one has learned –
that is a higher level of learning than found in most schooling.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Perhaps
the difference between education and schooling is best illustrated by
the way they are described.  Our schooling is often described by the
number of years of study, the institutions at which we studied or
from which we graduated, the results of our examinations and the
diplomas and degrees we hold.  
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">One’s
level of education, on the other hand, defies such precise
description - but would likely be described in terms of ones ability
to:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
	Practice good citizenship</p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
	Communicate with people at all levels</p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
	Demonstrate personal, civic, social and environmental responsibility</p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
	Apply technology</p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
	Solve problems</p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
	Demonstrate a positive work ethic, and 
	</p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
	Exercise respect and cooperation.</p></li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Blurring
the differences between education and schooling may work to the
advantage of educational institutions but does nothing for learners. 
In fact, blurring the differences is more likely to:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
	Discourage life long learning</p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
	Create dependence rather than promote self reliance</p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
	Limit learning to what is available in school or organized by
	teachers</p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
	Limit the range of studies to traditional disciplines,</p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
	Deemphasize the importance of personal skills such as self-reliance,
	problem solving, entrepreneurship and creativity.</p></li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">A
system is in place to provide schooling, and I think it is a good
one.  But let’s call it what it is, a school system not an
education system.  Removing the confusion is a first step in
improving education.</p>

<b>What Makes Education
Vocational</b></p>
<p align="center" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<br />

</p>
<p align="center" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">For
most of my life, I have been a vocational educator, and proud of it. 
The truth is, however, that my early training and experience were in
academic or general education, and my major in graduate school was
secondary education. In fact, I am one of a very small number of
teachers in New Brunswick with a foot in both camps having both an
academic and a vocational teacher’s license, and those who read my
letters to the editor will, I believe, find that they address a broad
rather than the narrower field.  
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">. 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">The
term vocational has long lost its luster in North America but, I am
told, is still perfectly acceptable elsewhere in the world.  In my
view, much of the formal study of a doctor, lawyer or clergyman is as
vocational as that of a carpenter, accountant or nurse.  So, on what
basis do we decide whether education is general or vocational?</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><b>Course
or program name?</b>  Most would agree that welding, carpentry;
electrical, mechanics and machinist are vocational programs.  Some
would add cooking, photography and secretarial studies.  The ministry
is often referred to as a vocation.  And I certainly would add
medicine, law, accounting and the other professions.  Each is an
integrated program of studies leading to a recognized qualification
intended to prepare takers to be producers.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><b>Entrance
requirements?</b>  Should we measure “vocationalness” of programs
by the number of years of schooling required prior to entry; I’ve
encountered that approach but I also reject it.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><b>Length
of program?</b>  One could consider the length of training program as
a factor in distinguishing vocational programs.  I’ve been part of
discussions where vocational programs were defined as one year or
less, programs for technicians were a minimum of two years, programs
for technologists were at least three years in duration while four
years was the standard for a first degree. But that too has changed.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><b>Designation
awarded?</b>  Maybe vocational programs should be distinguished by
the piece of paper awarded by the training institution.  The problem
is that many institutions offer a range of programs and, while I
would argue that a degree in engineering or music is vocational I
cannot make the same argument for a general BA.  Institutions offer
too many pieces of paper for this to be a determinant.  
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">.<b>Institution
offering the program?</b>  Fifty years ago, Canada had separate
vocational schools, institutes of technology, colleges and
universities and their offerings were clearly distinguishable. 
Today, however, community colleges have become multi-purpose
institutions offering courses in a wide range of fields and levels. 
Furthermore, one can find introductory accounting courses, for
example, with essentially the same content being offered in secondary
schools, community colleges, universities and in the private sector. 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><b>Focus?</b>
 In my reading, I encountered a statement developed in the state of
Oregon on “life roles”; according to the statement, people fill
the following life roles: learner, citizen, family member,
individual, producer and consumer.  The focus may change throughout
one’s life, but the roles remain. Preparation for these roles
underlies all schooling although rarely stated.  Presumably, then,
vocational education prepares one for the life role of “producer”.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><b>Exit
standards?</b>  Performance standards also differentiate vocational
from general education.  The performance of a person learning for
vocational purposes is measured against the same criteria as the
performance of a person employed in the field.  For a non-vocational
student, however, the rating is usually on the quality of the final
product regardless of how long it took.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">In
my definition, vocational education is that part of one’s education
designed to develop and improve skills required by the learner in
his/her role as a producer. The learner’s purpose for taking a
course says it all.

<b>The Cultural Divide</b></p>
<p align="center" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Each
level of the school system has a responsibility to prepare its
students for the next stage of a student’s life. Further education
gets most of the attention; work is practically ignored.  
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Employment
is an important part of our lives; most of us work to provide the
wherewithal to do other things – own a car, travel, live on our
own, get married, and own a house.  Given the above, one would think
that “work” would be a significant component of school studies
yet schools give work a low priority if on their list at all. 
Learning some work-related skills while in the public school, it
seems, is an unplanned bonus and not part of a school’s offering
for most students.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Schools
can and should ease the transition to work.  Some schools offer
technical or applied courses as part of their regular offerings,
others have special days or weeks of job shadowing, job placements
and co-op programs; some even offer special work readiness training
but the latter tends to be limited to students having difficulty with
their academic studies. – as though going to work is something that
only applies to “poor” students.  Employment related  programs
are often based on special funding rather than  being a normal
offering.  
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Schools
can and do design some assignments to reflect real-life situations ―
that is, real life in the community, not just life in further
education.  Writing assignments, for example, can be about the impact
of an oil spill, the problem of disposing of our garbage, the life of
the earliest residents, local government issues, the impact of
increased minimum wages, the growth of the labor movement, the
closing of a local major employer, etc.  These are the kinds of
issues which students are likely to encounter later as citizens; they
are the kinds of issues likely to improve insight into the realities
of later life.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">There
is a cultural divide between schools and later life.  Schools operate
in a manner that is consistent with the model that a student will
encounter in further education but that model is at odds with the
model that students will encounter in later life.  An article in the
March 1997 issue of the Phi Delta Kappan refers to schools
“reinforcing anti-work attitudes.”   Typical examples of such
reinforcement include:</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<ul>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
	Students moving from one task to another after a set time whether or
	not the task is complete.</p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
	Students being dependent on teachers with work ending when the
	teacher leaves the room.</p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
	 Schools are lacking a service mentality; for example, they welcome
	reasons to close rather than find ways to stay open.</p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
	Schools maintain an historic industrial organization structure even
	when that structure has changed dramatically in the work place.</p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
	Students are not encouraged to take responsibility for, or to invest
	in, their own education.  If they miss a day, so what?</p></li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">To
this list I could addthat the school system:</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<ul>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
	Obscures accountability of teachers</p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
	Fails to recognize and reward high performance of teachers</p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
	Bases pay on past education and time served rather than performance</p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
	Emphasizes time rather than performance for both teachers and
	students</p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
	Has a very limited view of what constitutes education 
	</p></li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Going
to school is a student’s work and at least that part of one’s
learning should reflect community-based standards.  An article in the
New York Times of March 4, 2004 documents employer experience with
student interns.  Most, but certainly not all, of the problem areas
relate to work habits – work habits that are acceptable in school
but certainly not in the work world.  By poor work habits, I mean the
ability to work as a team member, attitude towards fellow workers and
to customers, inability or unwillingness to assume responsibility,
etc. In short, the school environment should more closely reflect the
expectations of the community that supports it, including the
employment community.  After all, that is where students will spend
most of their lives.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">I
was still living in Ottawa during “The Unholy War That Rocked
Prince Edward Island” in the late 1960’s  Reaction to the merger
of the two universities was noisy; as for a technical college, I am
told that educators saw no pressing need.   As I understand it, it
was felt that the addition of a few courses at the Provincial
Vocational Schools, or even, the addition of diploma courses at the
university would be adequate.    The expectations for the new
institution were not very great.  Forty years later, I am sure the
view has changed.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Growing
up on the east coast of New Brunswick, I was painfully aware of the
exodus of young people for Toronto and points west.  Most that made
the journey found work but for many that work was low paid and heavy;
too few could access well-paid jobs or opportunities in the then
emerging economy. The focus of college programs became an issue.  To
what extent should the College limit itself to providing training in
occupational areas not found in PEI or where employment opportunities
were limited?  The debate on this issue was neither long nor vigorous
– but it did take place.  It was taken for granted by the new
Governors that Holland College would provide training for Islanders
wherever their employment prospects would take them.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">A
modern industry requires highly skilled people.  Without matching
skills, people will not find work and without a pool of skilled
workers, industry will steer clear of PEI as a place to do business. 
An earlier item dealt with the changing Canadian labour force and the
same trends soon appeared on PEI. .</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Understandably,
people might wonder, in a small Province like PEI, if two
institutions less than a mile apart were required especially since
many of the courses had, or appeared to have, the same name and
content.  Why not, they asked, simply add a few new courses at the
local university.  A related suggestion was to mandate the new
college to provide the first year of university similar to the
CEGEP’s of Quebec.  While some of my colleagues may disagree, there
is no question in my mind but that the Island made the best decision.
  It would be difficult if not impossible to have developed programs
of the same quality and with equal integrity had the college not been
a separate institution.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Colleges

<ul>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">While
I support seamless transfer from college to university, university
transfer was not a college objective.  College programs were designed
to prepare people to enter work.  Students transferring to university
should expect credit for work completed but it is a responsibility of
a university, not a college, to provide required bridging, if any. 
The integrity of technical programs could easily be jeopardized
through tampering at the college level in order to secure more
university credit.

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Consequently,
Holland College viewed itself as an institution catering to the
interest and need of all Islanders.  Every Islander was ma potential
client.  The exception was Islanders whose first interest was in
obtaining a university degree; the college would help each student
but not design programs with university transfer in mind.</p>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Unfortunately,
I taught for several years before I began to understand the teaching
learning process.  I say this, not in the sense of blaming my college
professors but rather from the likely negative impact on my early
students caused by my deficiency.  Perhaps it was because I was the
graduate from a small high school, because my initial teacher
training was only of six months duration or even because I became a
teacher in a one room rural school while still only 18 years of age. 
In any case, my understanding of teaching and learning only jelled
several years after my teaching career was well under way.  Thanks to
additional formal study, learning on the job and a variety of both
learning and life experiences, I began to gain new insight into the
teaching-learning interaction.  
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">At
one point in my career, I was fortunate to participate in the
teaching of teachers both on a full-time and short course basis, an
experience that I enjoyed and will always cherish.  The following
statement always brought animated discussion:</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"> 
</p>
<p align="center" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<i><b>If the learner hasn’t

<p align="center" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<i><b>The teacher hasn’t
taught</b></i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">It
was not intended as a trick statement but it certainly was one that
brought vigorous discussion.  I believed the statement then and I
believe it still; a fact that tended to sharpen the debate.  Try it
on some of your friends who are teachers and judge the response by
yourself.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">The
role of a teacher is to help others learn so, if the learner hadn’t
learned the teacher hadn’t taught.  But, my student teachers would
say, some in the class would learn even if all the class did not... 
but classes do not learn; only a learner can learn; groups of
learners cannot learn but individual learners can learn in a group
setting.  One does not teach a class; one may have a class of
students but one teaches individuals not the class.  Some learners
may learn in the group setting but others may not.  The statement
therefore can only be made of a learner.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">It
is not always a teacher’s fault if one of his/her students did not
learn.  The learner may not have been ready to learn, may have
resisted learning or may have had had one of the recognized
impediments to learning.    But teachers cannot say that they taught
a student unless that student learned what the teacher taught.</p>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">At
age 17, in preparation for a teaching career, I attended Teacher’s
College in Fredericton, N.B.  Given the shortage of teachers after
the war, the Province offered a six months training program twice a
year at the newly named Teachers’ College. In September, while
still only seventeen, I commenced teaching in a one-room rural
school.  It was an experience I will never forget.  We survived; I
learned; whether students learned is another matter.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">I
still recall, at least some of the information and instruction
received in Teacher’s College about developing lesson plans, using
audio visual aids, maintaining the school register, school law,
psychology, teaching methods, etc. but I recall little if anything
about the teaching-learning process.  Learning about learning,
unfortunately for my students, came much later.  Perhaps it was
included among our studies but, if offered, it certainly did not
register with me.  Sixty years later I ams convinced that a clear
understanding of the teaching-learning process is critical; there are
three components – the learner, the teacher and the process.  Let’s
start with the learner.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Some
believe that a learner is an empty vessel waiting to be filled –
from a big pitcher, the teacher, to a small pitcher, the learner. 
Others view learners as tender plants needing protection and
nurturing with a teacher as the gardener.  While I like the latter
image, in my view, it portrays the learner as much too passive. 
Simply stated, a teacher is a person who helps another person to
learn; a teacher is a person whose role it is to create conditions
for effective learning.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Learning
is a process of change.  When a learner learns, the learner acquires
more or different information, skills or attitudes.  In educational
jargon, changes may be in the cognitive, affective or psychomotor
domains.  Simply put, a person who has learned has new attitudes,
skills or information or some combination thereof.  
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">To
learn is to change.  Learning is an individual matter.  Only the
learner can learn.  To help a learner to learn is to help bring about
changes in the learner.  The stimulus for learning may be internal or
external and the actual learning may take place in a group setting or
when the individual is alone.  A teacher does not teach a class; a
teacher teaches a number of individuals at the same time in a group
setting.  
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Readers
have likely heard the statement “A teacher hasn’t taught if a
learner hasn’t learned”.  That statement always brought vigorous
discussion in my teacher training classes.  I believe the statement
to be true but it must be applied to each learner.  A learner has
learned only if there is a change of behaviour.  
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">The
role of a teacher is to stimulate learning – to create a set of
circumstances so that a learner learns the desired behaviour. 
Teachers need a variety of techniques in their tool chest – and
they will likely require all of them.  Tools include acknowledging
successful performance, setting an example, providing information,
asking questions, setting time lines, assigning projects or home
work, organizing field trips and assessing performance. 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">The
trick for each teacher is to create a learning environment for each
learner that will end up with each learner having a favorable
experience even in a group setting.  Not easy but it is the crux of
good teaching.  This requires a clear and written understanding of
one’s teaching/learning model.  I’ve visited many schools
colleges and universities during my lifetime but am only aware of one
that had a published learning model.  Learning models should focus on
the steps expected of a learner in the teaching/learning process. 
Having a learning model in place does not guarantee successful
teaching but does give evidence that the organization has consciously
thought about the learning process and that the teaching process is a
deliberate one.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">If
you are a teacher, take a few minutes now to lay out your “ideal”
learning model – the one towards which you strive rather than your
existing one.  On the left hand side of a page, make a small box and
insert the words &quot;Student registers for class”.  On the right
side of the paper, draw another box and print the words “Student
exits class”.  Now plot the steps that the learner takes between
the entry and exit points.  The model will likely not be a straight
line so one should show the options available to a learner at each
step in the process. 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Your
model likely includes such steps as student reviews course
objectives, takes tests, prepares reports, participates in class
discussions, performs laboratory experiments, completes work
placement, takes final examination, exits course without completion,
receives course credit, etc. Remember, this is a learning model not a
teaching model.  Some steps will be sequenced but the sequence suits
the learner not the teacher and there will be a fast lane.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">During
the development process, ask yourself the following questions:</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<br />

</p>
<ul>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
	What is the first required step?</p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
	Is the sequence the same for all learners?</p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
	How do you handle a learner who already knows most of the work?</p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
	How do I know that a step is required by all?</p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
	What are the crucial points for my intervention? And why?</p></li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Answering
the last question may take you back to your textbooks and to the
latest journals.   No doubt, your model will change as your knowledge
and experience grows.  At least mine did.   With a learning model in
place, it is now possible to develop a model of the teaching process.
 My students would have benefited from my having gone through such a
process early in my career.  For those still active in teaching, it
is still not too late.</p>

<b>WHAT’’S AN “A”?</b></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">An
“A” is a high mark; the only better one would be A+, AA, AAA, or
even AAAA. The top students in school, college or university are the
“A” students.  People weren’t born “A” students; or if they
were, they were not labeled as such.  While parents may think they
have a smart child, no parent I know would refer to their child an A,
B or C child.  It is only after children start school that they
become so classified; schools like labels, I guess.  The school
system often applies other labels as well, or instead of, letters;
they may also give students a GPA. number or even a figure ranging
from zero to one hundred. 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">A
student may earn an A on a single assignment, all assignments, on
projects or an exam or even a subject studied for a whole year.  A
student who earns an A on all subjects is known as a “straight A”
student.  Many students get a mixture of A’s, B’s, C’s, D’s,
and even F’s.  Schools often average student's marks for a year
although the logic of averaging marks on such diverse subjects as
math, social studies, science and phys Ed continues to elude me.  
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">The
health system also uses numbers when determining the state of a
person’s health.  During a recent visit, my doctor quoted such
figures as 170 pounds, 120 over 70 blood pressure, pulse of 72 and
figures for PSA, cholesterol, etc.  None of these numbers required
judgment; all were based on tests.  With figures in hand, and without
averaging my test results, my doctor proceeded with judgments about
my current state of health; I am happy to report that there were no
major changes - either improvements or deteriorations.   
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">I am
intrigued by the differences in the ways the two systems deals with
their information about the individuals they serve.  A doctor uses
the numbers to determine the state of a person’s health (no
averaging of tests from different specialties); a teacher assigns
numbers to announce the level of one’s knowledge of a field.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">I
made some enquiries of schools as to the meaning of an A in education
and, in fact asked for written information; none was forthcoming. 
Some parents showed me recent transcripts which I found interesting
but not very informative.  I tried to search the internet but, not
being very skilled, had little success in finding what constitutes an
A.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">I
have trouble interpreting the meaning of an A.  Oh, I know that it
represents a judgment call by a teacher as to how well a student
knows a subject  - but it doesn’t tell me much about what a student
can do with what he knows.  Take Language Arts, for example, does
having an A mean that the person writes clearly and logically, has a
greater vocabulary than most other students, speaks well and with
logic?  If so, why not say so? If not, what does an A mean?  It
requires a definition.  Information like this would be especially
useful to employers.

<b>Inverting the Pyramid</b></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">During
the summer of 1948, I found work as a carpenter with a company
building houses at the Chatham Air Base.  I appeared at the gate
about 7:30 one morning looking for work; by 8:00 o’clock I was
assigned to a crew framing a new house.  A couple of days later, I
was cutting rafters and shortly thereafter the foreman assigned me to
fitting trim around windows and doors.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Forty
years later at Holland College, we designed programs with that
employment practice in mind, that is, we introduced students to their
field of study in the same manner that a new employee was introduced
to the real work situation.   Ours was a spiral curriculum with
learners moving from simple to complex skills just as one would in
the work situation.  Even as students moved through their program,
they recycled back through earlier skills as their interests and
performance both required and allowed.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">We
also used this approach also to bring into the instructional mix both
required and desirable skills and knowledge from science, mathematics
and communication.  Instruction and content were coordinated with
skills being learned in the field of interest.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">This
approach tended to build on the interests that brought a learner to
the College in the first place.  An added advantage was the fact
that, should a student decide at any point to discontinue training,
he or she could do so with having already gained some basic
employability skills.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">The
inverted  pyramid:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
	Capitalizes on the student’s interest</p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
	Allows students to enroll in some of their interest courses and wuld
	probably  reduce the first year drop out rate.</p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
	Provides students who drop out early with some employment skills</p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
	Reflects real life experience..</p></li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">The
reverse is to “load the first year with foundation courses -
mathematics, physics, chemistry and communications.  The theory
behind this approach, apparently, is that having learned the “general
rules”, the student is in a better position to understand the
specifics.  This emphasizes the view that learning proceeds from the
general to the specific;  based on my experience, that is not the
case.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Is
one better than the other?  That depends.  For older workers, the
inverted pyramid reflects their actual career path.    They entered
the workforce with no or a limited amount of post secondary
education, they picked up courses that were available as interest and
time allowed.  Frequently such courses were work related.  Later in
life, they took additional courses to broaden their education, to
fill in some gaps or to obtain a diploma or degree.

<b>A Four-letter Word</b></p>
<p align="center" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">While
I may not have an extensive vocabulary, I try to be reasonably
careful about the words I use.  Sometimes I slip although, even then,
I’m not prone to using words which slur a listener’s race,
gender, religion or politics.  I’m also sensitive to the use of
four letter words which, although common, may be offensive.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">On
the other hand, I am very comfortable with some four-letter words
which other educators seldom use.  The one which comes most quickly
to mind is “work” - as in preparation for work.  It is such a
descriptive word; I am puzzled as to why we do not use it more
frequently when speaking about the role of schools.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Where
I grew up, work was a perfectly acceptable topic of conversation.  As
was the idea that going to school helped prepare one for work.  It
was understood at my home that those who completed high school, and
for sure those who went beyond high school, were likely to have work
which was easier and paid better than those who did not.  The fact
that some relative or friend “got a good job” was a mark of
respect and carried to a certain degree of satisfaction -  especially
if it applied to a family member.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">My
recollection, also, is that  a student’s “going to work”-
finding a job- was perfectly acceptable topic of a conversation among
teachers or at least, between teachers and students. As teachers, we
knew that all of our students would go to work at some point in their
lives and that was one of the major reasons why they had come to
school.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Fellow
students, when I was one, talked about work, looked forward to going
to work, expected to go to work.  That was one of the main reasons
for going to school.  This also applied to studies in college and
university.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">The
idea of schools helping people prepare for work seems to have faded
from sight.  Schools now are bent on preparing students only for
further education.  In my view, preparing for further education and
preparing for work are not the same thing; the difference is in the
standards applied rather than the content taught.  
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Over
the past few years I have had opportunity to review considerable
literature from schools and from Departments of education.  My
reading suggests that, in the minds of the education officials, the
connection between school and preparation for work is tenuous to say
the least.  Schools provide career exploration, job shadowing,
transition, career awareness experiences; these are weasley words. 
They are not words that carry significance and accountability.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">So
how you may ask, if schools adopted an objective of helping young
people prepare for work, what would they do that is different from
what they do now?   Probably not a whole lot but among other things
they would likely:</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<ul>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
	Require a demonstrated acceptable level of skill in school subjects 
	If students do not reach the published standard, a graduation
	diploma should not be awarded.</p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
	Include problem solving, team work and work habits and show ratings
	in the same way they now show ratings on history or chemistry.</p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
	Require an acceptable skill level in numeracy and information
	technology skills.</p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
	Require a level of knowledge and understanding of working life
	equivalent to their knowledge of requirements for further study.</p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
	Organize schools in a way that reflects work life rather than
	academic life.</p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
	Staff schools with people having a wide range of skills not just
	high levels of formal studies. 
	</p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
	Would operate on a model that reflects real life not just formal
	education</p></li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">I
once asked a school trustee why his school did not offer more of an
orientation to later employment.  His answer was both clear and
direct.  “When the Minister tells us to, we’ll do it.”   So,
until the Minister decrees otherwise, schools will continue to limit
their thinking to further education rather than the ultimate goal of
being a productive citizen.</p>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">The
education system appears to thrive on taking control. For a period of
twelve years or more, our young people spend a large chunk of each
day and each year in a school system. The system determines the time
they leave home, when and where they get on a school bus, how they
act while on the bus, where to get off, when they enter the school,
where they store their lunch and clothes, what subjects they will
study, what rooms they will be in and when, when and where they will
eat lunch, which teachers they may have, the text books to be used,
when and where exams will be taken, when they may leave the facility,
and the list goes on.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">The
system also controls the hour that teachers work, where they work,
what they can teach, what they are paid, when a teacher must release
a student to another teacher, the teaching-learning model, etc.,
etc., etc. Not much freedom in the system; not much room for
professional judgment.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Schools
continue to operate on an industrial organizational model; most other
organizations have moved beyond that style of operation. The Minister
decrees and the system executes.  In many ways the system demands and
reinforces a kind of behaviour that is not consistent with their role
as wage-earners or members of the community.  With that kind and
level of bureaucracy, what chances does a teacher have of being
innovative? Exploring new approaches? And the lowly learner is even
more disadvantaged. 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">As
a rule of thumb, we should not put control of any aspect of our life,
including our education, into the hands of another, or at least not
for any appreciable length of time; we should take control of our own
affairs, finances, health, happiness, and I suggest, our
owneducation. I believe that this is a good general rule even while
recognizing the all of us for some periods, including when we are
young, may need to relinquish control for special purposes or periods
of clearly defined period.</p>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">We
often hear and use the term learner-centered schools or learner
centered education. But what does it really mean? Aren't schools now
learner centered. After all, schools are there for children and they
teach the things that children really need to know. How can schools
be more learners centered than that?</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Of
course, schools are there for learners and thousands of learners
present themselves to schools each day. Teachers are there to direct,
teach and help. When you examine how schools operate, however, you
will find that schools are organized for the convenience of teachers.
 They organize students based on age rather than by their learning
needs.

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">I
understand that all teachers cannot teach all subjects but am of the
view that many, perhaps even most, students could benefit from an
ongoing relationship with a teacher that much the same as a family
physician does with a patient.  Regular classroom teachers could fill
the role, but they are too busy coping with classes and subjects with
the result that diagnosis and general monitoring or progress is
overlooked. The diagnostic step is usually overlooked~ as though it
was not necessary or didn't exist. This step might be likened to a
visit to your family doctor. So a first and important step is missed
and the child enters class. Individual attention is likely not to be
provided unless the child becomes a problem - that is, falls
significantly behind the remainder of the class.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">The
current system is designed to sever the connection that a student may
have made with a teacher and, as a result, the learner moves on to
the next class and a new homeroom teacher thereby depriving the
learner of a person who already knows in some detail about his
learning style, needs, accomplishments, etc.  It is thought to be
useful in medicine for a patient to have a family doctor for years; I
am puzzled as to why a similar arrangement would not benefit learners
as well.</p>

</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
Everyone seems to have a favourite story about educational standards;
usually the story relates to communication skills and, more often
than not, relates to a student’s ability to read, speak or write. 
It has ever been thus; criticisms go back at least to the time of the
Greeks, but that is not to say that the issue should be ignored. 
What, for example, does an A mean?  Or a B or C for that matter.  In
a social or work situation, what would differentiate between an A and
a B student?  What can an A student do that a B student cannot do? 
Does an A earned in school translate into an A in the workplace?</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">As
background, I browsed a number of publications and searched the
internet for a definition of standards; a couple of definitions
referred to any &quot;criterion on which things are judged.&quot; I
also found a number of references to national standards, academic
standards, program standards and occupational standards. These are
fin, but I wanted a more basic definition.  Since the definitions I
found were incomplete, I decided to create my own.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p align="center" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<b>Standard:	</b><i><b>A standard is a level of performance expected
of a service or product</b></i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">When
applied to a school, standards are the level of service provided by a
school and may be based on such criteria as range of offerings, cost,
student staff ratio, availability of co-curricular activities,
dropout rate, degrees held by staff, volumes in the library, etc. 
When applied to students, standards refer to how well students
perform in one or more areas of study. 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">A
standard has three components, criteria, levels and a benchmark.  As
an example criteria against which to evaluate writing may include:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
	Vocabulary</p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
	Style</p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
	Use of reference</p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
	Sentence structure</p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
	Creativity</p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
	Grammar, 
	</p></li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Using
the above criteria, we could describe a number of levels.  The
following example shows six levels:</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1in; text-indent: -0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<i><b>6	Creatively written whiled observing acceptable standards of
grammar, sentence structure and organization.</b></i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 1in; text-indent: -0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<i><b>5 	Very well organized showing precise and wide vocabulary,
good sentence structure and appropriate grammar and some creativity.</b></i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<i><b>4 	Organized with few errors in grammar and sentence structure,</b></i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 1in; text-indent: -0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<i><b>3 	Organized with acceptable grammar and sentence structure.</b></i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 1in; text-indent: -0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<i><b>2 	Generally organized but shows limited vocabulary and
significant errors in grammar and sentence structure.</b></i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 1in; text-indent: -0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<i><b>1 	Disorganized and unfocused with many errors in grammar and
sentence structure accompanied by a limited vocabulary.</b></i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">We
also need benchmarks. Simply put, a benchmark is a level of
performance which is widely recognized by practitioners and which
serves as the reference point. A benchmark anchors a standard in
reality.  A benchmark for reading could be as simple as the ability
to read and discuss articles in the daily paper.   An average,
competent or skilled plumber is “a person who comes to your house
and can usually fix the plumbing problem without having to call or
return to the shop. “

 schools generally appear tominimize if not remove judgement into the
process, in real life, and in Holland College judgement was an
integral component.  To help insure relevance we selected instructors
that had worked in the specialty or supervised other I  a given

instructor not some remote Registrr; this helped insure
accountability of our instructors.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">On
the other hand, if I enter a competition, I expect to be ranked, and
have my rank made public.  But enrolling in an educational
institution is not a race, not a competition – or it shouldn’t
be.  Institutions that rank students and publicize the results are
doing their students a disservice.  While schools may teach

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Reaching
an A level of performance in any subject is within reach of most
students if given a few more hours of instruction.  If an A is
important, why not give students time to reach it?  How long it takes
to learn a skill and how quickly one can perform it are quite
separate issues. Grades, at least theoretically, point to how much
and how well a student learned in a given period of time; grades do
not tell how much a student can do or how well in a given time –
and it is the latter that counts outside of school.  . 
Unfortunately, schools place limits on the achievement of many
students by making time the constant and achievement the variable. 
Instead of designing a system that allows all students to reach the
top level, Schools impose time limits that force some students to
quit before they reach the level of which they are capable.  Our
current arrangement is to allow only one student to reach the top of
the mountain each year  and is the student, not the school that gets
penalized.</p>

I am not against student competitions and the recognition of high

rewards for educational accomplishments.  My view, however, is that
such competitions should be outside not inside the school system.</p>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Schools
are in the education business not the sorting business; they should
not be in the sorting business.  The publication of all grade
information is sorting but publication of rank is sorting in its most
odious form.  Colleges and universities are and should be free to set
the criteria for entrance and to institute their own selection
procedures.  Taking this position, I would argue, would allow schools
to concentrate on providing a good education and not limit the
educational experience to those subjects required for university or
college entrance.  Obtaining an education should not be limited to
the few courses now required for high school graduation.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">According
to what I read, many secondary schools in the USA no longer rank high
school students and some who do, refuse to release their rankings to
universities and colleges.  I am told that upwards of 50 percent of
all high schools have taken this stand.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">My
own experience with ranking is limited and ancient.  The one example
that comes to mind, however, is a grade eight or nine graduation
during which the rank of every student was given.  The event made a
lasting impression.  I’ve often wondered about the impact of that
event on the students’ future.</p>

like credentials. Places of work, whether they be trade, technical or
professional, often display credentials of people who work there. I
am not sure if such displays are intended to impress or intimidate.
Most of the credentials I see are issued by universities although
some are issued by professional and technical associations.  Such
displays tell about some life choices that bearers have made such as
where they went to school, the level of schooling they attained, and
maybe some specialized courses they have taken. In some ways it is a
little lke being baptized.  While reference is to degrees because it
makes a catchy title, my sentiments apply equally to the awarding of
diplomas.  Presumably they are placed in a conspicuous location to
support the notion that the bearer, and the person providing you
service, is competent to provide the service you are waiting for.
While I refer to degrees, I am equally concerned about the awarding
of diplomas.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Good's
Dictionary of Education defines a credential as &quot;a certificate
stating that a student has graduated from a certain curriculum or has
passed certain subjects with indicated marks&quot;. Credentials come
with a variety of labels. Most sought after and recognized is a
university degree, which until recently could only be awarded by a
university but now are awarded by some community colleges. 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">As
the user of service, I put this information in the category of
interesting but not very useful. That is not to downplay the sweat
equity people put into the acquisition of diplomas and degrees but
seldom do the items on display tell me about the competence of the
person about to serve me; a transcript is usually helpful but the
diploma or degree seldom.  In fact I would take an opposite position,
degrees, diplomas and certificate are more apt to be a barrier to
education – they restrict rather than enlarge ones field of
learning.  In my role as an employer, I cannot ever remember asking
for or receiving a copy of a degree or diploma as part of the
assessment process; I did, however, find transcripts quite useful...</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">I am
suspect of documentation from an institution that also provides
instruction, chooses the assessment criteria, conducts assessment,
sort and ranks students and issues the credentials; it sounds like a
monopoly to me.  How much weight should we give to such documents?  .
 Such documents reports primarily about input into the students
schooling rather than the output – what the student is able to do
with what he or she has learned.  I would prefer an outside opinion.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Let
me hasten to say that I am not against credentials; I just do not
think that they should be awarded by the institution that provides
instruction.  Instructing and sorting are different functions and
should not be informed by the same institution.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">My
objections to degrees and diplomas are two-fold...  The requirements
for a diploma or degree restrict rather than enhance ones education. 
Diplomas and degrees are package deals dreamed up by providers.  They
represent or reflect what the institution believes to be an
appropriate mix of classes and courses, and restrict a learner’s
opportunity to pursue his or her own creativity.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">My
second objecting is the view that sorting, deciding who receives a
credential and who doesn’t,  is not an educational activity.  It
distorts the education function.  Sorting should be done by an arms
length organization separate from the one that does the teaching.  I
certainly support the awarding of qualifications but only one that is
completely independent of the teaching institution.</p>

<h1>Choice</h1>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">My
morning paper in Panama City Beach, Florida included a half-page
advertisement by the Bay County School Authority, which read in part
as follows:</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
Parents of children entering kindergarten, 6<sup>th</sup> and 9<sup>th</sup>
grade, parents of children wishing to change schools and parents of
children new to the area had to complete a “School Choice Selection
Card”.  
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Newspapers
of the day also carried articles on the results of an OECD
international testing program, and mentioned the poor showing of
students in Canada and the USA.  An article in the St. Petersburg
Times, a Florida paper on Thursday, March 16, 2006 described the
school selection process in Clearwater.  A website for the County
identified the criteria used by school authorities when reviewing
requests; criteria included area of residence, school capacity,
preference and racial percentages; there was nothing in the list
about the benefit to learners.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">I
don’t recall seeing such an advertisement before but there have
been a number of articles in the New York Times recently attesting to
the fact that giving students a choice of schools improves the
quality of the education they receive, and likely the education of
their classmates..</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">I
thought back to when our children were young, and we were purchasing
a home in Charlottetown; our choices were limited in part because we
had to send our children to the nearest school.  Where we lived and
where our children went to school should have been separate
decisions. 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Freedom
to choose is an important right in our daily lives.  The ease with
which we can make choices helps to differentiate us from other
societies and other countries.  We may decry the choices available
but choice is available – not a perfect system but a good one. 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Significant
consumer choice, I believe, has a positive effect on suppliers of
products and services – and education is a service.  In the retail
trade, for example, choice increases the range of products and
services available, introduces more competitive pricing, lowers costs
and improves service.  Stop and think for a moment, we can choose our
church, dentist, lawyer, mechanic, mayor, retail outlet and doctor
but we little choice of schools none of the teacher who will serve
us.   Some benefits would accrue, I suggest, if greater choice were
available in the education sector.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">If
choice is good for our society generally, why not use choice as a
mechanism for improving the educational system?  Why not give
consumers of educational services an increased voice in the services
they use?  Discussions on the subject usually gets side-tracked onto
the difficulty of providing choice rather than its desirability. 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">I
believe learners should have more opportunities to make choices in
and about their education.  Not only should choice be available, it
should be promoted.  Increasing choice carries both costs and
benefits.  I admit that having choices complicates administration,
especially in small communities, but that is the nature of small
communities and applies to all services. 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Let
me suggest some obvious places to start:   
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<ul>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
	The most obvious place to start is choice of schools. 
	</p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
	Why couldn’t we provide more choice to learners as to how much
	time they spend in school?  What is wrong with more home study?</p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
	Since there is little if any, relationship between what is studied
	in high school and success in college or university much less
	success in life, why not give students more choice in the subjects
	they will study?</p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
	Since learners learn at different rates, why not let learners decide
	when o take exams.</p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
	Since the chemistry between teacher and learner is important, why
	not let learners select their teacher?</p></li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Increasing
choice in education, I believe, would have a positive impact on
education.  There was never a better time to make the introduction;
let’s not ignore the opportunity.
