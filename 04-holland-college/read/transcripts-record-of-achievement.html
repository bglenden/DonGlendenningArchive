  Transcripts RECORD OF ACHIEVEMENT
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">(168 words):** Don proposes Records of Achievement replacing traditional transcripts and degrees, providing comprehensive documentation of demonstrated competencies rather than subject grades. Current documents fail describing achievement meaningfully, emphasizing narrow subject matter while ignoring non-academic competencies important to employers and institutions. Records would document: discipline accomplishments, communication abilities, responsibility assumption, collaborative skills, technological awareness, work habits—describing demonstrated strengths rather than listing activities. Records would show growth throughout schooling and ideally extend to lifelong learning. Don acknowledges structural barriers: colleges/universities (serving only 30-35% of students) may resist; employers welcome them; supervisors understand them; personnel officers resist information complexity. The idea isn&#x27;t new but deserves reconsideration. This proposal influenced Holland College&#x27;s comprehensive assessment approach and Don&#x27;s persistent advocacy for outcome-based documentation reflecting actual demonstrated competencies rather than institutional convenience.</div>

<p><b>RECORD OF ACHIEVEMENT</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>There have been many calls for changes to our educational system and there have been a number of responses.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Included among these responses are the following:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Competency based education</p>
<p>Back to the basics</p>
<p>An increase in the number of courses required for high school graduation</p>
<p>Changes in requirements to enter College and University</p>
<p>Introduction of technology education, and</p>
<p>Greater access to computers</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>An obvious area for examination has been overlooked and that is the way we describe the achievement of students when they leave the education system.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The traditional Diploma, Certificate or Degree tells us nothing about the individual, what he is like, what he has accomplished, or his strengths and weaknesses.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A transcript helps a bit but only describes achievement in a very narrow set of life experiences.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Transcripts record one’s ability to study, recall, repeat, and explain events, phenomenon’s, and relationships in a discipline or one’s ability to perform selected skills.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This may have some value if one is entering further study but has limited value for other purposes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>School leaving documents have become instruments for screening people but I question their value in describing meaningful achievement.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The current system of describing educational achievement puts an emphasis on subject matter or content, and even that tells little about the nature and scope of study within the field.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It fails to report or describe many “ non-academic” achievements that may be important to institutions of higher education or potential employers.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is likely that the lack of an<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>adequate description of achievement deters or prevents individuals<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>from entering further education or employment where they could otherwise have succeeded.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>To replace a Degree, Diploma, Certificate or Transcript, I propose that each person on leaving school, college, or university, receive a Record of Achievement.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>A Record of Achievement is not “old wine in a new bottle” nor is it a rose by another name.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>it is a new drink or a new flower.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A Record of Achievement<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>is a concise and complete record of significant skills, knowledge, and attitudes exhibited or demonstrated or performance by an individual while in the education system.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Such a document would record achievement during his/her entire school life and would show growth (or change) during the education process.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>A Record of Achievement should include accomplishments in subjects or disciplines, describe ability to communicate (speak, write, listen), indicate the extent to which a person assumes responsibility for actions, skills of working with others, technological awareness, work habits, etc.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Records of Achievement should not limit themselves to simply identifying activities which a student engaged but rather should describe the strengths or weaknesses demonstrated through participation in those activities.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The development of a Record of Achievement of the kind describe above will take leadership and co-operation on the part of Educational policy makers.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The process of developing a Record of Achievement, should bring together all levels of education to establish both format and content.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This process, in itself, would be useful.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Ideally, a Record of Achievement would be more than that described in the above paragraphs.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It should include a continuing and life long record of educational achievement including that which relates to employment and educational growth through involvement in professional or community organizations.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The stumbling block to introducing Records of Achievement will likely lie with Colleges and Universities.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>While their views must be considered, their views should not predominate.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>After all, they only serve only 30% to 35% of young people who enter the public education system.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Employers, on the other hand, may welcome such a document.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My information is that immediate supervisors of new employees readily understand and adapt to Records of Achievement.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A different problem exists with the personal office of large corporations.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A record of achievement cannot be readily compared with customary documentation provided by applicants.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Personnel officers may call it information overload and the applicant may suffer.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The idea of a “Record of Achievement” is not a new one.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It has been proposed by many and implemented by a few for at least two decades.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In the spirit of partnerships between education and industry, perhaps it deserves another look.</p>
