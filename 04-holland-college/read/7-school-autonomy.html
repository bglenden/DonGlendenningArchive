  7 School autonomy
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">A letter advocating for increased school autonomy in PEI. Don references Holland College&#x27;s deliberate approach to operational autonomy during the drafting of the Holland College Act (where Don served as founding president), arguing public schools deserve similar autonomy. He cites OECD PISA testing research showing students in autonomously operated schools perform better, and references Mathieu Bedard&#x27;s Montreal Economic Institute paper (2015) supporting school autonomy with accountability. Don expresses one caution: schools need access to current educational research to inform their decision-making. This letter connects his personal Holland College experience to education policy advocacy, showing how his institutional leadership informed his reform vision.</div>

<p>Dear Editor:</p>
<p>School autonomy</p>
<p>I was asked recently about the lack of autonomy in our school system.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>As readers may know, among community colleges, Holland College was known for the degree of autonomy in operational matters.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That was a deliberate action taken by the College Planning Committee during the drafting of the Holland College Act. A similar level of autonomy should be given to public schools.</p>
<p>The OECD, who administers PISA tests, tells us that students from schools with autonomy in their day to day operations, do better on PISA tests.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Furthermore, a paper by Mathieu Bedard, Montreal Economic Institute also recommends increased school autonomy and accountability. (Bedard, Mathieu,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Montreal Economic Institute, 2015)</p>
<p>My only caution about such a move is to ensure that schools have access to current educational research in order to guide them in their decision making (but that is the subject of a separate letter)</p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
<p>Don Glendenning</p>
<p>Nov 26, 2023</p>
