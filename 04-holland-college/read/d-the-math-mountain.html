  D The Math mountain
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Using mountain climbing as an extended metaphor, Don argues that mathematical learning should not be described or assessed by student age. Just as mountain climbers progress at individual rates with appropriate guides and base camps, math learners need varied pacing and support structures. He questions whether we can identify root causes of post-secondary rejection or employment barriers, suggesting deficiencies might stem from age-based rather than competency-based educational approaches. The letter invites reader perspectives on this fundamental educational design question.</div>

<p>Dear Sir:</p>
<p><b>Describing the math mountain<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>People of all ages climb mountains; mountains are described in terms of elevation but there are other features and factors come into play.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The height reached may result, at least in part by features of the mountain but also may be the result of persona goals, insufficient prior experience. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Mountain operators help one climb the mountain in a safe amanner<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>as far as I know, do not limit<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>or describe your success in terms of age<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>each climbs at own speed; base camps and other recognized levels.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>While age may be a factor, I have not encountered a situation where age is a determining factor</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Math shares many characteristics of a mountain with teachers to help ensure your sa successful climb.you climb <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>are not described by the age of the climbers; neither should math be described by the age of the learners.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It seems to me that<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>one deIs there such a thing as a leading cause, a deficiency, as to why people aren’t accepted into postsecondary studies or a first job?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Can we trace non-acceptance to something missing in their previous education?</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Your views are always welcome at standards2020@gmail.com. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
