  Literacy
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Extensive document providing literacy definition (&quot;ability to understand and use printed information at home, at work, community to achieve goals and develop knowledge and potential&quot;), components (prose, document, numeracy, oral communication, computer skills, working relationships), and assessment criteria (phonemic awareness, fluency, vocabulary, reading comprehension, rapid automatized naming). Cites PEI demographics showing 30% of adults have very low literacy rates, average adult literacy below level 3, and 43% of Islanders unable to manage newspapers/telephone books. Identifies issues: continuity of funding, divided jurisdictions, lack of specialized diagnosis, stigma attached to &quot;literacy,&quot; insufficient help for parents, inconsistent reporting/standards. Proposes &quot;modest proposal&quot; including: commending Department&#x27;s reading emphasis, identifying reading as separate subject, ensuring qualified reading teacher per school, sharpening outcomes/standards, establishing reading clinic outside schools, supplementing library staff for tutoring, establishing public membership-driven reading association. Surveys current PEI providers: School system, Holland College (estimated 90% of adult literacy training), Department of Technology and Advanced Education, PEI Literacy Alliance (30 institutional members), and lists 25 other participant organizations. Includes detailed reading assessment criteria, skills lists, literacy benchmarks (Level 3 = reading daily newspaper and conversing about articles), and project implementation guidance with 10 considerations including clear focus, measurable objectives, family support, competency clarity, documentation, 3-5 year timeframe, evaluation, partnerships, minimal bureaucracy, decision-making authority, replicability.</div>

Literacy</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Did
you know that thirty
percent of
Islanders have low levels of literacy? That means that many Islanders
would have great difficulty in finding jobs in many fields especially
emerging ones.  Worse still, the rate has not improved in the past
decade.    
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"> 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">People
think of literacy as the ability to read; it is that, but it is much
more.  At least by some definitions, literacy includes the ability to
use numbers, solve problems, communicate orally, use a computer and
even the ability to work with others.  Sometimes these are referred
to as essential skills; personally, I like the term basic skills
because they provide the foundation for other learning.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">There
are many providers, Holland College, UPEI, The Literacy Alliance, the
Provincial Library system, the public school system and Provincial
Government to name but a  few.  And these do not include a number
other organizations who encourage and sometimes fund literacy
programs.  To that list should be added the many volunteer tutors and
coaches. 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Funding
sources are many.  This Many come together under the umbrella but
many training programs seem operate in separate silos.  The literacy
educators I met are commited to and have a passionpassion for their
work. They are the unsung heroes in the education of adults. 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">I
told that improving one’s literacy benefits from involvement of the
entire family.  I did encounter a project involving mothers and
infants but none involving the whole family. Sponsored activities
like raise a reader, employer based</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Literacy
can be demonstrated.  It can be described, competencies can be
identified, and levels literacy can be set and students performance
rated.  Levels have been established, at least for adults but the
ones I saw lack detail.  Missing also is a benchmark that is so
necessary to anchor rating scales in the real world.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">While
this is not my area of expertise, literacy education would benefit, I
suggest, from working together to address the literacy needs of a
specific community instead of each organization carrying out its
activities in isolation from each other.  Given the way we have
segmented education, it appears that no one has an overall
responsibility to make this happen.</p>
