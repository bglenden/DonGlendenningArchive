Cover page for &quot;Education Framework&quot; (referenced as Doc/About/Binder 4), authored by Donald E. M. Glendenning, Charlottetown, PEI, 2024. Indicates companion volume to the About Education binder. Suggests Don developed multiple related education analysis documents exploring different aspects of education systems and reform. This framework document (Binder 4) appears to present structured analysis of education organization and functional requirements, while the About Education binder (Binder 5) provides thematic exploration. The parallel creation of multiple education binders in 2024 demonstrates Don&#x27;s sustained intellectual engagement with education reform in his final year.

Don argues current discussions focus narrowly on schools, storms, technology, and classroom matters rather than larger agenda: preparing all Islanders (all ages, interests) for current and future challenges. He emphasizes education as service helping people with learning, though many view it as product delivery (credits, diplomas, degrees). Don proposes mechanisms for dialogue: PEI Board of Education (12-person general oversight, like Washington State or Holland College Board), curriculum advisory committees including students/parents/employers/post-secondary/certification bodies, and community education commons.

Don explains his choice to write letters to editors rather than academic journals, believing systemic education change comes from citizen and parent pressure rather than internal system reform.

Don defines governance as &quot;who makes what decisions, and in what manner.&quot; He identifies underlying confusions between education/schooling and credentials/qualifications. The paper extensively documents that research shows direct relationship between school autonomy and student performance (citing OECD PISA data). Don emphasizes teachers should serve as &quot;educational family doctors&quot; with accountability for learner outcomes. He proposes clear decision-making assignments: learners/parents select schools and programs, teachers make professional decisions for assigned learners, principals focus on instructional leadership, trustees/superintendents operate schools, Deputy Ministers ensure quality education for all Islanders. Includes detailed Albertan school board decision examples and PEI trustee responsibilities. Advocates for immediate changes: consolidate educational responsibilities, delegate administrative decisions, clarify principal roles, assign student decisions to teachers, establish independent qualification authority. Later &quot;Thoughts on School Governance&quot; section dated May 25, 2012 emphasizes governance model could remove change barriers when combined with professional freedom and accountability.

The review concluded the program provided critical organizational development, noting that external assessments, workplan development, training opportunities (governance, fiscal management, planning, marketing), networking, and strategic investments (equipment, technology) strengthened organizations. The &quot;Looking Forward&quot; section recommends continuing organizational assessment as funding criteria, establishing on-Island training programs (possibly through Holland College), creating annual training for arts managers and boards, developing industry cohesion (through a PEI Arts and Culture Sector Council), strengthening government relations on arts policy, and building arts-tourism linkages.<div class="expanded-tags"><span class="badge badge-low">PERSONAL_AFFAIRS</span></div><div class="expanded-file"><a href="read/strategic-initiatives-arts.html">Read</a> · <a href="files/Strategic%20Initiatives-arts.doc">Download</a></div></div></td>

Don cautions against oversimplified &quot;partnerships&quot; concept; school leadership involves delegation but not partnership between minister, trustees, teachers, or students. Advocates for professional teacher partnerships instead. Draws directly on Holland College experience: 1969 planning committee chose Board of Governors over provincial management model (unlike most Atlantic sister institutions). After 40 years, Don concludes College &quot;would have been quite a different institution&quot; with provincial model—demonstrates governance model importance. Emphasizes key to improvement is learner-teacher interaction quality; every recommendation should ask &quot;How will this improve learner experience? How do I know?&quot; Advocates for clear written operating principles.

Drawing on Robert Paul Wolff&#x27;s 1969 framework, Don distinguishes three separate functions: criticism (feedback for learning), evaluation (establishing performance levels), and ranking (comparative assessment). He argues these functions have become dangerously conflated in educational institutions. Don proposes that grading students is fundamentally not a school function—schools should focus on teaching, while separate qualification authorities (like Holland College&#x27;s partnership with the Apprenticeship Branch) should handle certification.

He reflects on early carpentry work at Chatham Air Base (summer 1948) where employees learned through immediate immersion in real tasks, progressing from simple to complex skills. Holland College adopted this &quot;spiral curriculum&quot; approach—students begin with field-specific interest courses rather than foundational prerequisites. This inverted model capitalizes on learner interests, reduces first-year dropout rates, equips early departures with employable skills, and reflects actual work-world experience. Don contrasts this with traditional approach of loading first-year with general subjects (mathematics, physics, chemistry, communications). He argues the inverted pyramid better suits older workers who gained work experience before formal education and took courses opportunistically throughout their careers.<div class="expanded-tags"><span class="badge badge-low">INSTITUTIONAL</span></div><div class="expanded-file"><a href="read/pyramid.html">Read</a> · <a href="files/Pyramid.doc">Download</a></div></div></td>

Don distinguishes assessment (feedback-focused) from grading (standardized achievement measurement). Notes that most developed countries except US and Canada separate teaching and grading functions. Proposes that grades should reflect competency achievement, inform students and parents, represent individual achievement, and motivate improvement. Emphasizes that grading standards should vary by competency and purpose. Argues that ranking is not an education function and that established qualification authorities (like those in other developed nations) better communicate education results.

Central to his vision is Benjamin Bloom&#x27;s taxonomy and his observation that public schools remain stuck at the comprehension level rather than advancing students through analysis, synthesis, and evaluation.

This essay defines the philosophical differences between colleges and universities: colleges emphasize applied knowledge, intensive specialty study, field-derived content, employment success metrics, integrated theory and practice, and industry partnerships.

The school located classes throughout the city in libraries, galleries, churches, and available spaces rather than in traditional buildings, with teachers&#x27; first task being to secure meeting space. Don reflects that while interesting then, schools without walls are now more feasible given internet information access, competency-based education, performance assessment, computers, and individual learner management systems. He proposes two implementation scenarios: apprenticeship programs using competency analyses with learning managers (unlike teachers, more akin to physicians) who identify needs, create learning plans, secure opportunities, and provide feedback. The learning manager contracts specialized instruction and arranges apprenticeship testing and placement with employers.

Schooling-education distinction emphasizes that schools contribute to but don&#x27;t monopolize education; homes, communities, peers educate as well. Current conflation discourages lifelong learning and non-school learning recognition. Vocational education definition derives from learner purpose, not content: same course becomes vocational or academic based on employment intent. Cultural divide essay identifies school-work disconnects—task-switching regardless of completion, teacher-dependence, absent service mentality, outdated industrial structures, minimal student responsibility. Don proposes cultural, not curricular, solutions: individual focus, output emphasis, achievement measurement, teacher accountability, learning plans, skills emphasis, community standards. Holland College founding reflections defend the separate college approach, emphasizing quality over university-transfer convenience. His teaching principle—&quot;If the learner hasn&#x27;t learned, the teacher hasn&#x27;t taught&quot;—recognizes learning as individual responsibility while placing accountability on teachers. Continuous intake advocacy proposes flexible enrollment matching hospital practice: instructional time becomes variable while achievement standards remain constant.

Using his high school shop class experience (40% theory, 40% practical, 20% attitude), he argues attitudes are undervalued—they&#x27;re actually the most important employment factor. He rejects averaging theory and practical grades, comparing it to averaging someone&#x27;s comfort by averaging head-in-freezer and feet-in-oven temperatures. Don proposes performance criteria (Quality, Quantity, Problem-Solving, Leadership, Supervision) with contextual levels derived from real-life occupational standards. His conclusion emphasizes that performance assessment remains education&#x27;s uncharted territory despite its critical importance.<div class="expanded-tags"><span class="badge badge-low">PERSONAL_AFFAIRS</span></div><div class="expanded-file"><a href="read/03-assessing-performance.html">Read</a> · <a href="files/03%20Assessing%20Performance.doc">Download</a></div></div></td>
