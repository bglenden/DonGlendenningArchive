After the widower proposes and the widow says yes, he cannot remember her response the next morning and must call to confirm. She had also forgotten who asked her. A charming tale celebrating memory loss, romance, and humor in later years. Found in Family Tree Maker folder (possibly misfiled), suggesting this sentimental story may have resonated personally with Don during his own later years.
