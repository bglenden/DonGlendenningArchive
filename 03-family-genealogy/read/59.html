Contains photographs of his great-great-grandparents Alexander MacDonald (b. 1775, Assynt, Scotland; d. 1843 at Little Branch) and Grace MacAskill (b. 1781, d. 1874); their son John D. MacDonald (1817–1900) and his wife Elspeth Jardine (1821–1907); and John&#x27;s daughter Grace (Don&#x27;s grandmother, 1848–1934) who married Jubal Watling.

	<p align="justify" style="page-break-after: avoid"><b>Photos</b></p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">I
	am grateful to Cameron MacDonald for copies of the photos appearing
	on the left.  We are not certain, but they may be my GGGrandparents,
	Alexander and Grace (McAskill) MacDonald, their son, John and his
	wife, Elspeth Jardine.</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">Alexander
	MacDonald (top left), my GG Grandfather, was born in Assynt,
	Scotland in 1775 and died in Little Branch in 1843.  His wife, Grace
	MacAskill was born in 1781 in Assynt, Scotland and died on February
	23, 1874 in Little Branch.  Alexander MacDonald was granted 225
	acres (Lot No.2) at Little Branch on June 3, 1812.  They had nine
	children.  The original house, I believe, was in the field above
	where Norman Glendenning now lives near the old apple orchard.</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">John
	D. MacDonald, (centre left) my Great Grandfather, (1817-1900) owned
	the land where Uncle Jim Watling lived; his sister, Jessie, owned
	the land where Norman now lives.  (Each received half of the
	original property)  John married Elspeth Jardine,  (1821 –1907). 
	They had 10 children including a daughter Grace, my Grandmother,
	(1848 – 1934) who married Jubal Watling (1846 – 1915).  Jubal
	and Grace lived for a while at the Meadows but moved to Little
	Branch in 1901.</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	<p align="justify"><i><u><b>Again,
	these may or may not be correct but I thought that you would be
	interested</b></u></i>.</p>
	<p align="justify" style="page-break-after: avoid"><b>Grandmother</b></p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">I
	barely remember my Grandmother Watling.  She died in 1934 but I do
	recall her as a small wiry woman.  I can remember her buttoning the
	top button of my shirt or buttoning my windbreaker because she
	thought I would get sick from the cold.</p>
	<p align="justify" style="page-break-after: avoid"></p>
	<p align="justify" style="page-break-after: avoid"><b>Update</b></p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify" style="page-break-after: avoid">A
	note from Arthur Mills tells me that George Dutcher of Hardwicke
	owned a sloven that he used to haul the thresher and other large
	machines.  Enid says her Grandfather had one in Sussex and she
	thought that they were manufactured in Saint John.</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<h6 align="justify" style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">Fresh
	Fruit</h6>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">Dorothy
	MacKay recalls an incident during WW2 in which a truck overturned on
	Johnny Dick’s hill spilling peaches, pears, green gage plums and
	perhaps other kinds as well. Local kitchens buzzed for days as they
	preserved the fruit before it spoiled.</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">I
	wonder if that could have been Jack MacMaster’s truck from
	Hardwicke.  I know that he used to truck apples and perhaps he
	trucked other fruit, and even fish, as well.</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">On
	late afternoon, Jack MacMaster turned into our place with a big load
	of apples that he was selling from door to door.  His truck broke
	through the bridge by the concrete gatepost.  I remember the dual
	wheels down through the bridge but cannot recall how he got out.  He
	may have had to unload the apples.</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify" style="page-break-after: avoid"><b>Robert
	Stevens</b></p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">I
	was delighted to hear recently from Robert Stevens who provided some
	new information about the Peters family (My Grandmother was
	Elizabeth Peters.)  I do not have enough information yet to make a
	clear statement on our relationship but we can both trace roots back
	to William and Anne (Bidders) Harley.  I’ll have more on this
	later.</p>

	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">My
	Christmas card of the Little Branch Bridge brought back memories to
	Marjorie (Watling) Young.  As a youngster, when returning home from
	the Cameron’s after dark, Iona and Wilna would walk back with her
	as far as the bridge.  Iona and Wilna would stand at their end of
	the bridge while Marjorie ran through.  Once on the other side, Iona
	and Wilna would go back home.  Sometimes the boys would hide in the
	bridge, it was unlighted, just to scare the girls.</p>
