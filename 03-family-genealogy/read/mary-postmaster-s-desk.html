</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Don writes to Mary about an antique postmaster&#x27;s desk from Hexham, New Brunswick with family/community connections. He traces the desk&#x27;s history through Bob and Ira MacDougall and suggests it be preserved as local history, offering to help contact the NB Archives. This anecdote reveals Don&#x27;s attention to family and community heritage.</div>

<p>Happy Easter</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Great to talk with you the other night and to know that you are on the mend.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It won’t be long now until you’ll be thinking of opening your cottage although the snow in the forecast is not very spring-like.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I’ve been intending to mention the old postmasters desk in your garage but forgot each time I visited so decided to send this note.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Since I am mailing this to your Black River address, I will also send a copy to Jeannie in case you are still in Moncton.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>One time I was with John when he stopped at Ira MacDougall’s place in Loggieville to purchase something.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Did Ira sell farm equipment of supplies?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>While looking around waiting for John, I spotted an old desk in the shed. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When I asked Ira about it, it turned out to be, as I recall, the old postmaster’s desk used in Hexham by Bob and Bioney – and maybe others before them. (Bob and Ira were brothers, I think)<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>As we drove home, we talked about it and the fact that it was a genuine antique.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I was not particularly interested in it myself but thought it should be saved.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>On a return visit John got the desk from Ira, I am not sure if he paid for it or Ira simply gave it to him.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The last time I saw the desk, it was along the side of the garage next the road and was used for storing nuts and bolts.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I thought that I should let you know, Mary, so that it can be kept.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>While it does not have a family connection, it is part of our Black River history.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I am sure that the NB Archives would be interested if your family isn’t.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I searched the internet, and am enclosing what I found about Hexham post offices.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Just thought that you should know</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Regards to all the family</p>
<p><br></p>
