<p><b>BACK TO NEW BEUNSWICK</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Note:	The following random notes were gathered primarily from family and are in random order; hopefully I can both add to them and put them in order at some future date.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Dad purchased the property at Little Branch, where Norman now lives, from Alexander and Ethyl MacDonald on July 21, 1914 for the sum of $800.00.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was known as the Jessie MacDonald property.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"Miss Jessie" who was a schoolteacher, died in 1912.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This property was directly across the road from where Mum's father and mother lived.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The western property line, starting at the Little Branch School, forms the back property line for many of the properties along Black River.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The rear of the property was known as Jessie's Corner - probably at the rear of either the Godfrey or Gibson property. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>While I have not completed my search or county records, I believe that the property passed from John MacDonald to Jessie and on her death from Jessie to her nephew, Alexander MacDonald</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The original house, owned by Miss Jessie, was a traditional “story and a half” with a gable roof and built end on to the road.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Dad added an ell, likely in the early 1920’s, suing lumber he cut on the property including a hardwood for the floor.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The space added to the main floor included a large kitchen, pantry, back entry and another stairway to the second floor as well as one to the basement.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Upstairs was added two bedrooms and a large closet/storage room.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is likely that a new concrete wall was placed under the entire house at the same time.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A veranda was added along the entire length of the house.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The barn was lengthened (doubled) with room for horses, pigs and a haymow.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Lillian remembers Dad up on the roof shingling at daybreak.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Mum came home from Tennessee prior to Walter’s birth in September 1913.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Dad may have come at the same time because work on Ocee #2 ended about that time.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In any case, Post Office records show that Elmer Glendenning was appointed Postmaster on November 1, 1914 and resigned on August I, 1916. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The family must have moved shortly thereafter to North Haven Connecticut because Lillian was born there on January 8, 1917.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Dad and Mum moved back to Canada in 1919 (In May we think) and took up residence at Little Branch.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Norman Glendenning has records that show that Dad purchased 18 acres of land from James Finno on June 11, 1924 for $900.00.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>On July 27, 1929 he purchased the "Mac" place from Jane MacDougall.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Venetia thinks that the property, up to Hexham corner, was owned by Jane and Anne MacDougall.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Later Bob and Bioney MacDougall moved to the house at Hexham from their place down on MacDougall’s Point beyond Harper's.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Dad also purchased about 70 acres of land, with 12 acres cleared, from Dan MacLean.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Dan, who was a Great-Uncle to Harry MacLean of Black River, lived on the property with his sister Lizzie.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When Dan died, Lizzie moved to the "poor house".<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Agnes Gibson (Glendenning) remembers when Dan died - likely in the early 1920's.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Walter built a house there in 1938 and 1939 and he and Agnes lived there until 1958.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Dad brought a property from Bob Mac Lean, Dan's brother, 1931.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The arrangement allowed Bob to live in the house until he died.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>According to the agreement, Bob was to have the harvest from a field of oats and a barbed wire fence. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>At the same time, a right of way was granted to the Dan MacLean property.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Records show also that Mrs Moodie (Bob’s sister? Held a mortgage on the property.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As I recall, Harry MacLean discovered Bob dead in the house in the early 1940's.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>John and Mary built a house on the Bob MacLean property.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The old MacLean house was fixed up and is still used for storage.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>On November 29, 1926, Dad bought property from James A. and Kathryn Watling.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>For some reason, the transaction was not registered until September 17, 1929.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This property, presumably, was the narrow strip of woods between Uncle Jim and Ian MacNaughton.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>While discussing VE Day with Vance MacNaughton in June of 1995 at the shopping mall in Douglastown, he told Ken and Don about his memory of VE Day.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Apparently Vance was in the Little Branch School.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Suddenly, there was a knock and the school door flew open and Mum announced to teacher and students that "The War is over".</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Dad owned first a Model T Ford and later a Model A Ford.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The model T had a soft top with curtains on the side.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>One of the cars, Lillian thinks, was purchased from<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>McLennan’s Garage in Chatham.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>MacLennan's garage was located on the corner of the Park probably the site of MacCarthy's (and Flett's) garage in later years.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Grace was learning to drive at the time and the salesman took Grace for a drive in the car.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The other car, the Model A, I think, was purchased from the Babineau sisters; the Babineau family operated the cinema in Chatham.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Both Walter and Lillian said that one of the cars was bought the day Annie MacDougall died.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Dad was not considered a very good driver.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Venetia recalls that Aunt Venetia came to New Brunswick, perhaps for Grace’s wedding.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Dad took Aunt Venetia for a drive to show her around.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>(I think that I went along for the drive) On her return, Aunt Venetia said she now understood why Mum did not want to travel in the car when Dad was driving.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Lillian remembers going in the Model T with Dad to Moncton to bring Grace and Gladys MacNaughton home from Business College.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Lil Cormier went along for the trip.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>On the way home, somewhere south of Rexton, Dad upset the car.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Grace broke her wrist and Dad had some cuts and bruises. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Lillian also recalls that, on the same trip, they stopped in Rexton on the way home and had supper with a friend.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>On the way home they encountered some people who tried to run Dad off the road.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They were drinking and may have been rumrunners.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Dad pulled into a store and phoned the police to come from Newcastle.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Lillian drove back as far as John W MacNaughton=s in the police car.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She also recalls that there was a dance that night in the Little Branch School.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Venetia was at that dance.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Dad would have earned good money when he worked in construction.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I vaguely recall seeing a pay envelope one time that showed he earned 90 cents an hour but I am not real sure of this.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Apparently he left his money in a bank in the USA, perhaps Portland, and lost some money in the crash of 1929.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Patricia Hubbard wrote the history of the Northumberland cooperative.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In it, she records some comments by Charles Butler about members of the Northumberland Agricultural Council.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>About Dad, Butler said " a big man with tremendous capacity for hard work".</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Dad had a team of oxen which he used around the farm.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Lillian remembers using them to haul sap from back on the "ridge".</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Dad was active in the community including a founding member of St. Paul's Presbyterian Church (on June 14, 1926 was elected to the first Board of Managers (Trustees), was a prime mover in the construction of a community hall, was a founding member of an Agricultural Society (#103) and was its Secretary Treasurer for many years which included the purchase and sale of fertilizer, seeds, lime, etc. for the local farmers. He was active in the Orange Lodge, Oddfellows, and Masons.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>In addition to farming, he and his brother-in-law, John W. MacNaughton operated a pulp business. They operated a "rosser", a machine for peeling pulp in Middle Black River, across from the Cameron School, and operated lumber camps in St. Margaret's and the Black River area. (Across the road from the Cameron school) He continued to be active in construction and built the bridge at John Godfrey's and John Dick's. His last job away from home was the construction of Tinker Dam near Woodstock, NB</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Elmer Glendenning was known as a hard worker. He built and repaired his own harness, re-soled shoes, and made axe handles. Even when he was not able to work, Brydone Weeks told that Dad had himself taken to the field in a wheelbarrow where he sharpened the scythes while the men were cutting marsh hay.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Walter remembers the wagon rack breaking one evening when coming from the woods with a load of wood.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Later he and Dad returned to the woods, unloaded the wood, cut poles, repaired the wagon rack, and returned home so that the wagon load of wood was ready to be taken to Loggieville the next day.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Part of the repair work was carried out by the light of a lantern.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Lillian believes that Dad worked for a while with Uncle Bob Doring.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Ken recalls that Dad had cleared some land in the back field, behind where Eric now lives.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He had requested a fire permit to burn brush.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Expecting it in the mail, he decided to go ahead and burn.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The permit did not arrive; the fire jumped the ditch and got into the woods.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Dad and others carried barrels of water on a truck wagon from the river to put out the fire.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>John Fowlie, who was the local firewarden called the RCMP because Dad was burning illegally.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Two RCMP officers arrived; one was Bedford Peters a first cousin of Dad=s and the other was Aubrey Falls.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>On the way in to Black River, Bedford had stopped and picked up the required fire permit.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Lillian arrived home from the USA in the midst of all the commotion.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Dad suffered for a number of years with pernicious anaemia (or was it leukemia ?).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Lillian thinks that his illness was first diagnosed in 1933.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Doctors prescribed nearly raw liver mixed with tomato juice.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He also visited doctors in Montreal.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Mum said that the doctor said that he had lived five years longer than they thought he would.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He died at home in 1938.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Venetia recalls Mum saying that doctors in Montreal congratulated Dr. MacKenzie for diagnosing the problem so early. His obituary is included at the end of this document.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Also included with the obituary, is a piece of poetry written, I believe, by Mrs. F. A. Fowlie on the day that Dad was buried.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Mum continued to live at home after Dad died.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Her sons ran the farm until they married and moved away.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Norman and Jean married in 1951 and Mum continued to live with them until she died in 1964.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Mum died in the Miramichi Hospital of cancer of the pancreas having been in the hospital only about two weeks.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Her obituary is included at the end of this document.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>For more that 20 years, the Glendennings held a picnic at Ken’s cottage on the lasts Saturday in July.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>At the family reunion on July 29, 1995,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Ruth (MacNaughton) Lewis mentioned a piece of poetry written which she had in her possession which had been written by Mum.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Later Ruth sent me a copy, which I am including in this history.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Marjorie (Watling) Young told me that she went across the road to Aunt Jane’s every day.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Dad always wanted her to sit in to the table and eat.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Walter always gave her a whisker rub.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Mum always had cookies.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Maria Stone boarded at home for a while. She may have been a teacher.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Mum was active in the community including the establishment of St. Paul’s Presbyterian Church and was a member of the women’s Missionary society and the Women’s League.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She was also a long time member of the Black River women’s Institute. She was an active supporter of education and for the establishment of the Miramichi rural High School.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She was often called on by families in the community to help out when a child was born or someone died.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>In reporting her death, the Chatham Gazette noted, “she took a keen interest in community activities and was especially interested in education.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>At her death, the remaining property passed to her son, Norman.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Jean, Mrs Norman, Glendenning remembers her Uncle Allie MacDonald telling about working in the woods with Dad.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Apparently Dad lumbered Willard’s (Jean father) place the year he bought it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Allie was on the other end of a crosscut saw with Dad.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Dad said, ”I don’t mind giving you a ride, little man, but please don’t drag your feet.”</p>
