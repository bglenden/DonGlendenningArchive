  MacNaughton Connection
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">A genealogical summary (by Don Glendenning) of the MacNaughton family roots, tracing from John MacNauchtan at Dunderave Castle, Scotland (died before 1750) through Malcolm and John to Alexander (1789–1849). Establishes that Christina MacNaughton (1822–1901), Don&#x27;s great-grandmother, married Jubal Watling (1823–1900); their son Jubal (1846–1915) married Grace MacDonald (1848–1934); and lists their eight children: Christina Catherine, Elspeth Jardine, Jubal George, Janet, John McDonald, James Alexander William, Jane Elizabeth Jardine, and Donald Ernest Watling. Shows Don&#x27;s Scottish heritage through maternal connection and completes the genealogical chain leading directly to him.</div>
