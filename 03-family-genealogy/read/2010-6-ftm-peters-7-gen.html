<p>My grandmother, Elizabeth Peters, married Walter Glendenning.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Settlers of the Bay of Chaleur says that the Peters came from Ireland, however, my search shows also shows Peters meaning "Peter- a rock", is not uncommon in the<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Angus, Kincardine and Aberdeen areas of Scotland. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The name John Peter is found in 1636, Andro Peter in Kirkcaldie in 1840, David Peter in Peebles, southern Scotland, in 1645 and Alexander Peter in Melrose in 1648.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The name is also found in southern Scotland which is closer to Dumfrieshsire.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Peters, Pieter, Peterson and probably Petrie have the same roots.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My references show Peters as a Sept of both the MacGregor and MacLaren clans.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The name Petrie was found in Balwelow in 1513, Andrew Petrie was Vicar of Wick Caithness in 1530 and there are a number of later references.

<p><span>Notes for W</span>ALTER<span> G</span>LENDENNING<span>:</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Walter Glendenning was the youngest child of John and Elizabeth (Harley) Glendinning and was born on 26 November 1845 while the family was still living at Salmon Beach. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>On March 2, 1872 Walter Glendenning, married Elizabeth Peters; on February 17, 1873, Lot 30 was granted in Walter's name.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is interesting to note that, while John, Sr. petitioned for the lots, they were actually granted in the name of the sons.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Walter's father and mother continued to live with them until their deaths, John, Sr. died in 1877 making, as the 1881 census shows, Walter as the head of the household:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Walter Glendinning of the Parish of New Bandon petitioned (F9029) for "one hundred acres situate as follows: Lot No. 30, Canobie, formerly surveyed for Charles Scott. By him transferred to John Glendinning and from John Glendinning to his son Walter the present applicant.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The land is said to be occupied by the applicant, Walter Glendinning, and his father and improved by applicant and his father."<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A notation on the top of the petition shows 1865.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Interestingly, the top of this form is pre-printed with the word "AUCTION". <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>My other source shows a grant of Lot #30 in Canobie to Walter Glendenning on February 17, 1783.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That is quite a lag between the making of a petition and the actual grant being made.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The property is directly across from the Canobie School, which is now the Women's Institute Hall.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The old home stood, among what is now a clump of trees.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I believe that the homestead was inherited by his son, Leonard; later generations knew the area as Leonard's Hill.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Walter was active in the church including being a Sunday school teacher.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>At first, church services were held in the local school.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Later Trinity Union Church was erected in 1899 about a mile from the Glendinning property and was used by Presbyterians, Methodists and Anglicans.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>(It is now an Anglican Church).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Walter is reported to have been one of the first trustees and, according to the Chaleur history, cut the first lumber to start the building. It is a small church with 8-10 pews on each side.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The names of Mr. and Mrs. Walter Glendenning are included on a plaque in memory of the early church families.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>(Mr. and Mrs. John Glendenning's names are also included)</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Walter lived in Canobie and was active in community affairs. In 1882 he was one of the people responsible for turn piking a new road into the Springfield Settlement.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He was also a successful mixed farmer.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>According to his will, on his death, he owned:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>"	Lot No. 30, Canobie, the old homestead, formerly surveyed for Charles Scott. But transferred to John Glendinning and from John Glendinning to his son Walter.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>"	100 acres in Canobie, which I believe to be Lot #28, which he left to his wife, Elizabeth.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It appears that my father, Elmer, bought this land originally and then sold (?) it to his father.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This was likely the lot where Uncle Chip lived.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>"	the Stevens Farm in Canobie containing 100 acres which he left to, Elizabeth, with the proviso that it be transferred to his son Raymond if he returned to settle in Canobie. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>"	50 acres, the original Taylor Farm, which was left to his wife Elizabeth.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This property is immediately west of and adjoins the Stevens farm.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Apparently this land was left to or purchased by his daughter. Venetia.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Guy Glendenning said that Venetia sold the property to Matt. Ellis</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Walter Glendenning developed pneumonia and died while visiting his daughter, Venetia Doring (and other family members) who were living in Falmouth Foreside near Portland Maine at the time. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>(Sons Elmer, Chipman, Ray, and Frank who ran a woods operation in New Hampshire).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>His will was written on January 6, 1908 just five weeks before he died.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>After his death, his wife, Elizabeth, went to live with her daughter Venetia in Falmouth, Foreside, Maine. She died there on May 14, 1915. Both are buried in the Presbyterian cemetery in New Bandon. NB <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>(Brother, John and wife, Ellen are also buried in that Cemetery.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The cemetery is still maintained although the church has long since disappeared. Thanks to the Portland Library, for the following death notice which appeared<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>in the Portland Evening Express on Feb. 15, 1908:</p>

<p>Bay of Chaleur Forgotten Treasures by A. J. McCarthy tells the following story (pp115-116)</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>	"Another family feud that ended in a death occurred on April 27, 1916, in the remote settlement of Canobie.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>At</p>
<p>	midnight, a boy and his mother were a wakened by a loud rapping on their cabin door.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When Sarah Peters peered from<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>	her window and recognized the intruder at her door as a troublesome neighbour, John McCarthy, she bade him to leave<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>	at once.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The deranged man, 	who had made threats against the Peters on many occasions, commenced to<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>break their</p>
<p>	cabin windows and violently yelled, 'I'll kill the whole damn bunch of you'.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>	For some time the shadowy figure skulked about their property.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The family dog<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>was<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>sent out to run him off, but to no avail. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>	Finally when McCarthy went to the barn where the animals were Sept, and appeared with their mare by the halter, Mrs Peters<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>	summoned her son, Bedford, to get the shotgun.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The boy, clothed only in his underwear, fired a warning shot from the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>	window, then proceeded outside in the pouring rain to confront McCarthy.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>another warning shot was fired but McCarthy<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>	became more threatening.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He produced a knife, and lunging toward the boy, yelled, ' Get ready to die, I am going to murder you." <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>	Another warning shot was fired<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>and the family dog ferociously attacked the menacing intruder.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>	Fearing for her son's life, Mrs Peters yelled, "or God's sake fire!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He is going to murder us.'<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Just as McCarthy was upon him<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p>The following obituary was taken from the Florida Advocate dated May 29, 1936.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Robinson Doring Dies at Bowling Green Home</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Robinson L. Doring, 72, died at his residence west of Bowling Green on Wednesday after a lengthy illness.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He was born in Perry, Maine April 24, 1864.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Moving to Bowling Green in 1915, from Portland, Me., the deceased had lived there until his death.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Mr. Doring followed hydro-electric powerhouse, dam and paper mill construction as an engineer and general construction superintendent until retiring in 1930 at his Bowling Green home.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>His largest construction jobs were the Stevens Creek dam and powerhouse across the Savannah River above Augusta, Georgia; a large dirt dam and canal irrigation system in Idaho, and the construction during the World War in Amatol, N. J. of the most complete and largest ammunition loading plant and town site in the United States.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Survivors are his widow, Mrs. Venetia G. Doring; a daughter, Miss Verna Elizabeth; two sons, Walter G. and John S. Doring all of Bowling Green, and two sisters, Mrs. Charles Shaw of Perry, Me., and Miss Jessie Doring, supervisor of …(Unable to read last paragraph)</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Funeral services were conducted from the residence of the deceased yesterday afternoon at 3 o'clock under the direction of Coker's Funeral Home, of this city, with Rev. J.F. Clark, of Bowling Green officiating.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Interment was in Bowling Green cemetery with the Masonic Order in Charge.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I decided to check out Amatol, New Jersey and found that construction of a plant and a town site for 10,000 people commenced in March, 1918 and was completed in 9 months.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The only one of the original buildings still standing is the former barracks of the New Jersey State Police on White Horse Pike.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There was a major explosion at the plant on July 10, 1926 but fortunately it was a Saturday and few men were at work.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I do not know if there was any rebuilding but, according to what I read, the town soon disappeared.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Fascinating story !<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Bobby Glendenning told me that his father, Guy Glendenning, worked with bob Doring on the construction of a dam/bridge in upper New York State.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>It appears that Bob Doring's ancestors on both sides were United Empire Loyalists who came first to Nova Scotia, then moved to NB and later settled in Maine.</p>

<p><br></p>
<p><span>Notes for E</span>LMER<span> A</span>LTON<span> G</span>LENDENNING<span>:</span></p>
<p>Elmer, the second child and first son to Walter and Elizabeth (Peters) Glendenning, was born in Canobie on land that is now a grove of trees directly across the road from the Canobie School, now the Women's Institute Hall. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Baptismal record shows birthdate as June 10, 1875</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>It is likely that he went to the one room school on a corner of his Uncle's farm next door since the family seems to have valued education; this is not surprising in that his grandmother was a teacher and lived in the home until Elmer was 20.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As further evidence, his brother, Chip took a business course, Guy studied but did not finish dentistry and Margaret trained as a nurse.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is likely that Dad took some technical courses while in Portland; I remember some engineering books at home.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>His oldest sister, Venetia, provided a home for his sister, Margaret, so that she could finish high school in Portland; I believe that Uncle Guy also completed high school there; maybe others did as well. <span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Elmer's father was a farmer and, judging by the amount of land accumulated, a successful one at that.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Elmer, and all the boys, and maybe even the girls, would be expected to do their share.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The land would have to be cleared of trees, and those who know Canobie, will remember the stony fields; and all the work would be done by hand or with the aid of horses.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>At that time he probably knew people, even friends, who went to Maine or New Hampshire during the winter to work in the woods and then return to farm and fish in the summer; he may have even done that himself. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The Glendennings were well established in Portland in the first decade of the 1900s. Frank moved there in 1898 and Elmer by 1901. Venetia, the oldest child, seems to have played the role of "host" as each new family member moved south.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Venetia lived in Falmouth Foreside which is between Portland and Freeport.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Other siblings known to have lived in Portland, at least for a while, include Margaret, Raymond and Guy. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In addition, Maude and her husband, Jim Cormier lived in Lincoln, New Hampshire where Uncle Jim Cormier worked in the mill, and Leonard and his family lived in Maine.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We also know, for example, that his Aunt, Mary Ann (Harley) who had married a Stevens and lived next door in Canobie, had moved to Portland to be with family after her husband died in 1870. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Land grant records show that Lot # 28 in Canobie, 100 acres, was granted to Atton E. Glendenning on 1901-07-06.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Prior to his marriage in 1910, we know that Elmer, his brother, Frank, and likely brothers Ray and Guy operated a trucking business under the name Glendenning Bros. &amp; Co. (All Kinds of Team Work) at 24 Hammond Street. They had horses and wagons and did all kinds of hauling.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Portland was the winter terminus of the Great Northern Railway, later the CNR, which meant that much goods would be moved, in all kinds of combinations, from trains, ships to warehouses, retail stores and homes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>One role Dad told about was that of delivering ice to homes. Elmer also had crews of men and horses in the woods in<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>winter, we believe in both Maine and new Hampshire, but possibly also in Vermont.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Other people from Black River worked with him including his brother-in-law, James A. Watling<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>and Ramsay MacLean (a nephew of Adam MacLean who was married to Elmer's first cousin. Millie.)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>According to Herbert Daley, Herb Daley, Dad's first cousin, also worked in the woods with Elmer. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>In the first decade of the 20th century, Elmer and his brothers operated a cartage business in Portland, Maine.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I believe that his brother, Frank, was a partner in the business and others may have been as well.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Bobby Glendenning believes said that his father, Guy, worked in the business and brother Ray worked with them as a blacksmith.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>By 1910, Elmer was working on the Rothschild dam in Wausau, Wisconsin from where, on January 25, 1910, he mailed "Jeannie Glendenning" in Portland; some dams were being built to improve the rafting of logs; others were built for the generation of power. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Elmer and Jane were married in Litle Branch in 1910 and returned to Portland, however, by February 1911 they were living in Parksville, Tennessee where Elmer worked on Ocoee #1, the first of three dams build on the Ocoee River. Later Mum and Dad moved up the Ocoee River to Caney Creek where a second dam was built.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>(This project included the construction of a flume line to carry water for five<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>miles over valleys and along rocky ledges to a head pond with a drop of 250 feet to the turbines below.)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The flume line is still in existence and designated as a national historic site.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Over the next few years they moved from construction site to construction site in Hampton, Virginia, Mussel Shoals. Alabama, North haven, Connecticut, <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Dad also worked for a while in Abiline, Texas but I do not believe that Mum moved there. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Probably the other major project was in Virginia where Elmer was in charge of the clearing of Langley Field which, I believe, handled both sea and land based airplanes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was a defense establishment and, I believe they lived on th site; people needed passes when returning to the site; Venetia's pass was for 1918, I do not know the year of Lillian's pass.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Dad worked in Mussell Shoals likely either at the Wilson Dam or at the nearby nitrate plant.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>At the same time, we have evidence that Uncle Frank worked at Plant No. 1, US Nitrate Co. in Sheffield Alabama.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He was working<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>for the J. G. White Engineering Co, which is the same one Dad worked for in Hampton, Virginia.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>On July 21, 1914, Elmer bought the Jessie MacDonald property at Little Branch<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>and they move there during late 1913 or early 1914<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>(The property passed from Jessie to her nephew, Alexader from whom Dad made the purchase) <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Elmer beame post master in 1914 but resigned in 1916 and moved to Fairhaven, Connecticut where they lived at 3 Perkins Street.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>By 1919, they took up permanent residence at their home in Little Branch.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Over the years he purchased a number of other properties, one for each of his sons.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Like others in Black River, they operated a mixed farm that included cows, pigs, hens, geese, horses, turkeys; crops included a farm garden, oats, barley, wheat, buckwheat, and hay.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Cash was scarce; most of their business was accomplished thriugh barter of eggs, chickens,, beef, pork, the sale of weaners (Piglets four to six weeks old), geese, turkeys, ducks, bales of hay, bags of grain, cream, potatoes, furnace wood, and butter, etc.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In addition, the<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>farm ensured that the family had meat and potatoes for their own use.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>For a while he had a team of oxen which he used around the farm.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Lillian remembers using them to haul sap from back on the "ridge".</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Elmer active in the community including the building of St. Paul's Presbyterian Church (on June 14, 1926 was elected to the first Board of Managers) , was a prime mover in the construction of a community hall.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The first hall was opened in 1931 and burned to the ground in 1932.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A second hall was built in 1933.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He was active in the Orange Lodge, Oddfellows, and Masons.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>In addition to farming, he and his brother-in-law, John W. MacNaughton operated a pulp business. They operated a "rosser", a machine for peeling pulp in Middle Black River, across from the Cameron School, and operated lumber camps in St. Margaret's and the Black River area.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He continued to be active in construction and built the bridge at John Godfrey's and John Dick's. His last job away from home was the construction of Tinker Dam near Woodstock, NB</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Elmer Glendenning was known as a hard worker. He built and repaired his own harness, re-soled the children's shoes, and made axe handles. Even when he was not able to work, Brydone Weeks told that Dad had himself taken to the field in a wheelbarrow where he sharpened the scythes while the men were cutting marsh hay.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Dad suffered for a number of years with pernicious anaemia (or was it leukemia ?).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Walter remembers the wagon rack breaking one evening when coming from the woods with a load of wood.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Later he and Dad returned to the woods, unloaded the wood, cut poles, repaired the wagon rack, and returned home so that the wagon load of wood was ready to be taken to Loggieville the next day.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Part of the repair work was carried out by the light of a lantern.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Lillian remembers Dad up on the roof shingling at daybreak. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Dad was a founding member of an Agricultural Society (#103) and was its Secretary Treasurer for fourteen years.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>An Agricultural Society, and there were many throughout the Province,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>was like a Co-op.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Farmers banded together and bought seeds, lime and fertilizer, etc. in bulk and sold it to themselves</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>It is interesting that Dad's name sometimes appears as Alton Elmer and other times as Elmer Alton Glendenning.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Although I have not seen a birth certificate, my earliest references are to Elmer Alton Glendenning. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Venetia's clippings included the following believed to have been taken from the Moncton Times:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>"CHATHAM,May 22 - The community of Black River and the Miramichi generally will learn with deep regret of the death of Elmer A.

<p><span>Notes for J</span>ANE<span> E</span>LIZABETH <span>J</span>ARDINE<span> W</span>ATLING<span>:</span></p>
<p>Jane was the second youngest of a family of eight born to Jubal Watling and Grace (MacAskill) MacDonald, born, presumably at home, at the Meadows, Upper Black River, New Brunswick.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She was named after Jane Elizabeth Jardine , daughter of John Jardine, (1836-1912)who married Donald Cameron (Cameron Russell's grandmother)</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>When she was about 10 years old, the family moved from the Meadows to Little Branch.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She attended the Upper Black River school and later the school at Little Branch.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Jane arrived in Portland on January 24, 1908 just prior to her 18th birthday. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Jane arrived in the early morning of January 24, 1908 and waited for her brother, George, to meet her. Apparently he came to the station but did not recognize her. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She had grown up while he was away from Black River.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Her brother Jack also worked in Portland at that time and likely there were many cousins. We also know that her brother Jim worked in Portland in a chemist/pharmacy, and also in photography, but whether he was there at that time we do not know. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Among Mum's possessions was an envelope, addressed in Dad's handwriting and mailed from Wisconsin, showing Mum's address as 130 Emery Street, Portland.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>She married Elmer Glendenning on October 18, 1910 and returned to the US where they lived and worked for the next nine years; .Information about this period is found in the notes about Elmer.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>In Black river, Jane was active in her church, the Women's Missionary society and the Women's league.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She was also a long time member of the women's institute.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She liked to read and, in the early years at least, wrote poetry.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>After 28 years of marriage, Jane Elizabeth Jardine (Watling) became a widow in 1939; she was 48 at the time.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The two oldest daughters, Grace and Venetia, were married and living elsewhere; her daughter, Lillian, was living and working in the Boston area.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Elinor and the five boys, the youngest being nine years old, were living at home.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The next decade, the wartime years, brought a number of significant changes to the community.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The commencement of classes, and the construction of the Miramichi Rural High School, allowed young people of the community to continue their schooling to the end of high school while continuing to live at home; before this, the nearest high school was in Loggieville, eleven miles away.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The looming war resulted in the construction of an airbase at Chatham, a radar station at St. Margaret's, and a bombing range on the road to Loggieville.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>These developments meant a significant growth of non-farm jobs for the community.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The outbreak of hostilities also soon resulted in sons, sons-in-law, neighbours, relatives and friends entering the armed forces.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The decade also brought improved roads, regular bus service to Chatham and electric lights.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>By the end of the decade, Black River had moved from a barter to a cash economy.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Although the sons continued to operate the family farm for the next decade, the decade also brought significant changes to the family;<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Walter finished building his house on the Dan MacLean property, married and moved out; Lillian returned to New Brunswick and married; Elinor, Kenneth, Norman and Don attended the new Miramichi High School; Walter, Kenneth and Norman served in the armed forces; John, after operating the farm during the war, married, built a house and moved to the Bob MacLean property; Elinor married and moved out; Kenneth returned from military service, married and moved away; Don finished high school and entered teaching; Norman married and settled on the home place. <span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Jane continued to be active in the community generally and encouraged her family and others to do the same.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She was especially active in her church, the Women's Missionary Society, the Presbyterian League and the Women's Institute.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She believed in education and supported the construction of a high school for the area; she also encouraged her family and others to continue their schooling. (It is interesting to note that the Miramichi Rural High School was the first rural high school in the Province; immediately following WW2, the number grew rapidly with, I believe, federal financial support, until there were approximately 50 rural high schools throughout the New Brunswick.)<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Norman and Jean married in 1951 and Mum continued to live with them until she died in 1964. Mum died in the Miramichi Hospital of cancer of the pancreas having been in the hospital only about two weeks. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The following vignettes are intended to round out the picture of Mother, her interests, activities and passions:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>1	While discussing VE Day with Vance MacNaughton in June of 1995 at the shopping mall in Douglastown, he told Ken and I about his memory of VE Day (May 8, 1944).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As readers will know, the Little Branch School was down the road and across the brook from home.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Vance was a student in the school at the time when, suddenly, there was a knock and, without waiting for a response, the door flew open the school door flew open and Mum announced to teacher and students alike "The War is over". <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>2	Mother had no formal training as a nurse but made herself available and was frequently called upon by others in the community in time of need such as for a birth or death in a family. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>3	Her " pin money" came from trading wool for yarn.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The wool was wash in rainwater heated on the kitchen stove, carried to the front yard, washed and rinsed several times and spread on the grass to dry then gathered up and bagged.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>down into the grass and, therefore, being difficult to gather and bag when dry. The bags wool were loaded into the Model A Ford and taken to Brown's Woolen Mills in Nelson where it would be made into yarn.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She bartered her wool for skeins of yarn in colours, but mostly in white or grey. She knitted mitts and socks for the family, and sometimes for Christmas gifts, and sold surplus yarn to neighbours and, I think, she had some customers by mail.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>4	Bread was a staple and a large family required many loaves of bread each week.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The recipe was mixed in a large, round blue-enamelled, bread pan.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A cake of Fleischmann's yeast was "started" in a cup of warm water.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The dough was made into loaves, set in a warm place to rise, and then put in the oven to bake.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My recollection is that she would make 7 loaves at a time twice a week. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>5	Mother loved to have visitors.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There were a half-dozen at every meal and putting up a meal for 15 after church on Sunday, or any other day, did not faze her a bit or if it did, she did not let on.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I cannot ever even once remember her saying, I wish they hadn't or wouldn't come today.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Meals were not fancy but they were always tasty.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Of course, when the visitors were family, the daughters or daughters-in-law, pitched in to help.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>6	Oil lamps were tended early each day so that, when night fell, there was no scramble for a light.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We had three oil lamps plus, in later years, an Aladdin lamp.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Lamps were filled with kerosene, wicks were trimmed, globes were wiped first with an old newspaper to remove the soot, then washed, dried and replaced.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When finished, the kerosene lights were placed on a shelf beside the clock high on the kitchen wall. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The Aladdin lamp used gas, naphtha?, and did not require such daily care.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>7	Securing food for the coming winter was a major concern in a household.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>While Mother had no special role in the planting or harvesting, she played the major role in pressuring food for winter.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The first step was to have a good garden, which resulted in potatoes, carrots and turnips stored in bins in the basement.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Carrots were a bit more complex and were usually stored in sand in the basement.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Apples were stored in a cold bedroom, usually the large bedroom over the driveway.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Some preserves were put up - peaches, cucumber pickles, chow and mustard beans.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Several baskets of peaches were purchased and these were bottled along with some strawberries, blueberries and maybe even raspberries. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>St. Stephen's Presbyterian Church annual report for 1910 includes the following:</p>
<p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>"GLENDENNING-WATLING - At the home of the bride's parents, on October 18, Alton Elmer Glendenning of Bathurst and Jane Elizabeth Watling of Little Branch".</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I have the following clipping, date and newspaper unknown:</p>
<p><br></p>

<p><span>Notes for J</span>OHN<span> F</span>RANKLIN<span> G</span>LENDENNING<span>:</span></p>
<p>Baptismal records show birthdate as April 19, 1877; single and living with his Uncle Henry Stevens in; according to 1910 census, he came to Portland in 1898; Lillian's notes gives Uncle Frank's address in 1935 as 72 Wilmot Street, Portland, Maine</p>
<p>Operated a cartage business from 18 Hammond St, Portland; likely worked in woods in New Hampshire; Portland was a very busy rail terminal for traffic from Montreal.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I remember Dad leaving for the funeral with his Gladstone bag.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Thanks to Robert Stevens, a Harley descendant and cousin, I learned that Uncle Frank went to Portlant in 1898, and, in the year 1900 he was a teamster and boarding with his second cousin, Henry Stevens.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Robert also provided an undated registration form which shws him to be 41 years old, working as a labour foremen at at Plant No.1, Us Nitrate company in Sheffield, Alabama.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>His employer was the J. G White Engineering company, the same company Dad worked for in Virginia.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I am wondering now if Dad also worked on the construction of the Nitrate plannt rather than the Wilson Dam.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He listed his home address as 543 Forest Ave, Portland Maine</p>
<p><br></p>

<p><br></p>
<p>The death o£ James Cormier, Canobie, occurred July 4, at Chaleur General Hospital in Bathurst at the age of 92.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Born in Paquetvil1e, he was a .son of the late Phillip and Margaret (Brown.) Cormier.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Mr. Cormier was a well known farmer in Canobie for most of his lifetime.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>His wife, the former Maude Glendenning, died in 1956</p>

<p><br></p>
<p>Grandson, Walt Berry wrote "I always did enjoy a trip to my Grandparents home. I can remember the first time I took my wife and son to Canobie. Granddad went to the fishing pier and brought home a big mess of lobster. My wife (who is not from down there) said she was not going to eat the lobster - but grand dad broke them open for her and she did enjoy them. That would have been around 1970 or so as our son Mark was with us and as I recall he was about three or so. I can recall granddad sitting in his rocking chair in the front porch of their large farm home - smoking his pipe of Prince Albert.</p>

<p><span>Notes for G</span>RACE<span> E</span>LIZABETH<span> G</span>LENDENNING<span>:</span></p>
<p>Lillian said that Grace attended Armstrong School in Parksville, Tenn</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Grace was the oldest in the family and was born in Parksville, Tennessee.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Dad and Mum had set up housekeeping there in February 1911 where Dad worked on Ocoee #1, the first of three dams build on the Ocoee River.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Aunt Janet had journeyed to Parksville to be with Mum when Grace was born. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>When Grace was young, Dad and Mum moved from construction site to construction site in the US and, presumably, Grace attended school wherever she was; one school was the Armstrong School but I am not sure if it was in Connecticut or Virginia.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The family returned to NB in 1919 and, again, presumably Grace attended the Little Branch School.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Later she attended Success Business College in Moncton, NB where she took a business program.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>While she made good marks, apparently she did not like the program.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was when returning from Business College with Grace, that Dad upset the Model T at Gilbert's Corner, near Shediac.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Grace broke her wrist but even so, went to a dance in the Little Branch School that night.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Like so many other Maritimers, Grace went to Boston to work, probably in 1930 and worked for various families caring for children and likely cooking.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>. On her first trip, she traveled with Mrs. F. A. Fowlie and Ernest MacLean who were going to Lowell, Mass to visit relatives.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She may have she stayed for a while with Dad's cousin, Sam Knowles.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>At one time she lived at 1595 Beacon Street, Beverley, Mass. She frequently visited her Uncle Jack Watling in Boston and later when he lived on Swan's Island near Eastport, Maine.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Grace returned regularly to Little Branch for the summer coming sometimes by steamer from Boston to Saint John, NB.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>(I believe that the fare to Saint John was $10.00)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In 1947, when I left home for Teachers' College in Fredericton, I inherited Grace's steamer trunk - and it carried my belongings on a number of later trips.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>As a young woman in Little Branch and later in Boston, Grace loved to square dance; Lillian said that the night she landed in Boston in 1933, she went to a dance with Grace.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Perhaps that is where she met Roy Morrison Smith (1908-1985). <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Roy, I believe, preferred to round dance. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She and Roy were married in St. Paul's Presbyterian Church on August 26, 1936.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In 1936, Walter, Dad, Elinor and I drove to Boston to bring Grace home.<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>After marriage, Grace and Roy lived with Roy's mother in Saugus, Mass, later moving to 23 Spring Street in Malden. While in Saugus, Grace worked for Chisholm's Motel on Route 1. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>One evening while standing on the sidewalk near her home in Malden talking to a neighbour, a man came along, knocked her off her feet and stole her purse. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Grace, Roy and family were frequent visitors to Little Branch and even when they could not come, their children made the trip.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My recollection is that Barbara and Lawrence spent 16 consecutive summers with their Grandmother at Little Branch.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Often they came by train but also frequently traveled with expatriate New Brunswick folk who were visiting family in the Miramichi.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I can remember being wakened in the middle of the night when Grace arrived home.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She had brought some clothes for me and wanted to see them on me.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The story is told that one summer when Grace was home and helping with the cooking and Ken was a toddler, Grace would jam Ken's dress in the pantry door in order to keep him out of her way.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In later years, Grace frequently landed home carrying shopping bags with fresh tomatoes from Roy's garden, bagels for Jean MacKenzie and the usual things for family members. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Grace had extraordinary eyesight. While walking through a field she could reach down and pick a four leaf clover. One time she entered a contest, which required her to count the dots in a picture of a TV.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She won, and then decided she should count the dots again in case she was asked the number at the presentation ceremony.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I know that she also won other contests but cannot recall which ones.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As a youngster, I can recall going with Grace and others to pick blueberries and raspberries and of walking through the fields.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I am not sure if we were going somewhere or just for a walk.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Although she left New Brunswick as a young woman, she did not lose interest in family, friends or the community.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She subscribed to the Chatham Gazette for many years and was well informed about activities among her extended family. She was proud of her family, fiercely loyal, generous to a fault and she and Roy always welcomed and provided shelter for the many visiting family members.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She was quick to arrange for visitors to see the Museum of Science, visit down town Boston, see the Saugus Iron works, etc. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>During her later years Grace had a form of multiple sclerosis and had difficulty walking.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She then moved to Cliffside Nursing Home and Winthrop, Mass.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She is buried in the Black River Cemetery.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The Moncton times of August 10, 1991 carried the following:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>"Mrs. Grace E Smith, 80 of Malden, Mass., and formerly of Black River Bridge, died Thursday in Malden following a lengthy illness.</p>
<p>Born in Blalck River Bridge, she wqas a daughter of the late Elmer A. and Jane (Watling) Glendenning.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She was a former member of St. Paul's Presbyterian Church, Black river Bridge.</p>
<p>She is survived by one daughter, Mrs John Coppla (Barbara) of Malden; one son, Lorne, of Malden; two sisters, Mrs Bydeone Weelss (Lillian) of Stanley, and Mrs. Cameron russell (Venetia)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>of Pt. au Cair, four brothers, Walter of Moncton, Kenneth of Centre Napan, Norman of Black River Bridge and Dr. Donald of Charlottetwon, P.E.I.; seven granndchildren and a number of nieces and nephews.</p>
<p>She was predeceased by her husband, Roy, in 1985 and by a brother, Joh</p>
<p>The body is at Adams Funeral Home, Chatham.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Funeral arrangements will be announced.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Interment will be in Black River Cemetery."</p>

<p><span>Notes for W</span>ALTER<span> J</span>UBAL<span> G</span>LENDENNING<span>:</span></p>
<p>Walter was born in New Brunswick; Mother had come back from Tennessee to New Brunswick for his birth and may have stayed in NB until late 1916 - we do not know for sure. The family returned permanently to Little Branch in 1919 and it is likely that is where Walter started school -.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is likely that he only went to school for 6-8 years and then would have worked with Dad on the farm.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Walter did not talk much about his early years but I know that he worked long hours both summer and winter.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Because Dad was such a worker and Walter was the oldest boy in the family, I am sure that a great deal was expected of him.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He had a team of dogs, Chowder and Pup, which he hitched to a sled in winter and traveled around the community, and cross to visit Alex Newton.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Once he took Dad across to George Adams' to use the phone. The longest trip, Walter said, was to John W. MacNaughton's - a distance of about 7 miles. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Canobie and Black River Glendenning family members kept in touch and visited back and forth. One time, the Christmas, 1938 I believe, Walter was taking family members to Chatham in the Model A.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The right front window was broken and was replaced with a piece of cardboard.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Seems to me that Mum, Ken, Norm, Lillian and I were in the car.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As we neared the railroad tracks, Walter spotted a train approaching from the right.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He tried to stop but the car kept sliding towards the tracks.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Quick thinking, he tramped on the gas instead and got across just ahead of the train.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>People on the back of Adams' truck just ahead of us were sure that we were going to be hit.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Walter began building a home on the Dan MacLean place in 1937 and moved into it on November 1, 1940.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In the meantime, they lived at Little Branch.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The basement was dug with the aid of a horse, Jess, and a scoop and most if not all of the lumber came from Hallidays.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The original barn on the property burned in 1932, the same year as the Black River Hall.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>His house was struck by lightning in 1940 but did not burn.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Although Walter farmed, he also worked off the farm.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In 1940 he worked at clearing the bombing range along the Loggieville Road.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He was called to the Army Service Corps during the war and was stationed at Ottawa, Halifax, Debert and Camp Borden.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>On his return, he continued to farm and to work at the airport.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In 1950 he commenced work with Modern Construction Co. Ltd. In 1959 he moved to Moncton and continued to work for Modern at job sites throughout New Brunswick including their head office in Moncton.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He retired in 1978.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Dad was one of the promoters of farmers working together and was Secretary Treasurer of the Agricultural Society #103.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Part of the role was to maintain a "store" from which seeds, etc. would be sold.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>After Dad died, Walter took over the role and moved the shed from the Branch to his place.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Walter and Agnes always welcomed visitors - family and friends alike - and they were good hosts.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A meal seemed to appear effortlessly and Walter encouraged visitors to "eat up and give the house a good name."<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He liked to travel and visit family and friends in Bathurst, Rexton, Harvey Station and down to the Boston area. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He also traveled widely stopping to see men he had worked with. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>For a while they owned a cottage Florina Beach near Cocagne, NB. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Walter is also remembered for his keen memory.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He seemed to remember anyone he ever worked with, perhaps even met, and would visit if he was passing nearby.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He enjoyed reminiscing but talked little about what himself. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Walter loved to visit the old home, "The Branch."<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A few years ago, when he was not able to drive, I arranged to pick him up for a day's outing.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When we got into the car I said, "We can go any where you would like.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Would you like to go to the Island?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Saint John? Fredericton? Springhill? Or where?"<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He hesitated only for a moment then said, "I think that I'd like to go to the Branch".<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>.</p>

<p><span>Notes for V</span>ENETIA<span> K</span>ATHERINE<span> G</span>LENDENNING<span>:</span></p>
<p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Venetia was born at Little Branch.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Mum and Dad were living in Little Branch at the time.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Venetia attended the Little Branch School for Grades 1-8, the highest grade available in the Little Branch School, and then she<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>stayed with Aunt Tine in Loggieville where she completed Grade nine.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Following that, she wrote Entrance Exams and gained First Class Entrance to the Provincial Normal School from which she graduated in 1933.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As I recall, Venetia taught in New Carlysle, Napan, Penniac and Bayside; she may also have taught somewhere north of Fredericton.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She also taught in Point Aux Carr, Little Branch, Miramichi Rural High School and Chatham retiring in 1975.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Quite a number of people at her wake mentioned that Venetia had been their teacher.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Venetia was active in her church, St. Paul's Presbyterian.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She probably attended Sunday school at St. Stephen's Presbyterian Church prior to it becoming St. Stephen's United Church.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When St. Paul's opened in 1930, there was a PYPS rally prior to the church opening. And Venetia was President of the Young Peoples Society.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The local paper, presumably the Chatham Gazette, noted, "Miss Venetia Glendenning, President Black River Y.P.S, in a very pleasing manner welcomed the delegates…" Venetia was a member of St. Paul's since its establishment, played the organ for many years and for 40 years was Church Treasurer.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She was also a member of the Women's Missionary Society and the Women's League.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Venetia met Cameron Russell (1906-1979) in the spring of 1932 at Little Branch.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Cam was rafting logs for Harrison Murdoch and they tied up at the wharf.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Cam and perhaps other members of the crew came over to talk to the girls in the schoolyard.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They married in St. Paul's Presbyterian Church and lived in Point Aux Carr in a home they bought from Mrs. Simon MacDonald.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Mrs. MacDonald retained a room which she used mainly in the summer.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Cam and Venetia had three children, Glenn, Leonard and Donna.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Venetia was an avid reader, a good listener and a good sport.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She was a good conversationalist but not one to gossip or be critical of others.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She demanded nothing, asked little and offered much.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She did not complain and was always "fine" when asked about her own health.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She did not want to bother people.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She could entertain herself and did not mind living alone.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In fact, she lived alone for 20 years after she became a widow.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Venetia was a resource for information about her community and we shared an interest in genealogy; she provided me with much of my initial information about the Watling side of the family.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She could recall family relationships from memory whereas I have to rely on my notes and records.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Venetia and Cam had many trips to Florida with Ken and Verne.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When lighting her stove to warm the house on return from one trip in 1989 or 1990, the house caught fire and burned.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She rebuilt on the same site.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Venetia and Cam visited Donna and Vernon when they lived in Vancouver and later in England and, while in England, traveled with the family by car around Europe. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>As a youngster, I recall the nice table Venetia set at mealtime.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A visit to Venetia's always ended in lunch before leaving.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Sometimes when visiting the Miramichi in recent years, I would drop in on Venetia's about 8:00 am and enjoy toast, jam, tea and conversation.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She kept scotch cookies in her freezer and always set some out when she knew I was coming for a visit.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Venetia boarded with Archie MacKay in Fredericton while attending Normal School.</p>
<p>The web site of Adams Funeral Home of January 16, 2003 included the following:</p>
<p>"Mrs Venetia K. Russell</p>

<p>Born in Black River Bridge, she was the daughter of the late Elmer A, and Jane (Watling) Glendenning.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She was a teacher by profession; a member of the N.B. Retired Teaches Assoc., a life member of the Miarmichi Teachers Assoc.; a member of St. Pauls Presbyterian Church, Black River Bridge; a former treasurer of that church, for 40 years as well as a former organist; a member of the Missionary Society; as well as a well known community historian.</p>

<p><span>Notes for L</span>ILLIAN<span> E</span>LSPETH<span> G</span>LENDENNING<span>:</span></p>
<p>Lillian was born at 3 Perkins St., Fairhaven, Conn., USA, where Dad was working at the time.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She would have traveled with the family to Hampton, Virginia and Muscle Shoals, Alabama before returning to Little Branch in 1919.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She attended Little Branch School for a few years but admitted that she did not like school. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>In school, students required a slate cloth and water to main clean slates.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Once Lillian dropped her slate cloth and instead of picking it up, tied the ankle of the student in front of her to the leg of the desk.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When the teacher called the girl to come to the board, the slate cloth tripped her.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Dad was returning from Moncton; Lillian was with him and maybe others.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Near Rexton, a car tried to run him off the road.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Lillian thought that they were rumrunners but perhaps the rum was inside them rather than just in the car.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Dad pulled in to a store/gas station and phoned the RCMP.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A police car came from Newcastle.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Lillian remembered riding in the police car as far as John W. MacNaughton's.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Lillian was a close friend of Maxine Macdonald and they used to visit back and forth.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>One of Mum's tricks was to ask Lillian to take a note over to Maxine's mother.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She dutifully carried the noted a half-mile to Maxine's place.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She did not know it at the time, but the note simply said "Please send Lillian home after a while."</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>At age 16, Lillian was glad to go to Boston to work.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Ken remembers the phone call from her sister, Grace, who was living on Beacon Street at the time, saying that there was a job for her in Boston; Walter took Mum, Venetia and Lillian to catch the train at Newcastle.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She arrived in Boston on September 22, 1933 and, I think, stayed with Dad's cousin, Sam Knowles, for a while.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That night, she went to a dance with Grace and Roy to celebrate Grace's 22nd birthday. (Dates don't quite match)</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>While in Boston, Lillian did housework and looked after children first for Mrs. Fineberg, who was a singer, and later for Mrs. Piser.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Her last employer was Mrs. Walker where she worked for 5-6 years.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>One of her addresses was "61 Mayo Avenue, Needham."</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Brydone and Lillian met on April 18, 1933 while Lillian was visiting with Aunt Tine in Loggieville.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There was a service in the United Church and afterward the young people played badminton.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Brydone walked Lillian back to Aunt Tine's.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They courted for over 6 years.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Lillian came home most summers but Brydone also visited her in Boston.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In 1936, Brydone and Walter traveled to Boston by train stopping to visit in Portland on the way.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Brydone and his mother drove Lillian back to Boston in 1936 after Grace's wedding.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I can remember Brydone coming to court Lillian in his Dad's car (a 1935 Ford perhaps); I would hang around the front door and as they got into the car.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Occasionally, Brydone would invite me to get in and go for a ride.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Sometimes the ride would include a trip to the "Bayshore" and end with a cone of ice cream.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Lillian and Kenneth Brydone Weeks (July 6, 1917 - Sept 16, 1994) were married at Little Branch on December 22, 1939. by Rev. P. McK. Sampson, Minister of the Sunny Corner Presbyterian Church and they lived in Loggieville.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Shortly after, Brydone enlisted in the North Shore Regiment.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Lillian lived for a while in Woodstock, and Sussex as well as Camp Borden.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She and the family lived in Loggieville (13 Church Lane?) while Brydone was overseas.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Lillian was a people person.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She was active in her church.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She enjoyed company, was a great conversationalist and enjoyed both hearing and telling jokes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Although she did not play any musical instrument she often sang while working around the house.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She also sang in the choir and I can still hear her singing The Old Rugged Cross.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Lillian, Brydone and daughter, Patricia, frequently led special church services with readings and song.</p>
<p>Lillian was a note-maker.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She maintained a record of dates of events from her community and from Black River.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In 1974-75, Lillian typed 144 pages of memories of her early years.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In 1995, I arranged for them to be printed and she gave copies to family and a few close friends.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Among other things, Lillian remembered visiting Bird Hill to observe the "Zepplin", a German dirigible pass on its way to New York.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That is the dirigible famous for having burst into flames while moored in New Jersey.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Lillian went to Boston on on September 22, 1933 and returned to NB to live in September, 1939.</p>
<p>The Fredericton gleaner carried the following on October 25, 2000:</p>

<p>Brydone was born in Loggieville and graduated from the Loggieville High School.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>For a number of years he worked for A&amp;R Loggie Company delivering groceries and feed with one of his regular routes being Loggieville to Escuminac.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>People would phone in their orders and Brydone would deliver.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Once or twice he took me with him and bought lunch while in Escuminac.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was quite a treat.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Brydone always wanted to farm and after leaving the army purchased a dairy farm near Harvey Station.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Brydone was always active in his church and, in late 1964; Brydone accepted a call to minister in a three-point Presbyterian charge with a manse provided in Stanley; Lillian and Brydone lived there until their retirement.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>After Brydone retired, Lillian usually accompanied him when he substituted throughout Southern New Brunswick for ministers who were ill or on vacation.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>After Brydone died, Lillian moved to Harvey Station, then with Ken and Beverley but eventually moved into a senior's home in MacAdam.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Their homes in Harvey Station and in Stanley were favourite stopping places when traveling through to Boston - as well as just for family visits.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I frequently stayed there.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In fact, at Easter of 1955, I was visiting when Mum phoned one night to say a letter had arrived saying that I had won a Beaverbrook Overseas Scholarship. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p><br></p>
<p><span>Notes for J</span>OHN<span> F</span>RANKLIN<span> G</span>LENDENNING<span>:</span></p>
<p>John was born at Little Branch shortly after the family returned to Canada.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He attended the Little Branch School probably for 7 or 8 years, and then he worked on the farm.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Dad had not been well for a number of years so Walter and John did the farm work.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>John and Walter hauled fish from Hardwicke to Chatham, cut hardwood on the "ridge" and delivered it to Loggieville and Chatham.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>One day they would go to Hardwicke or Baie St. Anne (including Fred Savoie's) and bring fish back to the Branch; the next day, they delivered the fish to Chatham for $5.00 per ton (two box-sled loads).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They went to the woods and cut and split a cord of hardwood and the next day delivered it to Loggieville or Chatham for $5.00 including the cost of the wood.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>John worked hard and put in long hours.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He expected others to do their bit whether it was bringing in the wood for the stove, doing barn chores, going to the woods in winter, making hay in summer, etc.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was expected and you did it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But he was also very generous to people needing help. <span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>In the late 1930's John, along with some other young men from Black River including Tom Harper, Theodore Fowlie, took an agricultural course in Newcastle.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The course included practical farm mechanics, agriculture, book keeping, general mechanics and woodworking.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As part of the course, John made a beautiful birch desk, which he finished in walnut.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I also remember that he learned a new technique for killing chickens.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I believe that it was then or shortly thereafter, that John rigged up a wind generator on the roof of the barn which would charge a battery and provide light.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>One winter, November I believe, he and Brydone Weeks (Brydone was home on leave, probably before he went overseas) built a tractor out of an Oakland front end (a car that belonged to Alex MacDonald) and a Godferson rear end (a truck used by the A&amp;R Loggie Co) - and they did this in Walter's old shed without the aid of welding and cutting equipment (or heat). The tractor had two transmissions.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The tractor was very powerful but the too heavy for soft ground.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>During the winter of 1945-46, and perhaps winters previous to this, John, Ken and Norm all worked in the woods for Hubert Matchett of Sunny Corner.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They would be gone all week and I did the barn work.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>As a young lad going on 17, I went to work on the boats in Chatham loading pulp and pit props.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>(I am sure that I got my first job based on the reputation of John, Ken and Norm.)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>One day we were storing 8-foot props down in the hold.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They are heavy enough anyway but these were also moldy; I was struggling and John knew it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>John said, "Let me take that one, Donald".<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And it happened many times. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>For a number of years John went from farm to farm along the Miramichi pressing hay, first with a horse powered hay press but later with a press operated off a tractor.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>(When pressing hay at home, it was my job to keep the horse moving and to prevent it from grabbing at the hay when it went past the end of the bundle.)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Bundles of hay weighed between 80 to 120 pounds.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>John worked all around Black River, Napan, Barnaby River, Cains River, etc.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>For a number of years, John owned a 3-ton Dodge truck, which I believe he bought from Hubert Matchett, and trucked pulp, pit props, gravel, lime, fertilizer, hay and Christmas trees.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>In 1946-47 John and Mary built a new house on the Bob MacLean property and in the spring of 1948 opened a store in their living room.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In 1968 they built a new store nearer the road and put in gas tanks.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>John was very entrepreneurial selling groceries, flour, feed, plumbing, furnaces and anything else to make a buck.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>John received his call for military service and, I believe, went to Fredericton for a physical.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He had very poor eyesight and was turned down.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He probably would not have had to serve anyway, because farming was an essential service and he was needed at home.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Ken and Norm were already in the Service and I was too young to take over the responsibility of farming. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>When Ken and Norm were in the service, I was the only one around to help with the farm work.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Since Dad died when I was very young, you might say that I learned to work under John's direction.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I recall going to the woods in the winter, sitting on the bob-sled and on the load of wood on the way home, building loads of loose hay and poisoning potato bugs early in the morning to take advantage of heavy dew.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>John was the only one of the boys who would sing while driving to and from the fields or woods - I especially remember him singing familiar hymns.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Many of the older people in Black River will remember the 1939 Ford half-ton truck that, as I recall, John purchased from Bonnie Flanagan.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was a far cry from the old Model A.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The truck had wooden cab on the back and John would take people to town on Saturday night when the stores were open.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There could be a 10-12 people in the back.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I think that he charged one dollar.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The last thing before leaving town, he would drive up Water Street and past Ben's Canteen to see if anyone needed a lift home. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>John and Mary liked to visit family and friends around the Miramichi and Bathurst.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>John and Mary, with Margaret and Jeannie, made their first trip to Florida over Christmas of 1958.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Carol and I went with them to help with the driving.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Later, they managed to visit Florida for a month most winters always stopping to see family and friend in Florida and on the way.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When our children were small and we visited Black River, John always had gave the kids a candy or some change just as we were about to drive away.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I did not find an obituary, however, The Moncton Times of<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Monday, June 23, 1986 carried the following:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>"Black River Bridge couple beaten</p>
<p>Man dead, wife hurt in robbery</p>
<p>BLACK RIVER BRIDGE (Special)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>An elderly<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Black River Bridge man is dead and his wife is in serious but stable condition following what police suspect was a robbery attempt at the couple's home late Saturday.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>John F. Glendenning, a local grocer, was pronounced dead on arrival at hospital, while his wife, Mary, remains in stable condition<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>at Chatham's Hotelo Dieu Hospital.</p>
<p>Both are believed to have been victims of a beating by "several" persons.</p>
<p>Police are saying little about the attack, but confirm several persons were questioned late Sunday before<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>being released. Robbery is presumed to be the motive for the attack at this point of the investigation.</p>
<p>Mary Glendenning, 62, was apparently tied up by her assailants but managed to free herself to<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>telephone for help.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>No one else was in the house at the time.</p>
<p>The attack occurred sometime between 10 pm.and midnight Saturday.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The Glendenning's store adjacent to the house wasn't broken into, according to one family member.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Newcastle RCMP are being assisted by General Investigation Section officers from Moncton, RCMP subdivision.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Black River Bridge is about 10 miles from Chatham.</p>
<p>Born in Black River Bridge, Glendenning was the son of the late Elmer and Jane E. (Watling) Glendenning<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He was a grocer and farmer, a member of St. Paul's Presbyterian Church, Black River and an active member of the Black River Community Hall.</p>
<p>Besides his wife, the former Mary E. Watling of Point au Carr, he is survived by two daughters, Mrs. Aubrey Gibson (Margaret) of Black River Bridge, Mrs Ray Williston, (Jeannie)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>of Moncton; three sisters, Mrs Roy Smith (Grace) of Boston, Mass., Mrs Brydone Weeks (Lillian) of Harvey Station, Mrs Cameron Russell, (Venetia) of Point au Carr; four brothers, Walter of Moncton, Kenneth of Centre Napan, Norman of Black River Bridge, Dr. Donald of Charlottetown, P.E.I.; four grndchildren; several nieces and nephews.</p>
<p>The body will be at Adams Funeral Home, Chatham after 7 p.m. Tuesday.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Funeral service will be at St. Paul's Presbyterian Church at a day and time to be announced. Burial will be in Black River Cemetery".</p>

<p>Elinor, her Dad called her Nen, was born after the family returned to Canada; she attended the Little Branch School to the end of Grade 8.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She then wrote High School Entrance exams and attended high school classes in Bay du Vin. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>She usually walked to Bay du Vin, a distance of 5 miles, but sometimes rode her bicycle.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In the winter she boarded at Barbour Williston's.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>On a beautiful sunny day in early September, 1935, I walked with Elinor to my first day at school.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She wrote and passed her Junior Matriculation.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p>In the summer of 1949, Elinor and Earl and family moved to Black River.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Alex MacDonald had been killed in an accident and W. S. Loggie Company held the mortgage on his property.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Elinor turned over their house in Loggieville to Loggie's and paid the difference - $300.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I moved their belongings from Loggieville to Black River in the 1949 red Chev ½ ton truck.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>On one trip, we stopped to see Norm who was cutting grain in the field below John's house.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>As her family got older, Elinor did housework for a number of people in Chatham and at CFB Chatham.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She also worked at the Miramichi Seniors' Home in Chatham and at the Rehabilitation Centre.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Elinor was active in St. Paul's Presbyterian Church being a member of both the Women's League and the Presbyterian Missionary Society, a member of the Women's Institute and an active Member of the Black River Community Hall Committee.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The hall had burned and a new building was constructed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>(This was the second time that the Black River Hall had burned.).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She phoned me to tell me about the fire; a few days later she went into the hospital and died after a brief illness.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Once when having supper after a day digging potatoes, we were sitting at the dining room table.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Uncle Jim was there because it was the custom for neighbours to exchange labour while cutting wood, threshing, picking potatoes etc.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was dark so there was an oil lamp on the table.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Elinor went to reach across for butter and poked her knife through the lamp globe.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Of course, the flame went out as a result of the air rushing in.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Elinor wrote regularly when I was in England and her letters were always newsy.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>At Christmas of 1955 - my first Christmas away from home, I recall coming back to the residence late on Christmas day to find a letter waiting for me from Elinor.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>(Only in England would mail be delivered on Christmas day.)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She also wrote a letter every day to her son, Robert, when he lived in Toronto.</p>
<p>Elinor was a "high-energy" person - some may say it was a nervous energy.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She was a good worker, had a quick turn of mind, was fiercely loyal, and quick to support or defend family members.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She also had a temper.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Once when she was young, Mum sent the youngsters upstairs to make their Valentines.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>(Ken says that Jamie Mortimer and Ward Godfrey were at home at the time).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Elinor and Norm had a spat and Norm tried to take the scissors from her and cut his hand.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Elinor enjoyed hockey and was a fan of the Montreal Canadiens.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She was a good letter writer and wrote to her son, Robert, every day but two during the years he lived in Toronto.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I forget the reason for the first day she did not write but the second was the day she was admitted to the hospital just before she died. The following tribute was written by Mrs. Donald Angus MacDonald.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>To Elinor</p>
<p>Today I stood beside your silent bier,</p>
<p>Sweet fragrant flowers, tokens of esteem</p>
<p>Brought me thoughts of other days,</p>
<p>I see again your ready smile and kindly ways.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I feel your hand upon my arm</p>
<p>To aid me down the steps.</p>
<p>And see your keen and friendly interest</p>
<p>In every one you met.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>You gave yourself to every worthy cause.</p>
<p>Your untiring energy you could not stay,</p>
<p>Our whole community is a richer place</p>
<p>Since you have passed this way.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The Master called you to a higher post</p>
<p>But this is not the end,</p>
<p>We'll meet again, and you will know</p>
<p>How proud I am, that I have called you friend.</p>

<p>Earl had purchased a beautiful cream, chrome and red bicycle - double bars, handle bars and all.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was a far cry from the old bicycle which Walter had as a kid and which we, and half Black River, learned to ride on.

<p><span>Notes for K</span>ENNETH<span> E</span>LMER<span> G</span>LENDENNING<span>:</span></p>
<p>Ken attended the Little Branch School to the end of Grade 8, took classes in the Bay du Vin Hall and graduated from MRHS.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>One year he stayed with Venetia and Cam in Point Aux Carr, went to school, and did the chores while Cam fished smelts.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>After High school, Ken took a business course in Newcastle</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>In 1943, Ken enlisted in the RCAF; he phoned Mum from Moncton and, as I recall, Walter, Mum and I saw him at the Newcastle station when the train stopped briefly.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>His first posting was to Toronto for basic training then to Galt for technical training as an airframe mechanic; later postings included St. John's, Quebec and Scoudouc, New Brunswick.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He brought an airman from BC home for Christmas that first Christmas.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>After demobilization, he worked on the Miramichi including winters in the woods for Hubert Matchett and summers loading pulp and pit props on the boats.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>In 1948 he took a carpentry course in Moncton and, after doing carpentry work for a while, in 1950 he re-enlisted in the RCAF and his postings included Trenton, Calgary, Armstrong, Resolute, Moncton, Scoudouc, Greenwood, Ottawa and Chatham.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He retired from the air force 1984 after having a stroke.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>In October 1939, Ken and I both came down with scarlet fever a week apart.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I think the quarantine period was 6 weeks - a red warning sign was posted by the front door. We shared the bedroom on the ground floor.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Then Ken came down with complications and I was moved to the small bedroom upstairs.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That was the time that "Old Jess", our faithful old horse, was put down.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Ken did all the usual farm work including collecting sap from which Mum made maple syrup.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I recall going with Ken with a horse and sled, with cream cans and the barrel from the churn, to collect sap before we went to school in the morning.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Ken has stories to tell about Venetia catching him when he tumbled out of the car on a turn in the Bathurst Road, getting pecked near an eye by a hen, and Wallace MacDonald's visit to the Little Branch School. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>While in the service, Ken worked as a carpenter in the evening and on Saturdays wherever he was posted; he built his own home in Napan, Venetia's home after her fire and a home for his in-laws after their fire.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He pitched in to help others building homes, barns, sheds, etc.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Ken has a great memory and likes to recount jokes and stories of yesteryear.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I often check with him on items about family tree information.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He attends in local political meetings.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>At age 80 he purchased a computer and has learned the intricacies of email, games, and the internet and later he registered on Facebook.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Ken and Verne are regular participants in the seniors' card games at the Black River Hall and impromptu games either at their home or the home of friends.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When in the service, he was an active curler.</p>

<p><span>Notes for N</span>ORMAN<span> P</span>ETERS<span> G</span>LENDENNING<span>:</span></p>
<p>Norm was born on New Year's Eve, 1925, however, when the birth was registered; it was given as December 31, 1926.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Grandmother Glendenning was a Peters hence his second name. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>According to Lillian, Mum and Dad had difficulty deciding between the names Norman and Robert.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Norman attended the Little Branch School, classes in the Anglican Church in Bay du Vin and the Miramichi Rural High School.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Before school bus service was established, Norm used to take a horse to Bay du Vin, and later Bayside, picking up other students along the way.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The horse was stabled for the day in either Goymer Williston's or Harrison Smith's barn. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>At age 18, he enlisted in the army and found himself in the RCEME being sent first to Camp Utopia outside Saint John, New Brunswick and later to Woodstock, Ontario and Longueil, Quebec.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Norm was a good skater and a good dancer, and usually took me along when I first started going to dances in 1946. I also remember working with Norm at the hay; in the woods on cold and snowy Saturdays; butchering and peddling meat; shearing and dipping sheep and whatever else needed to be done. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Among Norm's stories is one about Wallace MacDonald throwing a peavey at him and Edwin Adams, trips on icy roads up river with Mr. Harper to tend to a sick horse and the first time he drove a vehicle with airbrakes.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Norman married Jean Watling from Point Aux Carr.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Alton and Eric now operate the farm although Norm continues to "supervise" and run errands; most every day he makes a trip to Miramichi City.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Branchview, the Glendenning farm, is the largest farm east of Miramichi and one of the largest in the Miramichi area.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Branchview has been the recipient of a number of awards. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Norman and Jean always welcome family to the old family home providing a place at the table for children, siblings, grandchildren, nephews and nieces alike.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He always tells visiting children where the kittens were and offers to give them one to take home.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Many young people of the community earned some money and learned important work habits while working on the farm with Norman and the "boys". <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Norm's early years were filled with long evenings of farm chores on top of full days driving truck for Alfred MacDonald or with John pressing hay.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>For a number of years Norman served as a trustee of the Black River Community Hall including during a major renovation in the 1960's and reconstruction in the 1970''s; was a director of Agricultural Society #103 and was a Director of the Northumberland Cooperative Dairy.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He participates in local political meetings.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Although not one to travel, in "retirement" he takes time to visit neighbours and friends around Black River.</p>

<p>Don was born at Little Branch on September 8, 1929 and was baptized in the new St. Paul's Presbyterian Church in Black River on opening day, July 20, 1930.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Like the rest of the family, he attended the Little Branch School; he also graduated from the Miramichi Rural High School.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>He completed a six-month teacher training program at Teachers' College in Fredericton in June 1947 and his first teaching position was at Middle Kouchibouguac.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Over the next few years he mixed teaching and study completing a PhD at Indiana University in 1964.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He also taught at the Miramichi Rural High School and the New Brunswick Institute of Technology. In 1969, after a number of years with the Federal Government, he moved to Prince Edward Island to become the first President of Holland College.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He also was active in a number of national professional organizations. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>After retiring from Holland College in 1987, he set up his own company and engaged in educational consulting in Canada and abroad.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>His overseas contracts provided many travel opportunities especially to Asia and Africa.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>He was bitten early by the travel bug and, either for business or pleasure, visited most every corner of Canada, most US states, and 40 countries in all. As a family, they lived in Moncton, Bloomington (Indiana), Ottawa, Vancouver and now in Charlottetown.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Don and Carol continue to travel and usually spend some time each winter in the southern USA.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>After retirement, Don resumed his interest in genealogy and visited Callister Hall, Scotland, where his great grandfather was born in 1807.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He publishes a Family Chronicle, an informal and occasional newsletter, which, thanks to Brian, is posted on the family website.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The Newsletter carries both family and personal recollections of growing up in Black River.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Retirement activities include genealogy, reading, volunteer work, travel, gardening, writing, letters to the editor - and working on his "farm".<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Don was awarded the Order of Canada in 1986.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Childhood memories include picking wild blueberries, mayflowers, cherries, plums, strawberries, cranberries and mushrooms; hours spent with George Watling playing in and along the brook; our water diversion projects during spring run-off; the family going to church by horse and wagon; Sunday school under the huge tree in Uncle Jim's back yard; dances in the Black River hall, at Mel Adams hall and elsewhere; Saturday nights cruising the streets in Chatham, and many more.</p>

<p>Notes for C<span>AROL</span> L<span>OUISE</span> C<span>HESNEY</span>:</p>
<p>Don married Carol Chesney from Peoria, Illinois.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Of the family, Carol, Brian, Janet and the grandchildren are all dual-citizens of Canada and the USA.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Carol is a graduate of Peoria High School, trained as a nurse at Methodist Hospital in Peoria and nursed in Stamford Connecticut and Moncton, NB.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Carol traveled from Stamford to Moncton in the middle of winter, wondering, as the train carried her through the woods of Maine and New Brunswick, where in the world she was going.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Carol likes to travel; their most exotic trip was a safari in Tanzania, Africa; they also spent two weeks as guests of the Peoples' Republic of China where Don delivered a lecture to Chinese College Directors.</p>

<p><br></p>
<p>"A funeral Mass will be said today for Lawrence Albert Smith, 55, a gregarious and hard=working concessioner known to his customers as "The Great one."<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He died on June 24 in his Somerville home of heart failure.</p>
<p>According to his wife, Sue (Rattie) smith, Mr. smith began selling popcorn and soda pop in the stands in Boston at age 16, after he was caught by security guards sneaking into a hockey game.</p>
<p>"What are you doing here." the security guard asked.</p>
<p>"Looking for the employment office," said Mr. Smith who was always quick with a comeback.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Personnel agents subsequently hired him as a vendor.</p>
<p>He later warned<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>friends "Don't ever sneak into a hockey game because they'll give you a job and you'll be there for life."</p>
<p>After working as a vendor in the stands, he sold souvenirs and other novelties at a concession stand for 38 years at Boston Garden.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When it closed, he sold programs at the Fleet Centre.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He is the only concessionaire ever named to the Boston Garden Hall of Fame.</p>
<p>A big, muscular man who was about six-feet tall and weighed more than 300 pounds, "The Great One" had an expansive personality.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He was always ready to pitch in with whatever needed to be done, his wife said, and he liked telling jokes.</p>
<p>"His customers would bring him jokes, and he liked to have new ones to tell him every night." she said.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"he was really good with people."</p>
<p>In addition to his wife, he leaves a son, Mark, of Springfield; three daughters, Julie, Melissa and Stacy, all of Somerville; his sister, Barbara Coppla, of Malden; and a<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>granddaughter.</p>
<p>The funeral Mass will be said at 10:00 am at St. Ann's Church in Somerville.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Burial will be in Holy Cross Cemetery in Malden."</p>
