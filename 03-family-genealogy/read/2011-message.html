<p><i>From our home to your home!</i></p>

<p>Greetings:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>As I write, I am looking into our back yard and thinking “What a beautiful morning”. The sun is shining, temperature about five degrees and hardly a cloud in the sky.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Shortly, I will head to the country for a walk in the woods.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The year was a good one and included a Christmas cruise at the end of 2010, a hip replacement in April for Carol, visits from Brian, Janet, granddaughter Laura and Cory, attendance at the annual Glendenning Family Reunion (our 34<sup>th</sup>), and a visit in October with Brian and Marie in New Mexico with the added joy of having Granddaughter, Lisa, come home while we were there.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>While in the west, we also travelled to Sonoma, California to visit the wine country.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>There are no significant changes in our lives since I last wrote except that Janet and Mike are now married and living in Ottawa and Laura is living and paying taxes in Maryland. Lisa continues her studies in Seattle where Kevin handles our Amazon accounts, Brian continues to improve our knowledge of the universe and Marie keeps the NRAO computers running, Janet keeps an eye on how our taxes are spent while Mike learns how to shovel Canadian snow.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I still plant a garden, go to my woodlot, and do a bit of volunteer work, my Holland College Recollections are finished and I have no intention of publishing them but they can be found on the Glendenning website.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Carol had a full recovery from her hip operation, is back in her bridge routine, enjoys her IPod (thanks to Brian and Marie) and generally keeps on the go.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Her flower garden this year was one of the best ever, while my vegetable was one of the poorest.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Our only confirmed travel plans at the moment is for three weeks on Treasure Island in Florida in early March.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The photo at the left showing the Little Branch School, with a snowplow heading towards Escuminac, was taken from the Glendenning front yard.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>May the blessings of the season be with you in the New Year.</p>
