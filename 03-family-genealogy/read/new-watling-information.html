  New Watling Information
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Don&#x27;s genealogical research on the Watling family, comparing census data with family records. Discusses Jubal Watling (husband of Susan Leach) from the 1841 PEI census and variations in available information, particularly noting the difference between two different Jubals and determining that Susan may have died and Jubal remarried to Louisa. The analysis compares Jubal&#x27;s age, occupation (mason), and landholdings to piece together family history. Written by Don as genealogical research notes.</div>

<p><span></span><b>New Watling Information</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Janet Watling shows Jubal and Susan with two additional children – John and Susannah.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><span>Any further information? Dates?</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Prince Edward Island Archives show a Jubal Watling living in Lot No. 52 at the time of the 1841 census.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Lot 52 is at the Eastern end of PEI near but not including Montague and Cardigan.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>According to the 1841 census, Jubal Watling was between 45 and 60 years of age, head of the family, his trade or occupation was that of a mason, he had 100 acres of land but one cannot tell if he rented or owned the land.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The household consisted of Jubal as head, one female between the ages of 45 and 60 presumably his wife, and 4 males under the age of 16.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Four members of the household were born in England and two were natives of the Island.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Other information in the PEI archives shows Jubal Watling married Louisa on 14 July 1831 and that they came from Norfolk County, England.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>An examination of the two sets of data shows that:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>One Jubal came from Norfolk and the other came from Suffolk.</p>
<p>The PEI Jubal has a different spouse; Susan Leach may have died and Jubal remarried.</p>
<p>The age brackets fit Jubal and Susan.</p>
<p>While my notes show only Jubal and Emily actually born in England, it is likely that the older children would have been born there also.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></p>
<p>Why would the girls not have been</p>
