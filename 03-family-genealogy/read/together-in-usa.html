  Together in USA
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Comprehensive historical narrative of Glendenning and Watling families&#x27; migration to USA and establishment in Tennessee during 1910-1913. Opens with post-WW2 context of Maritimer emigration patterns (woods work in Maine/New Hampshire initially, then year-round settlement). Describes Portland&#x27;s historical significance as Atlantic &amp; St. Lawrence Railroad terminus (&quot;Canada&#x27;s winter port&quot;), industrial development (locomotives, docks, construction jobs), 1866 fire (1500 buildings destroyed, 12,000 homeless), Promenade grand homes. Chronicles Glendenning family&#x27;s Portland settlement with siblings&#x27; roles and occupations. Extensively documents Elmer and Frank&#x27;s cartage business (Glendenning Bros. &amp; Co., 24 Hammond Street, ice delivery, general team work). Details Elmer&#x27;s work progression in woods (Maine/New Hampshire near Skowhegan, Millinocket, Berlin; lumbering with horses; record lumber cut). Parallels with Jane Watling&#x27;s Portland arrival (January 24, 1908, City Hall fire day), employment as nanny/housekeeper with Jennison family. Covers marriage ceremony (October 18, 1910 at Little Branch home of parents by Rev. George Grant), honeymoon in Montreal, residence in Bonny Eagle, Maine. Describes Jane&#x27;s household journal/purchase record (January 1911 entries documenting domestic economy). Extensive section on Parksville, Tennessee: geographic/historic context (Polk County, Ocoee River, southeast of Chattanooga); technical details on dam construction (Ocoee No. 1 and No. 2 developments, Tennessee Power Authority documents); construction timeline (August 1910 commencement, February 1911 concrete placement, January 27, 1912 plant start); employment scale (1500+ workers); infrastructure (constructed town with waterworks, stores, hospital, police); concrete placement rates (12-15 hundred cubic yards daily). Details relocation from Ocoee No. 1 to Ocoee No. 2 (Caney Creek, May-October 1912). Contains repeated sections (FILE 8 duplicates FILE 5 and FILE 6 content). TRUNCATED in extraction (original ~6345 words).</div>

years, Maritimers flocked to the USA to find work; this trend did not
really change until after WW2 when Maritimers travelled west, first
to work in the plants in Ontario but later to work in the oilfields
of Alberta.  The Glendenning and Watling families were no exception. 
I am told three times a day, trains left Prince Edward Island and
made connections with trains to the </span><span lang="en-GB">A</span><span lang="en-GB">Boston

Maritimers found their first jobs in the woods of Maine and New
Hampshire, initially in winter only.  Many returned home to fish or
farm in the summer; later many found year-round work and eventually
became permanent residents.  Young women, including my Mother and,
later, my two sisters went to Portland or Boston and found work with
families looking for a nanny, a cook, a housekeeper or a </span><span lang="en-GB">A</span><span lang="en-GB">jill

In
the late 1800's, Portland was the terminus of the Atlantic and St.
Lawrence Railroad (Grand Trunk), a line to Montreal which &quot;made
Portland into Canada's winter port&quot;.  Other heavy industry was
to be found in that area of Portland including the building of
locomotives and the construction of docks to accommodate
transatlantic passenger vessels.  Street names St. Lawrence, Quebec
and Montreal for example further reflect the Canadian connection.</p>

Some
1500 buildings were destroyed and 12 000 people left homeless in the
great fire of 1866.  New and presumably better housing was
constructed and it appears that lighter industry began to locate in
that area.  Around the turn of the century a few grand homes began to
appear on the Promenade which provided a sweeping view of the water. 
Construction provided many jobs and it is likely that Dad worked in
the construction trade field.  In fact, Walter recalled a trip to
Portland with Dad and a visit to a construction site to see some
friends.</p>

In
the context of all the industrial activity and development, it is not
surprising that Portland  attracted Maritimers, including the

Glendennings
seemed to have been well established in Portland at the turn of the
century with Venetia, the oldest child likely having played the role
of &quot;host&quot; as each new family member moved south.  Venetia's
address was Falmouth Foreside which is just north of Portland and
between Portland and Freeport.  Falmouth Foreside still exists
although it may be considered part of the Portland metropolitan area.</p>

	We

	Portland, at least for a while, included Venetia (Mrs R. L. Doring),

	Dad,
	and presumably his brothers, also lumbered in New Hampshire prior to
	1910.  Because they took their horses, they must have yarded and
	hauled logs. I believe that they also cut lumber.  John recalled Dad
	telling about a &quot;record&quot; of lumber cut (marked on a camp
	wall) that stood for many years.  Ken thinks that Uncle George

	George,
	and James A. Watling worked in the woods with Dad.  Ramsay MacLean,
	of Upper Black River, worked with Dad in New Hampshire.  I recall
	John saying that he thought that Ramsay had been yarding with a
	horse or a team and, and did not install a bridle to slow down the
	sled on a steep hill, and the logs got away from him and dragged a
	horse down the hillside killing it. From my reading of lumbering on
	the hills in New Hampshire, this would not have been an unusual
	event.  According to Herbert Daley, Herb Daley, Dad’s first
	cousin, also worked with Dad in New Hampshire and, perhaps, in
	Portland.</p>

	Prior
	to 1910, Elmer and his brother, Frank, operated a business in
	Portland under the name Glendenning Bros. &amp; Co. (All Kinds of
	Team Work). Robert Glendenning told me that Uncle Guy also worked in
	the cartage business; whether he was a partner is not known. They
	operated from 24 Hammond Street, Portland, Maine.  Walter, and
	others, remember Dad telling about delivering ice to homes on a
	regular basis.  Delivering meant that they opened the door and put
	the ice in the icebox inside the house.  Although I always thought
	it was only Dad and Uncle Frank in the trucking business, other
	brothers may have also been involved.</p>

	she kept someone's children. (Doring's, MacLean's, or ?).  Jane was
	always active in church work and it is possible that they met at a

	Maritimers working in the USA at that time and it is not unlikely
	that there was a network Maritimers in the Portland area.

	Portland to Loggieville, then by horse and wagon to Little Branch. 
	Apparently, at that time, there was a corduroy road from the Napan
	Road down through the woods, which joined the Point Aux Carr Road
	near Palmers.  From there he would have crossed the Victoria Bridge
	to Hexham and from there to the Watling home at Little Branch (where
	Neil now lives).  Lillian said they honeymooned in Montreal.  They

	A

	at Caney Creek.  Construction commenced in May 1912 and was
	completed in October 1912. Many people who had worked on the
	Parksville dam were called back a few months later to work on the
	second dam and flume line. From entries in the autograph album, we
	know that Mum and Dad were among this group.  We do not know if
	there was a break in Dad's employment and, if there was, if they
	stayed in Parksville or went somewhere else until work resumed.  The
	reason for thinking this is that entries in her journal end on
	November 8, 1911 and commence again on April, 1912.  There are no
	entries for May, 1912, however, entries resume on June 1 under the

	flume line is fed from a small diversion dam and only drops 17.5
	feet in the 5 miles. The flume was made of &quot;long leafed pine&quot;
	timber, like railway ties, and was cut locally. It is actually a box
	about 10 feet high, 15 feet wide ad 5 miles long. Apparently a small
	&quot;dinky&quot; railroad ran on top of the flumeline as the flume

	The

	work at Parksville and the power station is operated remotely from
	another site.  Most of the houses have been torn down or moved.
	Presumably they were all company houses. Today, only three or four
	of the original buildings still stand. They are located on a gentle
	slope back from the river below the dam. Remaining buildings are
