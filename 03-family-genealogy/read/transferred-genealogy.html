<p>Subject: William Glendinning</p>
<p>Date: October 24, 2005 11:47 AM</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Hi Don,</p>
<p>A bit more about William Glendinning son of John Glendinning and Mary Rae.</p>
<p>The entry in your father's family bible ties in very nicely with other information I have, to confirm it is the same person.</p>
<p>In 1855 a daughter Jane Glendinning was born on 9 Sep 1855 to William Glendinning and Grace Marshall.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The place of birth was given as Little Skellyholm, St Mungo Parish, Dumfriesshire.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The birth record noted that this couple had one previous child, a son who was still living.</p>
<p>In the 1851 census for St Mungo is the family of William Glendinning aged 32 a farm labourer born Middlebie, his wife Grace aged 36 born Hoddam, and a son John aged 11 a farm labourer born St Mungo.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>So that would make John born about 1839 or 40.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In fact the OPR has a baptism for this John on 23 Feb 1841 at Middlebie.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The two facts could be consistent as he might have been born in St Mungo the previous year and baptised when he was a few months old, back in his father's old church.</p>
<p>The bible entry for William pointed me towards the Statutory Index of deaths and this confirms William died in St Mungo in 1874 aged 56.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I do not have the full record of this.</p>
<p>But I do have the full record of his daughter Jane as she died in Langholm and this town is of particular relevance for my family so I have most of the Glendinning records for that town.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You can see her record at http://www.glendinning.name/ancestry/records/dcert839.htm#1876_41<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You will see she was unmarried and both her parents were deceased.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Her father William was listed as a Grocer.</p>
<p>I think that is all I have of this family.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Hope it is of interest.</p>
<p>Ian</p>

<p>Hi Don!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As far as I know, nobody has been researching these Glendenning's except for a distant cousin and myself.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Most of my early information came from her. We've made inquiries to various people and have come up with really nothing. I spoke to the Glendenning branch here and they don't know too much beyond their grandparents...which of course we had pretty much pieced together from census reports, marriage records, and PANB files.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I'm attaching a word document of the Glendenning information that I have for the first 3 generations.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I'm a descendant of Jane Glendenning through my Carey and Black family.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My gg-grandmother on the Carey side and my gg-grandfather on the Black side were brother and sister.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If you see that any of these names match up with Ian Glendinning's information, please feel free to give him my e-mail address.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Take care during the hurricane!!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I know we're supposed to get some wind &amp; rain, but nothing really major - as far as we can tell, it'll be pretty much the same as what Hurricane Juan sent us a couple of years ago ;)</p>

<p>Dear Don,</p>
<p>Your web site and all the newsletters are remarkable! I will look at some more of them. I'm working on a story about the Crocker family that Bertha married into, and when I get it ready I'll e-mail you something for the newsletter.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I'm e-mailing you her marriage certificate in a separate e-mail.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Re Joan Crocker and her brother:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Joan M. Crocker, b. 16 Jan. 1931, d. 2 Jan. 1994. Last residence, Windham (which is near Sebago)</p>
<p>I will look for an obit later in the week.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Franklin C. Crocker, b. 16 Jan. 1932, d. 29 Nov. 1996. Last residence, Stone Mountain, GA. Social Security number issued in Maine.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I looked in 2 places and found death records that appear to be Joan and Franklin:</p>
<p>the Social Security Death Index:</p>
<p>http:ssdi.genealogy.rootsweb.com/cgi-bin/ssdi.cgi</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Use the entry squares at the bottom of the page, not the first ones that appear. Don't subscribe or pay for these SSI records, they are free. (If you send to the government for a record, it costs.)</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The other site I use all the time is Maine Archives Marriage Records and Maine Archives Death Records. You can send for marriage certificates and they will have more information, such as parents' names, birthplaces, etc.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I subscribe to the census on Genealogy.com and I get Heritage Quest as a member of Maine Historical Society.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Thanks for telling me about your wonderful web site!</p>

<p><br></p>
<p><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Did you ever get an answer on your "What's in a name" query of 6/13/04? The reason I ask is that I have been working on a genealogy project re/the Crocker family, and I had your query that I clipped last year, along with a marriage license I sent for for Lillian and John's daughter, Bertha, who married Harry Clayton Crocker in 1929. The papers sat in a file all this time, until I found some Crocker graves in Evergreen Cemetery and researched the story on Capt. Charles Crocker's memorial (he died in the harbor of St. Pierre, Martinique, at the volcanic distruction of Mount Pelee.)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>(That was how I connected Harry Crocker to the Charles Crocker family.He was a nephew of Capt. Charles.)</p>
<p><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Anyway, I think the death date of Lillian M. Glendenning was May 23, 1967, at the age of 92. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>(She was born in Sep. 1875.)<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>If this is not old news to you, I'd be happy to look up her obit at the Portland Public Library, as I work in the bank next door to it.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p>It is Ada Northrup who married Gilbert Glendenning.</p>

<p>hello all from Halifax<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Nov 19, 2005</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I am being lazy this Saturday evening and while there is work to do I don’t<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>feel like it. So I’ll write instead.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>It was a sunny day here in the east today but it started off quite cool. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The fountain in the pond froze and I had to take the nozzle off and melt the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>ice – so winter is coming.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Christy and I did not do anything really exciting all day.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She worked on<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>school stuff and I went shopping to collect things I needed for chores.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p>Hi Don ;</p>
<p>Many thanks for the above ,very interesting .1934 was certainly a very a big year ,(my birth year) ha,ha.</p>
<p>I expect the salary listed was very respectable for that period.My starting salary in RBC in 1951 was only $1250.and this was not before inflation,not easy days.</p>
<p>We leave on Wednesday for Calgary and will return December 30/ 05<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>We will leave for Florida January 17/06 as we have to take our property in Venice one week early thus we leave the last week of February.</p>
<p>We may not be able to get together<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>in Florida unless you folks come to Venice,come if you can.</p>
<p>We expect to go to Sackville in May (Enids anniversary year 50 th at MT) so we may be able to arrange to meet then.</p>
<p>Enid and I had a visit with Vera and Lorne Caughill at the<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Probus Christmas luncheon,they are well and asked to be remembered to you.Now best wishes for a great season ,enjoyed # 107. Art</p>

<p>I have not connected John Glendinning and Mary Rae any further back, so don't know where he may fit in with other families I have on record.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As far as I can see there are no gravestones for Glendinning in Middlebie and no Mary Rae on any other Glendinning gravestones in Dumfriesshire.</p>
<p>There were two main areas in Canada that my Glendinning line went to.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>One was Ontario (mainly Scarborough and Streetsville initially) and the other to Richibucto in New Brunswick, so I have been trying to follow them up.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If you would like to send me some details of your line from John Glendinning and Margaret Harley it would be useful, if only so I don't trace them thinking they are "mine".</p>

<p>Message: I am interested in a map of the Black River and its tributaries.</p>
<p>The Black River flows into Bay du Vin near the mouth. I am into genealogy</p>
<p>and community history would like an electronic map on which I can show a</p>
<p>variety of customized features such as original land grants, location of</p>
<p>schools and churches, households in 1939, etc. Thanks in advance for your</p>
<p>help Don Glendenning</p>
