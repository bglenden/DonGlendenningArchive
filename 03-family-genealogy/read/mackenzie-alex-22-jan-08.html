<p>FUNERAL WEDNESDAY</p>
<p>Mr Angus McKenzie, a highly respected business man passed away at his home here Monday morning<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>after an illness of about six months of cancer, aged 59 years.</p>
<p>The deceased gentleman was born in Tabusintac, Northumberland county, where he was educated. He<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>moved to Campbellton about fifteen years ago and entered into business, which he has sussessfully<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>conducted up to the time of his death. A widow and a niece, Miss Godfrey, survive.</p>
<p>Mr McKenzie was an active member of St Andrew's church, and took a deep interest in church matters.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Especially was he interested in missionary work, contributing liberally to this movement. In the church his<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>presence will be missed.</p>
<p>He was for two years the Poor Commissioner for the town and as such was ever a kind protector of the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>needy. Of a kind and generous nature none who were truly in need ever sought aid in vain.</p>
<p>About six months ago, he suffered from a growth on his throat which on examination proved to be cancer.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>He went to Montreal but nothing could be done for him and he awaited the end with Christian fortitude and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>patience. Ever cheerful and bright, he was during his illness an example of a truly Christian man.</p>
<p>The funeral will take place from his late home, Water Street, tomorrow (Wednesday) afternoon at 2 o'clock.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Internment will be in the rural cemetery. The bereaved have the sympathy of all.</p>

<p><br></p>
<p>Mr Roderick McKenzie, a notice of whose death appeared recently in the ADVANCE was a native of Sutherlandshire Scotland.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>He came to America over 50 years ago, residing for some years at Pictou and then at Tabusintac. He came to Black River about<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>40 years ago. He died in his 85th year, although his death was incorrectly stated at 95 in both the ADVANCE and Telegraph.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The subject of this brief sketch was a good specimen of a man, in his phsyique, tall, straight, and wellformed, and of an<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>agreeable presence. He had excellent mental and moral qualities; honesty and integrity characterized his actions. He possessed<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>the tenderness of heart, the manly determination and the energetic perseverance of a true highlander. Many acres of the "</p>
<p>Hardwoods" of Black River were cleared by his axe, and there is now a fine farm - the result of his industry - in the midst of the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>forest. The deceased was an elder of the Presbyterian church of Black River, and took a deep interest in the cause of Christian<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>truth, and the advancement of vital religion. He lived respected, and beloved and died regretted by all who knew him, and his<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>memory will be held in regard for many a day. He was a humble follower of his Saviour and his end was peace. It is to such men<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>as Roderick MacKenzie that New Brunswick owes much of its prosperity.</p>

<p>TABUSINTAC, June 13. - One Sabbath evening, 5th June, Tabusintac was startled by the intimation of the sudden death of Mrs.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>William Simpson. Mrs. Simpson, who was seemingly in the best of health, went with the servant to the barn to attend to the usual<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>duties there when she suddenly and without any previous warning dropped dead. Her husband and son who were immmediately<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>called by the servant to render assitance, thinking that life could not be extinct, made every possible effort for her restoration, but<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>a few minutes revealed the sad truth that the spirit had fled. Dr. Doiron of Tracadie, who had been sent for, on his arrival<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>pronounced death to have resulted from hemmorrhage of the brain. The deceased was a sister of Mrs. Edmunds of Chatham,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p>and remained at Tabusantic, but after ten years the brothers gave up the sea and entered 'the Hardwoods' of Little Branch to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>farm. Conditions there were crude and primitive. The dwellings consisted of mere huts into which the homemakers were glad<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>enough to poke themselves. The old fashioned wooden plow, her father carried on his back for nearly two miles. Split shingles<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>provided a source of scanty revenue. These were carried the same distance, loaded in canoes, poled to Chatham and sold for<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
