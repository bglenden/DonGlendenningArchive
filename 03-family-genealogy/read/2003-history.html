<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal">The
author grew up in the community of Black River and in St. Paul’s
Presbyterian Church.  St. Paul’s was an integral part of our family
life; my mother and father were among the founders.  This paper is an
informal and brief record of St. Paul’s Church, in the context of
more than two centuries of Presbyterianism along the south shore of
the Miramichi River in New Brunswick, Canada.  It is included as part
of a binder of photos, clippings and other mementoes prepared to mark
the 75<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the opening of the church.</p>

the information was gathered during brief visits to the Miramichi;
longer visits would have provided greater access to church records,

RIVER </b>
</p>
<p align="center" style="font-style: normal"><br />

</p>
<p style="font-style: normal"><br />

</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal">The
name, Black River, is thought to have come from the MicMac word
Matquantigook that probably meant “black river” and is a river
with some tributaries flowing into Bay du Vin and the inner Miramichi
Bay.  At one time, Black River appears to have extended as far east
as Bayside (Miramichi) and perhaps as far as Bay du Vin.  Black River
was settled during the late 1700s and early 1800s with most of the
land along the Little Black River (Little Branch) being granted on
June 3, 1812.  
</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal"><br />

</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal">The
earliest settlers in the Black River as we know it today were United
Empire Loyalists and Highland Scots some of whom settled initially
along the Saint John River and later relocated to the Miramichi. 
Settlers in Bay du Vin tended to be English and followers of the
Church of England with Black River being Scottish and Presbyterian. 
The land was heavily wooded, winters were long and cold and life was
hard.  But pioneers were hardy folk who were determined to carve out
a new life for themselves, their families and their offspring.  These
settlers brought crude axes, shovels and other implements to clear
land, plant crops and build homes.  And they also brought their
religion – mostly Presbyterian.</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal"><br />

</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal">Earliest
names occurring on grants made from crown lands along the Black River
included MacNaughton, MacDonald, MacLean, MacRae, Gunn, Sinclair,
Fowlie, McGraw, Cameron, Kelley, MacDougall and MacBeath.  Many
descendants with these names can still be found in the community two
hundred years later. 
</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal"><br />

</p>
<h1>THE FIRST CHURCH</h1>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal"><br />

</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal"><br />

</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal">At
first the settlement was served by itinerant ministers and
missionaries.  Among the visiting ministers was the Rev. Dr. James
Drummond MacGregor, a Scot who had been sent out to minister to the
Presbyterians in Pictou, Nova Scotia.  In addition to serving the
folk of Pictou, MacGregor traveled throughout New Brunswick, Nova
Scotia and Prince Edward Island.  Each visit to a community usually
lasted several days, and even weeks, and included preaching, praying,
and religious conversations.   The <u>Memoir of Rev. James MacGregor,
D.D.</u> recount his visit to Black River (p.316) as follows:</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal"><br />

</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 0.5in; font-style: normal">
“<i>On the first and second visits to the Miramichi in 1797 and
1807, he preached and baptized at Black River, Bay du Vin, and on
both sides of the Miramichi, up as far as the point, so called, at
the junction of the North and South-west branches.  Those who
recollect him remark his happy faculty in introducing religious
conversation.”</i></p>
<p align="justify"><br />

</p>
<p align="justify"><br />

</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal"><br />

</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal">And
further on:</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal"><br />

</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 0.5in">“His
being present at the induction of Mr. Thompson in 1817 is well
remembered.”</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal"><br />

</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal">A. W.
MacDougall reports that a Rev. Jones resided in Bay du Vin but his
religious affiliation is not known.</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal"><br />

</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal">In
1812, a church, thought to be Presbyterian, was built in at Tuckers
Point, at the mouth of the Bay du Vin River on the west side.  (While
Tucker’s Point was used in conversation by several people, the name
does not appear in <u>Geographical Names of New Brunswick</u> by
Rayburn, 1975.)  Some gravestones are still to be found in the area. 
The church served all Protestants in the area.  A. W. MacDougall
reported that a contract for the building of the church was in the
possession of a “gentleman in Bay du Vin” and that the document: 
</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal"><br />

</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 0.5in">“ bore the signature
of the contractor, a Mr. Gray of Chatham, and also the names of three
men representing the people, John B. Williston, Farquhar MacRae and a
Mr. McLeod.  Mr. Williston lived in Bay du Vin, Mr. McRae in Bay
Side, and Mr. McLeod in Black River.</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 0.5in"><br />

</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 0.5in"><i>The
church was a small building of frame construction, and was built
close to the shore on the westerly side of the south of Bay du Vin
River, at a spot since known as ‘Ullock’s Point’, from the name
of the man who owned the surrounding land, and where a ferry
connected with the other side of the river.  It was used for public
worship as occasion required until the building of the first church
on the site at Black River, and then fell into disuse…</i></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 0.5in"><br />

</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 0.5in"><i>A
small plot of land adjoining the church was used as a cemetery, and a
considerable number of people were interred there.</i></p>
<p align="justify"><br />

</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal"><br />

</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal"><br />

</p>
<h1>ST STEPHENS PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH</h1>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal"><br />

</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal"><br />

</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal">Given
that Black River was a growing community and that most of the
Presbyterians lived several miles from Tucker’s Point, a community
of people who worshipped mostly in the English tradition, it is not
surprising that talk soon turned, first to finding a Presbyterian
minister and later to constructing a place of worship.  A. W.
MacDougall reports that a public meeting was held in Bay du Vin in
1818 with a view to securing a resident minister to serve Bay du Vin,
Tabusintac and Burnt Church - a minister who could speak in Gaelic as
well as English since “there are several amongst us who do not
understand the English”.  
</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal"><br />

</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal"><br />

</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal"><img src="img/2003-history/img002.png" align="bottom" />
</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal"><br />

</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal"><br />

</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal"><br />

</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal">In
1834, a public meeting was held in Black River at which it was
decided to petition for a minister to serve both Black River and
Tabusintac.  In response to the request, the Rev. Simon Fraser was
dispatched to serve their needs.  I do not know if the Rev. Fraser
initially served both Black River and Bay du Vin but it appears that
shortly thereafter he became the minister for Black River only.  
</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal"><br />

</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal">On
November 10, 1834 a meeting was held in Black River at the residence
of Mr. Archibald Cameron and a committee was struck to proceed with
the erection of a church on Alexander Gunn’s Point, a location
already in use as a burial ground.  Committee members were:</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal"><br />

</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 0.5in; font-style: normal">

<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal"><br />

</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal">W.
MacDougall describes Gunn’s Point (part of Lot #4 granted to
Alexander Gunn on June 3, 1812) as follows:</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal"><br />

</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 0.5in">“The
proposed site for the church, which has long been known as Church
Point, is a peninsula several acres in extent, jutting out from the
mainland on the South Side of the Black River about three miles from
its mouth, and connected to the shore by a narrow neck of land.  It
has dry sandy soil, and at that time was partly covered with a heavy
growth of timber.  It is an ideal location for a church, probably
without parallel in the whole Province.  A portion of it had
previously been used as a burial ground, and there it was decided to
build the church.”</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal"><br />

</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal"><br />

</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal"><br />

</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal"><br />

</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal">On
April 21, 1835 a contract was awarded to William Porteous to erect
the church; structural timber was cut locally.  The building was 45
feet long by 30 feet wide with an 18-foot wall.  On November 20,
1836, the first house of worship, St Stephen’s Presbyterian Church,
was formally opened with the Rev. Mr. Fraser as its first minister.</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal"><br />

</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal">In the
years that followed, St. Stephens Church was beset by two major
problems. The financial problems resulted from the costs of
construction and the also the cost of ongoing operations.  (This is
still a challenge to churches in the 21<sup>st</sup> century.)</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal"><br />

</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal"> By the
turn of the century, St. Stephen’s sanctuary had become quite
dilapidated and, instead of making repairs, a decision was taken to
build a new sanctuary.  The result was the opening of the present
sanctuary on December 30, 1906.</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal"><br />

</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal">Church
differences in Scotland were transported to Canada and resulted in
tensions within St. Stephens Presbyterian Church in Black River.  The

</p>
<h1>CHURCH UNION</h1>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal"><br />

</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal">The
Church Union Movement resulted in the creation of the United Church
of Canada in 1925.  It had been fifty years in the making and should
be viewed as part of an even greater movement first towards union
among Presbyterians, and later with other denominations as well.  
</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal"><br />

</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal">Over
the years there were many divisions within the Presbyterian Church in
Scotland.  Most of the differences resulted from differing views as
to the proper or acceptable relationship between church and state. 
Scots were not prepared to accept a state church, as was the case in
England.  Perhaps another cause for dissension was the strong view
that no minister or church hierarchy should stand between a person
and his/her God.   Then there was the issue of churches being able to
appoint their own minister rather than have a minister appointed by
the land owner or proprietor or some church body.  By 1843 there were
four different Presbyterian churches in Scotland – and Scots
brought their differing views with them when they came to Canada. 
The early mid -1800’s witnessed a movement towards unification
among a number of Presbyterian denominations and resulted, by 1875,
in the creation of the Presbyterian Church in Canada - and
discussions with other Presbyterians continued.</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal"><br />

</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal">Other
churches were coming together as well.  Union within the Methodist
congregation was achieved by 1884 and within the Congregationalist
churches by 1906.  The Church of England, as early as 1836, had
appointed a committee to explore possible union with like-minded
denominations.  Talk of further unification, therefore, was not
unexpected.  In fact, at the inception of the Presbyterian Church in
Canada, Dr. John Cook, the Moderator, said,  “far larger union is
in store”.  Others expressed similar sentiments.  A federation of
denominations was also considered an option.</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal"><br />

</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal">A
number of congregations cooperated in the Sunday School Association
of Canada, Temperance Movement, Evangelical Alliance, etc.; this
helped to break down other denominational barriers.  There was even a
sharing of social services between congregations, cooperation in the
training of clergy and a wider discussion of matters theological.  
</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal"><br />

</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal">By 1904
discussions were well under way towards an organic union among
Protestant denominations led by a joint committee representing the
Presbyterians, Methodist and Congregational denominations.   The
report to the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church concluded
that the process should not be unduly hurried, should carry the
consent of the entire membership and should not be contemplated until
all the courts of the church had a chance to consider it.  “Consent
of the entire membership” and concerns about an unclear doctrinal
statement for the new church appear to be the major points of
dissention over the next two decades.  In 1906 invitations to
participate in discussions were issued to the Church of England and
Baptist conventions but these invitations were declined.  By 1912,
those against union had begun to coalesce and organize.  While votes
at Presbytery, Synod and General Assembly levels continued to favour
union; numbers against union at the congregational level continued to
grow.  Support for union was strongest among clergy and leadership
moved to the courts of the church rather than remaining with members
and adherents.  
</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal"><br />

</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal">Decisions
on church union were taken by each congregation.  Tabulated
nationally, the 1925 voting results were:</p>
<p style="font-style: normal"><br />

</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; font-style: normal">Votes
cast in favour		121,547</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; font-style: normal">Votes

<p style="font-style: normal">	Total eligible
voters				<u>379,762	</u></p>
<p style="font-style: normal"><br />

</p>
<p style="font-style: normal">In the Maritime Synod,
18,883 voted in favour of union and 13,743 voted against.</p>
<p style="font-style: normal"><br />

</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal">Of the
4,981 members of the Miramichi Presbytery in 1925, 2,011 voted in
favour of union and 647 voted against union with 2.323 not voting. 
Figures for St. Stephens Church are not available, however, the
majority favoured union and St. Stephens Presbyterian Church became
St. Stephens United Church.</p>

<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal">The
writer is not unaware of the tension within the congregation at the
time, and within church families, with events surrounding Church
Union; some may still exist.  Perhaps the outstanding issue is that
of the cemetery.  Road signs point to both the Black River Cemetery
and St. Stephens Cemetery yet they are one and the same.

<h5 align="justify">BURIAL GROUND</h5>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal"><br />

</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal"><br />

</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal">As
mentioned earlier, there was a burial ground beside the church in Bay
du Vin.  As early as 1823, however, the first burial took place on
the present burial site in Black River.  The original land on which
the church and cemetery are located, Lot Number 4, was granted to
Alexander Gunn on June 3, 1812.  The area on which the church and
cemetery are located was known as Gunn’s Point.  Later ownership of
the land passed to Enoch Godfrey and, in 1823 his father-in-law,
Robert MacBeath, died and was buried on the Point.  The second
person, Duncan MacNaughton, was buried at Gunn’s point in 1824. 
Perhaps this was the origin of the “Black River Cemetery” to
distinguish it from the one in use in Bay du Vin.  In any case,
according to my information, St. Stephen’s Presbyterian Church
purchased the land in 1836 at the time that the new church was
erected in Black River.  The name, Church Point, which applies to the
location at present, probably arises from that time.</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal"><br />

</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal">A
search of church records may throw more light on the issue of
cemetery name.  Was it St. Stephens Cemetery?  Or St. Stephens
Presbyterian Cemetery?  Again in 1925, did the name remain as St.
Stephens Cemetery or was it formally changed to St. Stephens United
Church Cemetery.  I leave it to others to sort out this issue.  In
any case, in 1940, the congregation of St. Stephens United Church
passed a resolution granting Presbyterians the same rights and
privileges as to the use of the cemetery as they had before church
union and invited St. Paul’s congregation to name a member to the
Cemetery Committee.  The Presbyterians accepted the offer and decided
that a separate Presbyterian cemetery was not needed.</p>

</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal">Members
of St. Stephen’s Presbyterian Church deciding to continue in the
Presbyterian tradition formed a new congregation and for the first
five years services were held in the Little Branch School, the Upper
Black River School and in members’ homes led by visiting ministers
and local congregational leaders.    Student ministers and laymen
also conducted services.  In 1926 the John Robertson Women’s
Missionary Society, a Women’s League, Mission Band and Sunday
School were formed and the first baptisms (Kenneth Glendenning,
Norman Glendenning and Roy Watling) were conducted on June 14 by Rev.
F. G. MacIntosh.  A Presbyterian Young People’s Society was formed
in 1930 with Venetia (Glendenning) Russell as the first President.</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal"><br />

<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal">What
appears to be the first meeting of the Session of the emerging St.
Paul’s Presbyterian Church was held in the Upper Black River School
on September 30, 1928 at 3:00 pm with Rev. Wm. Stewart as Moderator
and James A. Watling and James F. Godfrey as Elders.  James F.
Godfrey was elected Clerk of Session.  James A. Watling was elected
Representative Elder, a position he held for many years.  The meeting
opened with prayer and the Sacrament of the Lord’s Supper was
observed.

Friday, July 18, 1930, the 34<sup>th</sup> annual Miramichi
Presbyterial met in the new facility.  Activities included a morning
session, lunch served by the ladies of Black River, a missionary
pageant and service in the afternoon.  The evening included a pageant
presented by the Chatham PYPS, installation of officers, remarks by
Dr. Squires, Minister of the Presbyterian Church in Chatham and by
Mr. James A. Watling, the Representative Elder.  A formal service of
dedication was held at 8:00 pm chaired by Rev. J. W. Paul of
Bathurst, Moderator and Clerk of Presbytery.  Presbyterians in Black
River now had their own sanctuary again.</p>

<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal">A
clipping from the local paper, unnamed and undated, describes the new
building as follows:</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal"><br />

</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 0.5in">“The new church is
completed and ready for opening.  A fine and beautiful edifice it is
– a credit to any community.  In these days when any kind of a
building may pass for a church, it can be truly said that the
structure in Black River reflects the ideal eclesiastical
architecture for a small house of worship.  The church has evoked
nothing but praise from all who have seen it.  Great appreciation is
expressed to all who worked to make it what it is – to the building
committee, to the carpenters in charge and others who have laboured
without stint.”</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal"><br />

</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal">In late
1930, discussions were held with Presbyterian congregations in both
Kouchibouguac and Richibucto with a view to sharing the services of a
full-time minister.  As a result, Knox Presbyterian Church,
Kouchibouguac and St. Paul’s became a two-point charge.  In 1950,
Calvin Presbyterian Church began to share a minister with St. Paul's
and Knox – an arrangement that continues to this day.</p>
