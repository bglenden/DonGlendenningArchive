<p>Dear Nancy:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Thanks for your newsy note.</p>
<p>Great to hear from you</p>
<p>Thought of sending an Email but not sure that I have your correct address – (katybug1997@att.net - ?)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Let me know if this is correct, please let me know and we’ll keep in touch via Email.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Mine is more complicated – dglend@pei.sympatico.ca</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>We are doing ok; Carol was had pneumonia with complications last summer; almost did not make it. Is home now; can look after herself but tires easily and rests a lot.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She is on air, not oxygen, at night. Able to be out but needs a steadying hand. We were able to spend time at the cottage this summer. Have any great memories of your Mum and dad, in fact of the family and remember<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>your visits both to New Brunswick and Christmas in Ottawa. A lot of water over the dam or under the bridge since then</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Our offspring<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>are well; Janet lives in Ottawa; we talk with her every Sunday.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Brian lives in New Mexico.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Granddaughter Laura lives in Maryland; Granddaughter Lisa is married and lives in Seattle.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Our big news is our first Great granddaughter Astrid born, I think, on April 28.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In fact, Brian and Marie are visiting Lisa in Seattle these days.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Hard to believe that your Mum and Dad are gone and at a relatively young age.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Yes, I remember Howard;<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Carol<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>and I visited Howard once in that beautiful Senior’s home.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Carol and I had dinner with you and Dennis in Peoria; thought that you were living somewhere near Henry.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Your Dad was a man of faith, I remember how important his church was in his life and his daily practice.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Thanks for the book by CS Lewis; I look forward to spending time with him this winter.</p>
<p>Also glad to hear about your children and family.</p>
<p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>I have quite a bit of information about Carol’s side of the family.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If interested, I would be glad to share.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I did send a copy to the Henry Library a number of years ago.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Nancy, you’ll never know how much I appreciate your letter. Thank you</p>
<p>All the best to you and your family</p>
<p>Love</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Uncle Don</p>
