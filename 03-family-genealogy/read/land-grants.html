  Land Grants
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Detailed land grant registry for the Little Black River area compiled from New Brunswick Department of Natural Resources records. Lists original Crown grants with lot numbers, acreages, grantee names, and dates from 1812 onward. Documents Alexander McDonald Sr.&#x27;s 1812 grant of Lot #2 (225 acres, now owned by Norman Glendenning), Sinclair, Glendinning, and Glendenning family grants, and Jubal Watling Jr.&#x27;s 1881 grant of Lot #30 in the Meadows. Notes Elmer Glendenning&#x27;s 1936 grant of 100 acres. Includes detailed lot maps showing neighbors. Questions origin of &quot;Millers Bridge&quot; at Norman&#x27;s property. **NOT originally written by Don** — this is compiled from government records.</div>

<p><b>Land Grants</b><b></b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The Department of Natural Resources, Fredericton has maps showing the first owners of land granted by the Crown.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They also have a book listing all the original owners.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Information in the book and maps should be the same, but isn<span>=</span>t always.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The following information was gleaned from these sources.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Alexander McDonald Sr. (not MacDonald) was granted Lot #2, 225 acres, on 1812-06-03. This is the property now owned by Norman Glendenning.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>On the same date and further up the Branch</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Kenneth Sinclair was granted Lot #3 with 220 acres.</p>
<p>Angus Sinclair was granted Lots 4 &amp; 5 with 410 acres.</p>
<p>Alexander McDonald (the book says Sr. but the map shows Jr.) was granted Lot #6 consisting of 140 acres.</p>
<p>The next land was granted to George Fowlie but numbers and boundaries are not clear to me.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The west side of the Alexander McDonald property forms the rear line of the following properties:</p>
<p>Lot A - Enoch Godfrey</p>
<p>Lots # 1, 2 &amp; 3 - John McLean</p>
<p>Lot #4 - Alexander Gunn</p>
<p>Lot #5 - Robert MacBeath</p>
<p>Lot #6 - John MacLeod</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>On 1936-09-16, Elmer Glendenning was granted 100 acres, Lot #7s.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This would be John<span>=</span>s woodlot.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The front half of this property was owned by Thomas Patterson.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Jubal Watling, Jr. was granted Lot #30, 100 acres, on the south side of Black River on 1881-04-20.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Next to Jubal, towards the highway, were Gardiner Archibald, Lot #29, granted in 1880-05-10 and Richard Hutchison, Lot #28, granted in 1849-0604.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Next to Jubal, up river, was Donald Cameron on Lot #31 granted in 1854-01-30.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Canobie</b><b></b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I cannot find any original grant to John Glendinning therefore, he must have purchased from someone else. <span>A</span>Pioneers of the Bay Chaleur<span>@</span> says he bought part of Lot #7 in Salmon beach; this land was granted originally to Fidele and Joseph Arceneau in 1812-06-01.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The<span>@</span>Pioneer Book<span>@</span> also says that John Glendinning sold his land in 1855 in Salmon Beach to Abram Buttimer and was granted land in Canobie in 1868</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Lot #31, 100 acres, in Canobie was granted to John Glendinning, Jr. in 1868-08-17 so it appears that the property was put in the son<span>=</span>s name.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>It was not unusual for early settlers to live on land for a number of years before receiving title;<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>they may have even been required to clear a number of acres and even build a house.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Lot #30, 100 acres, in Canobie was granted to Water Glendinning in 1873-02-17.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Lot #28, 100 acres, was granted to Atton E. Glendenning on 1901-07-06.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Would this be, Dad, Alton E. Glendenning?</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The lots in the area were as follows:</p>
<p>Lot #36 - Norman Peters</p>
<p>Lot #35 (E) - Norman Peters</p>
<p>Lot #35 (W) - F.W. Ellis</p>
<p>Lot #34<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>- John Jagoe</p>
<p>Lot #33 - J. McCarthy, Jr.</p>
<p>Lot #32 - J. McCarthy, Jr.</p>
<p>Lot #31 - John Glendinning, Jr.</p>
<p>Lot #30 - Walter Glendinning</p>
<p>Lot #29 - H. Knowles</p>
<p>Lot #28 - E. Glendenning</p>
<p>Lot #27 - Timothy Savage</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Other Questions</b><b></b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The bridge at the foot of the hill at Norman<span>=</span>s is known as the Millers Bridge.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>What is the origin of the name?</p>
