  John Watling Descendants (1)
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Extended genealogical research on descendants of John L. Watling (1825-), Don&#x27;s ancestor. Details his immigration from England, marriage to Jessie Carruthers (1849), and census records tracking the family through 1871. Demonstrates Don&#x27;s genealogical methodology and family connections.</div>

<p><b>Descendants of John L. Watling</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>First Generation</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>	1.<b>	John L. Watling<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b> was born in Dec 1825 in Syleham, Suffolk, England. He was christened on 6 Mar 1825 in Syleham, Suffolk, England. He died before 1920 in probably Ayer Junction, Massachusetts.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>John was employed as<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>a plasterer/mason.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>It is presumed that John Watling died before the Watlings made the Atlantic crossing in June of 1830, as<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>he does not appear in any New Brunswick records.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That is, unless he did not make the crossing or<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>settled somewhere other than NB.</p>
<p>There is another possibility, however. A John Watling appears in the 1851 NB Census. That census<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>shows him in Napan, an immigrant of 1845 and the husband of Jessie (Carruthers). Perhaps our John<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>stayed in England for some years before he immigrated to Canada. Some members of the family believe<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>this to be true. Below is what I know about the family of John and Jessie (Carruthers) Watling, to err on<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>the side of caution.</p>
<p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>- John Watling married Jessie Carruthers at Napan in June 1849, as reported in the 26 June 1849 issue<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>of The Gleaner and Northumberland Schediasma. Jessie was the daughter of James Sr. and Jane<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Carruthers.</p>
<p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>- In the 1851 Census, John is listed with his wife Jessie in Napan, with a 1 year old daughter, Janet N.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Watling.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>- In the 1861 Census, John and Jessie are listed in the Parish of Newcastle with: Jennet (aged 11),<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Robert (aged 8), Susan J. (aged 5), and Mary A. (aged 2). Also, a 16 year old Jennet Edge (presumably<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>of the Black River Edges), was their servant.</p>
<p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>- In the 1865-66 and 1867-68 Hutchison Directories, John is listed as living on McCallum St. in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Newcastle, a mason by trade. He does not appear in the 1871 Lovell Directory.</p>
<p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>- Neither John nor Jessie appears in the 1871 Census. However, Robert , Jennet, and a William appear<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>in Newcastle. Robert was employed as a clerk, living with the family of John Fish. Jennet and William<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>appear in the household of James Fowler. Susan and Mary Ann appear in the household of their aunt<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>and uncle, Emily (Watling) and William Eddy in the Bathurst area.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>-<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A John Watling, aged 41, appears in the 1870 US Census as a boarder in Newton, Massachusetts.</p>
<p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>- On 5 December 1871, Robert Watling died at Newton, Massachusetts, aged 18, according to the 13<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>December 1871 issue of the Union Advocate.</p>
<p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>- In 1873, John is listed as a mason in the Newton, Mass., directory. His daughter Janette is listed as a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>dressmaker.</p>
<p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>- On 10 Nov 1875, at Dover, Massachusetts, Jennet N. Watling married Frank E. Crafts of Reading,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Massachusetts, according to the 15 December 1875 of the Union Advocate.</p>
<p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>- The 1880 US Census lists Jennet and Frank Craft living in Reading, Massachusetts, with a son,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Clinton W. Craft (aged 3).</p>

<p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>- Could this family be the same John Watling family? The ages of John and William correspond with<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>earlier records. However, Mary must have been John's second wife. The couple appears again in the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>1900 Census (see below), which indicates they had been married 30 years at the time of the census, or<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>about 1870 - the same year given for their immigration to the USA.</p>
<p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>- In 1884, John is listed as a Mason in the Milford, Mass., directory (address: South Natick).</p>
<p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>- In 1884-1885, he's listed as a Mason in the Middlesex County directory (address: South Natick).</p>
<p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>- In 1887, John L. Watling, mason, can be found in the St. Augustine, Florida, city directory - perhaps in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Jacksonville?. The family was still living in St. Augustine in 1892, for John's three children were<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>enumerated that year in a census of school-ages children.</p>
<p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>- John Watling is listed in Fitchburg, Mass., directories starting in 1898 (though he certainly could have<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>been there much earlier). He appears there in directories or census records almost annually until 1911.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>In 1911, under his name in the same directory it says "removed to Ayers Junction."</p>
<p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>- The Fitchburg, Worcester County, Mass. Census for 1900 contains the following entry:</p>

<p>have resided elsewhere.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>John married (1) <b>Jessie Carruthers<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b> daughter of John Sr. Carruthers. Jessie was born about 1829 in Napan, NB. She died before 1870 in probably Newcastle, NB.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>They had the following children:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>+	2	F	i.<b>	Janet Nickolson Watling<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b> was born on 28 May 1852. She died after 1930.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p>	3	M	ii.<b>	Robert Watling<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b> was born about 1853 in Newcastle, NB. He died on 5 Dec 1871 in Newton, Massachusetts.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>	4	F	iii.<b>	Susan J. Watling<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b> was born about 1856 in Newcastle, NB.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>At the time of the 1871 Census, Susan and Mary Ann were living in the Bathurst area<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>with their aunt and uncle, Emily (Watling) and William Eddy.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>In 1881, there is a Susie Watling from N.B. living in a boarding house with several<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>other NB women in Waltham, Mass. (working for the Waltham Watch Co., as so many<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>young Maritime women did). She's the right age to be John's Susan.</p>
<p>There is a record for a wedding for Susie J. Watling in Waltham, Mass., in 1882. Could<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>this be our Susan?</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>	5	F	iv.<b>	Mary A. Watling<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b> was born about 1859 in Newcastle, NB.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p><br></p>
<p>The 1880 US Census indicates that William was "Idiotic." I can find no reference of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>him anywhere after this time.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>John married (2) <b>Mary Jane Ward </b>. Mary was born in Feb 1842 in New Brunswick. She died in 1908 in Fitchburg, Massachusetts.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Surname Ward comes from her death record in the Massachusetts State Archives.</p>
<p><br></p>

<p>John and Mary had the following children:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>+	7	F	vi.<b>	Emily Gertrude Watling<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b> was born on 25 Jan 1873. She died on 22 Aug 1961.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p>father's address of Highview Street in the Fitchburg Directories for 1909 and 1910.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The Fitchburg Directory for 1911 says she had "removed to Ayer Junction." I could<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>find no record of her after this time.</p>
<p>*****</p>
<p>In 1892, Lizzie was enumerated, along with her brother and sister, in St. Augustine,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p><br></p>
<p>The 1900 Census suggests that Janet first came to the United States in 1867 at the age of 33. The 1910<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Census says she came in 1872. The 1920 Census suggests that she came in 1870 and was naturalized<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>in 1875. The 1930 Census suggests she come only in 1880! The spelling of her name varied from<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Census to Census. I have used Janet.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Janet married <b>Frank Edward Crafts<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b> son of Nathan Crafts and Serena Houghton on 10 Nov 1875. Frank was born on 19 Aug 1852 in Newtonville, Massachusetts. He died after 1930 in probably Reading, Massachusetts.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The name of Frank E Crafts is found on a list of passengers sailing from Halifax, NS, to Boston, MA, on<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>the S.S. Halifax, from<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>26 to 28 September 1903.</p>

<p><br></p>
<p>He was still living at home with his widowed father at the time of the 1910 census. The Fitchburg<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Directories for 1909 and 1910 list Herbert J. as a musician. The Fitchburg Directory for 1911 says she<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>had "removed to Ayer Junction."</p>
<p>At the time he registered for the draft during the latter years of the First World War, he was married and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>living in Jacksonville, Duval County, Florida.</p>
<p>In 1920, John Herbert was living in Ortega, Duval County, Florida, and working as a marine machinist.</p>
<p>In 1930, J.H. Watling was an "inmate" in the Florida State Hospital in River Junction, Gadsden, Florida,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>the state's first mental institution; he may have suffered from mental illness, or have been stricken with<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>tuberculosis or some other such illness. His wife was living in Jacksonville with her mother and daughter<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>at the time, and listed herself as widowed. Perhpas John Herbert was dead when she was enumerated;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>I can't be sure.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In the 1929 Directory, there is a Pearl M. Whatland, stenographer - this must be the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p>*****</p>
<p>In 1892, Herbert was enumerated, along with his sisters, in St. Augustine, Florida, in a census of school-</p>
