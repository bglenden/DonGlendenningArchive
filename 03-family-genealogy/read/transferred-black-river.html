<p>Hi Don;</p>
<p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>It's been ages since I heard from you. Glad to hear all is well in PEI. Are you ready for Christmas yet? I finished all my shopping on Saturday because I am working all week. I really have to spend this winter organizing my geneology and updating it. Maybe when Christmas is over and all the activity dies down. As for the picture I do think we have a pic of a bridge, not sure which one though. My brother has a scanner so will get him to scan it for you. I am going to have to get one in the new year sometime.. It is really nice to see a Merry Christmas now, all it seems to be now is Happy Holidays, but they don't specify which holiday it is, all this pc business is really getting on my nerves. So I say a MERRY CHRISTMAS right back at you and hope God blesses you and all your loved ones this Christmas and into the New Year.</p>

<p>Don,</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I have collected the following information.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Would you know if the Buckleys</p>

<p>The Williston Sawmill At Black Brook In Loggieville</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>John Thomas Williston of Bay Du Vin formed a partnership with his brother</p>
<p>Phineas in 1833 and erected a water powered sawmill at the mouth of Black</p>
<p>Brook in Loggieville.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In 1849 Alexander Fraser purchased the mill from the</p>
<p>Williston brothers.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Alexander Fraser was commonly known as Galloping Fraser</p>
<p>due to his constant running back and forth between the mill and the wharf on</p>
<p>horseback to oversee the operations.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>His mill was destroyed by fire in</p>
<p>1855.</p>
<p>In 1856 Galloping Fraser made another attempt at the lumber business.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He</p>
<p>erected a new steam powered sawmill this time at St. Andrews Point on the</p>
<p>river front.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It failed to prosper for him and he sold out to Peter Mitchell</p>
<p>of Newscastle.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In 1872 Robert Alexander and John Stewart purchased the</p>
<p>mill.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Next Guy Bevan controlled the mill until the New Brunswick Trading</p>
<p>Company purchased it about 1888.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The Trading Company built a large store in</p>
<p>front of the mill which was later enlarged and remolded to become the</p>
<p>Terminal Hotel.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In 1889 the mill came into the hands of the Bank of</p>
<p>Montreal.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In 1896 George J.Vaughn bought the mill for $15,000. which</p>

<p>Hello Don:<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Firstly, let me apologize for the delay in replying.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Now, in respect to the barn.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My father told me that a barn located in the pasture on the high ground, just south of where the Old Pine Tree stood, blew down in a cyclone. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I think he used some of the lumber from that barn to build the shed on the back of the main barn, near the house. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He also mentioned that there had once been a house near that barn, and that it had been sold to Mr. Jack Gibson and became the summer kitchen on the back of Mr. Gibson's homestead.<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>I understood that the house and barn had been build by my father's uncle Enoch Godfrey, who later married and settled on the south side of the river in Centre Napan.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span class="Apple-converted-space">            </span>I remember that someone spoke of the cyclone that damaged the Victoria Bridge, and it may have been the same storm. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I cannot comment on the year, either on the barn or the bridge, but 1932 would be a probable year.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span class="Apple-converted-space">            </span>I have searched the photos from home but there is nothing of the Cameron School or the Cameron Bridge. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I also mentioned it to Barbara, and the only suggestion is Helen Mac Lean.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span class="Apple-converted-space">            </span>Otherwise, it was great to hear from you. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I hope to be in Black River for the Mac Knight reunion at the end of August - all things being equal.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The very best regards, Ed Godfrey.</p>
