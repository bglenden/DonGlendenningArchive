<p>Grace Elizabeth (Glendenning) Smith</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Grace was the oldest in the family and was born in Parksville, Tennessee.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Dad and Mum had set up housekeeping there in February 1911 where Dad worked on Ocoee #1, the first of three dams build on the Ocoee River.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Aunt Janet had journeyed to Parksville to be with Mum when Grace was born. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>When Grace was young, Dad and Mum moved from construction site to construction site in the US and, presumably, Grace attended school wherever she was; one school was t</span>he Armstrong School but I am not sure if it was in Connecticut or Virginia.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The family returned to NB in 1919 and, again, presumably Grace attended the Little Branch School.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Later she attended Success Business College in Moncton, NB where she took a business program.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>While she made good marks, apparently she did not like the program.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was when returning from Business College with Grace, that Dad upset the Model T at Gilbert’s Corner, near Shediac.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Grace broke her wrist but even so, went to a dance in the Little Branch School that night.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Like so many other Maritimers, Grace went to Boston to work, probably in 1930 and worked for various families caring for children and likely cooking.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>. On her first trip, she traveled with Mrs. F. A. Fowlie and Ernest MacLean who were going to Lowell, Mass to visit relatives.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She may have she stayed for a while with Dad’s cousin, Sam Knowles.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>At one time she lived at 1595 Beacon Street, Beverley, Mass. She frequently visited her Uncle Jack Watling in Boston and later when he lived on Swan’s Island near Eastport, Maine.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Grace returned regularly to Little Branch for the summer coming sometimes by steamer from Boston to Saint John, NB.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>(I believe that the fare to Saint John was $10.00)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In 1947, when I left home for Teachers’ College in Fredericton, I inherited Grace’s steamer trunk – and it carried my belongings on a number of later trips.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>As a young woman in Little Branch and later in Boston, Grace loved to square dance; Lillian said that the night she landed in Boston in 1933, she went to a dance with Grace.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Perhaps that is where she met Roy Morrison Smith (1908-1985). <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Roy, I believe, preferred to round dance. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She and Roy were married in St. Paul’s Presbyterian Church on August 26, 1936.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In 1936, Walter, Dad, Elinor and I drove to Boston to bring Grace home.<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>After marriage, Grace and Roy lived with Roy’s mother in Saugus, Mass, later moving to 23 Spring Street in Malden. While in Saugus, Grace worked for Chisholm’s Motel on Route 1. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>One evening while standing on the sidewalk near her home in Malden talking to a neighbour, a man came along, knocked her off her feet and stole her purse. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Grace, Roy and family were frequent visitors to Little Branch and even when they could not come, their children made the trip.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My recollection is that Barbara and Lawrence spent 16 consecutive summers with their Grandmother at Little Branch.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Often they came by train but also frequently traveled with expatriate New Brunswick folk who were visiting family in the Miramichi.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I can remember being wakened in the middle of the night when Grace arrived home.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She had brought some clothes for me and wanted to see them on me.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The story is told that one summer when Grace was home and helping with the cooking and Ken was a toddler, Grace would jam Ken’s dress in the pantry door in order to keep him out of her way.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In later years, Grace frequently landed home carrying shopping bags with fresh tomatoes from Roy’s garden, bagels for Jean MacKenzie and the usual things for family members. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Grace had extraordinary eyesight. While walking through a field she could reach down and pick a four leaf clover. One time she entered a contest, which required her to count the dots in a picture of a TV.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She won, and then decided she should count the dots again in case she was asked the number at the presentation ceremony.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I know that she also won other contests but cannot recall which ones.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As a youngster, I can recall going with Grace and others to pick blueberries and raspberries and of walking through the fields.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I am not sure if we were going somewhere or just for a walk.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Although she left New Brunswick as a young woman, she did not lose interest in family, friends or the community.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She subscribed to the Chatham Gazette for many years and was well informed about activities among her extended family. She was proud of her family, fiercely loyal, generous to a fault and she and Roy always welcomed and provided shelter for the many visiting family members.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She was quick to arrange for visitors to see the Museum of Science, visit down town Boston, see the Saugus Iron works, etc. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>During her later years Grace had a form of multiple sclerosis and had difficulty walking.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She then moved to Cliffside Nursing Home and Winthrop, Mass.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She is buried in the Black River Cemetery.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Roy Smith</b></p>
<p>Roy was born in Malden, Mass. where he attended public school and graduated from Malden High School.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Roy worked for nearly 20 years for Benjamin Moore Paints, and then moved to the Englander Mattress Co. where he worked as a mattress retiring in 1973.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Following retirement, he worked for a number of years in retail sales at Sears in Malden</p>
<p>Roy was very active in St. Paul's Episcopal Church, and was a member of the retired Men's Club of the Church.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>During his younger years, he was an avid horseshoe player participating and winning in competitions throughout the state.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>His hobbies included model trains and coin collection.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Roy also enjoyed travel to New Brunswick where he enjoyed the peace and quiet of the countryside and visiting family and friends.</p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Walter Jubal Glendenning<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>Walter was born in New Brunswick; Mother had come back from Tennessee to New Brunswick for his birth and may have stayed in NB until late 1916 – we do not know for sure. The family returned permanently to Little Branch in 1919 and it is likely that is where Walter started school -.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is likely that he only went to school for 6-8 years and then would have worked with Dad on the farm.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Walter did not talk much about his early years but I know that he worked long hours both summer and winter.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Because Dad was such a worker and Walter was the oldest boy in the family, I am sure that a great deal was expected of him.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He had a team of dogs, Chowder and Pup, which he hitched to a sled in winter and traveled around the community, and cross to visit Alex Newton.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Once he took Dad across to George Adams’ to use the phone. The longest trip, Walter said, was to John W. MacNaughton’s – a distance of about 7 miles. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Canobie and Black River Glendenning family members kept in touch and visited back and forth. One time, the Christmas, 1938 I believe, Walter was taking family members to Chatham in the Model A.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The right front window was broken and was replaced with a piece of cardboard.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Seems to me that Mum, Ken, Norm, Lillian and I were in the car.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As we neared the railroad tracks, Walter spotted a train approaching from the right.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He tried to stop but the car kept sliding towards the tracks.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Quick thinking, he tramped on the gas instead and got across just ahead of the train.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>People on the back of Adams’ truck just ahead of us were sure that we were going to be hit.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Walter began building a home on the Dan MacLean place in 1937 and moved into it on November 1, 1940.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In the meantime, they lived at Little Branch.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The basement was dug with the aid of a horse, Jess, and a scoop and most if not all of the lumber came from Hallidays.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The original barn on the property burned in 1932, the same year as the Black River Hall.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>His house was struck by lightning in 1940 but did not burn.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Although Walter farmed, he also worked off the farm.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In 1940 he worked at clearing the bombing range along the Loggieville Road.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He was called to the Army Service Corps during the war and was stationed at Ottawa, Halifax, Debert and Camp Borden.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>On his return, he continued to farm and to work at the airport.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In 1950 he commenced work with Modern Construction Co. Ltd. In 1959 he moved to Moncton and continued to work for Modern at job sites throughout New Brunswick including their head office in Moncton.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He retired in 1978.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Dad was one of the promoters of farmers working together and was Secretary Treasurer of the Agricultural Society #103.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Part of the role was to maintain a “store” from which seeds, etc. would be sold.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>After Dad died, Walter took over the role and moved the shed from the Branch to his place.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Walter and Agnes always welcomed visitors – family and friends alike - and they were good hosts.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A meal seemed to appear effortlessly and Walter encouraged visitors to “eat up and give the house a good name.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He liked to travel and visit family and friends in Bathurst, Rexton, Harvey Station and down to the Boston area. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He also traveled widely stopping to see men he had worked with. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>For a while they owned a cottage in the Caissie Cape area. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Walter is also remembered for his keen memory.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He seemed to remember anyone he ever worked with, perhaps even met, and would visit if he was passing nearby.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He enjoyed reminiscing but talked little about what himself. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Walter loved to visit the old home, “The Branch.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A few years ago, when he was not able to drive, I arranged to pick him up for a day’s outing.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When we got into the car I said, “We can go any where you would like.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Would you like to go to the Island?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Saint John? Fredericton? Springhill? Or where?”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He hesitated only for a moment then said, “I think that I’d like to go to the Branch”.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>.</p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Agnes (Gibson) Glendenning</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Agnes was born in Black River and attended the Middle Black River (Cameron) school and was a member of St. Paul’s Presbyterian Church; like so many young women, Agnes went to Boston to work (She had relatives there) but came home most summers.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I remember one year of Agnes coming to our place driving her brother’s (?) car.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Cannot remember the make but it would be a 1930-something with extra wheels mounted on each front fender complete with silver spokes and whitewall tires.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>In the late 1950’s, Walters work transferred him to Moncton.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Shortly thereafter, Agnes enrolled in the RNA program at the New Brunswick Institute of Technology; she worked at the Moncton Hospital retiring in 1976.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Agnes also had an eye for antiques.</p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Venetia Katherine (Glendenning) Russell</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Venetia was born at Little Branch.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Mum and Dad were living in Little Branch at the time.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Venetia attended the Little Branch School for Grades 1-8, the highest grade available in the Little Branch School, and then she<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>stayed with Aunt Tine in Loggieville where she completed Grade nine.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Following that, she wrote Entrance Exams and gained First Class Entrance to the Provincial Normal School from which she graduated in 1933.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As I recall, Venetia taught in New Carlysle, Napan, Penniac and Bayside; she may also have taught somewhere north of Fredericton.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She also taught in Point Aux Carr, Little Branch, Miramichi Rural High School and Chatham retiring in 1975.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Quite a number of people at her wake mentioned that Venetia had been their teacher.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Venetia was active in her church, St. Paul’s Presbyterian.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She probably attended Sunday school at St. Stephen’s Presbyterian Church prior to it becoming St. Stephen’s United Church.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When St. Paul’s opened in 1930, there was a PYPS rally prior to the church opening. And Venetia was President of the Young Peoples Society.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The local paper, presumably the Chatham Gazette, noted, “Miss Venetia Glendenning, President Black River Y.P.S, in a very pleasing manner welcomed the delegates…” Venetia was a member of St. Paul’s since its establishment, played the organ for many years and for 40 years was Church Treasurer.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She was also a member of the Women’s Missionary Society and the Women’s League.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Venetia met Cameron Russell (1906-1979) in the spring of 1932 at Little Branch.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Cam was rafting logs for Harrison Murdoch and they tied up at the wharf.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Cam and perhaps other members of the crew came over to talk to the girls in the schoolyard.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They married in St. Paul’s Presbyterian Church and lived in Point Aux Carr in a home they bought from Mrs. Simon MacDonald.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Mrs. MacDonald retained a room which she used mainly in the summer.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Cam and Venetia had three children, Glenn, Leonard and Donna.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Venetia was an avid reader, a good listener and a good sport.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She was a good conversationalist but not one to gossip or be critical of others.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She demanded nothing, asked little and offered much.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She did not complain and was always “fine” when asked about her own health.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She did not want to bother people.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She could entertain herself and did not mind living alone.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In fact, she lived alone for 20 years after she became a widow.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Venetia was a resource for information about her community and we shared an interest in genealogy; she provided me with much of my initial information about the Watling side of the family.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She could recall family relationships from memory whereas I have to rely on my notes and records.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Venetia and Cam had many trips to Florida with Ken and Verne.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When lighting her stove to warm the house on return from one trip in 1989 or 1990, the house caught fire and burned.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She rebuilt on the same site.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Venetia and Cam visited Donna and Vernon when they lived in Vancouver and later in England and, while in England, traveled with the family by car around Europe. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>As a youngster, I recall the nice table Venetia set at mealtime.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A visit to Venetia’s always ended in lunch before leaving.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Sometimes when visiting the Miramichi in recent years, I would drop in on Venetia’s about 8:00 am and enjoy toast, jam, tea and conversation.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She kept scotch cookies in her freezer and always set some out when she knew I was coming for a visit.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Cameron Russell</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Cam was born and lived all his life in Point Aux Carr.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He was a fisherman – smelts in the winter and salmon in the summer.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>At one time he fished just off-shore from where he lived but the fishing by set nets was banned and he “drifted” for salmon.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He also farmed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When courting Venetia, he would often bicycle to Little Branch only to be asked to a barber to the Glendenning boys.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>He played the fiddle at dances in the local school, served as an elder in St. Pals Presbyterian Church and also sang in the choir.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>For years he represented St. Paul’s Church on the Black River Cemetery committee</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Lillian Elspeth (Glendenning) Weeks <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Lillian was born at 3 Perkins St., Fairhaven, Conn., USA, where Dad was working at the time.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She would have traveled with the family to Hampton, Virginia and Muscle Shoals, Alabama before returning to Little Branch in 1919.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She attended Little Branch School for a few years but admitted that she did not like school. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>In school, students required a slate cloth and water to main clean slates.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Once Lillian dropped her slate cloth and instead of picking it up, tied the ankle of the student in front of her to the leg of the desk.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When the teacher called the girl to come to the board, the slate cloth tripped her.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Dad was returning from Moncton; Lillian was with him and maybe others.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Near Rexton, a car tried to run him off the road.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Lillian thought that they were rumrunners but perhaps the rum was inside them rather than just in the car.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Dad pulled in to a store/gas station and phoned the RCMP.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A police car came from Newcastle.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Lillian remembered riding in the police car as far as John W. MacNaughton's.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Lillian was a close friend of Maxine Macdonald and they used to visit back and forth.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>One of Mum’s tricks was to ask Lillian to take a note over to Maxine’s mother.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She dutifully carried the noted a half-mile to Maxine’s place.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She did not know it at the time, but the note simply said “Please send Lillian home after a while.”</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>At age 16, Lillian was glad to go to Boston to work.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Ken remembers the phone call from her sister, Grace, who was living on Beacon Street at the time, saying that there was a job for her in Boston; Walter took Mum, Venetia and Lillian to catch the train at Newcastle.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She arrived in Boston on September 22, 1933 and, I think, stayed with Dad’s cousin, Sam Knowles, for a while.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That night, she went to a dance with Grace and Roy to celebrate Grace’s 22<sup>nd</sup> birthday. (Dates don’t quite match)</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>While in Boston, Lillian did housework and looked after children first for Mrs. Fineberg, who was a singer, and later for Mrs. Piser.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Her last employer was Mrs. Walker where she worked for 5-6 years.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>One of her addresses was “61 Mayo Avenue, Needham.”</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Brydone and Lillian met on April 18, 1933 while Lillian was visiting with Aunt Tine in Loggieville.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There was a service in the United Church and afterward the young people played badminton.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Brydone walked Lillian back to Aunt Tine’s.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They courted for over 6 years.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Lillian came home most summers but Brydone also visited her in Boston.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In 1936, Brydone and Walter traveled to Boston by train stopping to visit in Portland on the way.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Brydone and his mother drove Lillian back to Boston in 1936 after Grace’s wedding.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I can remember Brydone coming to court Lillian in his Dad’s car (a 1935 Ford perhaps); I would hang around the front door and as they got into the car.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Occasionally, Brydone would invite me to get in and go for a ride.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Sometimes the ride would include a trip to the “Bayshore” and end with a cone of ice cream.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Lillian and Kenneth Brydone Weeks (July 6, 1917 – Sept 16, 1994) were married at Little Branch on December 22, 1939. by Rev. P. McK. Sampson, Minister of the Sunny Corner Presbyterian Church and they lived in Loggieville.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Shortly after, Brydone enlisted in the North Shore Regiment.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Lillian lived for a while in Woodstock, and Sussex as well as Camp Borden.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She and the family lived in Loggieville (13 Church Lane?) while Brydone was overseas.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Lillian was a people person.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She was active in her church.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She enjoyed company, was a great conversationalist and enjoyed both hearing and telling jokes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Although she did not play any musical instrument she often sang while working around the house.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She also sang in the choir and I can still hear her singing The Old Rugged Cross.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Lillian, Brydone and daughter, Patricia, frequently led special church services with readings and song.</p>
<p>Lillian was a note-maker.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She maintained a record of dates of events from her community and from Black River.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In 1974-75, Lillian typed 144 pages of memories of her early years.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In 1995, I arranged for them to be printed and she gave copies to family and a few close friends.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Among other things, Lillian remembered visiting Bird Hill to observe the “Zepplin”, a German dirigible pass on its way to New York.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That is the dirigible famous for having burst into flames while moored in New Jersey.</p>

<p>Brydone was born in Loggieville and graduated from the Loggieville High School.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>For a number of years he worked for A&amp;R Loggie Company delivering groceries and feed with one of his regular routes being Loggieville to Escuminac.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>People would phone in their orders and Brydone would deliver.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Once or twice he took me with him and bought lunch while in Escuminac.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was quite a treat.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Brydone always wanted to farm and after leaving the army purchased a dairy farm near Harvey Station.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Brydone was always active in his church and, in late 1964; Brydone accepted a call to minister in a three-point Presbyterian charge with a manse provided in Stanley; Lillian and Brydone lived there until their retirement.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>After Brydone retired, Lillian usually accompanied him when he substituted throughout Southern New Brunswick for ministers who were ill or on vacation.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>After Brydone died, Lillian moved to Harvey Station, then with Ken and Beverley but eventually moved into a senior’s home in MacAdam.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Their homes in Harvey Station and in Stanley were favourite stopping places when traveling through to Boston – as well as just for family visits.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I frequently stayed there.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In fact, at Easter of 1955, I was visiting when Mum phoned one night to say a letter had arrived saying that I had won a Beaverbrook Overseas Scholarship. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p><b>John Franklin Glendenning<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b><b></b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>John was born at Little Branch shortly after the family returned to Canada.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He attended the Little Branch School probably for 7 or 8 years, and then he worked on the farm.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Dad had not been well for a number of years so Walter and John did the farm work.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>John and Walter hauled fish from Hardwicke to Chatham, cut hardwood on the “ridge” and delivered it to Loggieville and Chatham.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>One day they would go to Hardwicke or Baie St. Anne (including Fred Savoie’s) and bring fish back to the Branch; the next day, they delivered the fish to Chatham for $5.00 per ton (two box-sled loads).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They went to the woods and cut and split a cord of hardwood and the next day delivered it to Loggieville or Chatham for $5.00 including the cost of the wood.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>John worked hard and put in long hours.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He expected others to do their bit whether it was bringing in the wood for the stove, doing barn chores, going to the woods in winter, making hay in summer, etc.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was expected and you did it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But he was also very generous to people needing help. <span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>In the late 1930’s John, along with some other young men from Black River including Tom Harper, Theodore Fowlie, took an agricultural course in Newcastle.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The course included practical farm mechanics, agriculture, book keeping, general mechanics and woodworking.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As part of the course, John made a beautiful birch desk, which he finished in walnut.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I also remember that he learned a new technique for killing chickens.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I believe that it was then or shortly thereafter, that John rigged up a wind generator on the roof of the barn which would charge a battery and provide light.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>One winter, November I believe, he and Brydone Weeks (Brydone was home on leave, probably before he went overseas) built a tractor out of an Oakland front end (a car that belonged to Alex MacDonald) and a Godferson rear end (a truck used by the A&amp;R Loggie Co) – and they did this in Walter’s old shed without the aid of welding and cutting equipment (or heat). The tractor had two transmissions.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The tractor was very powerful but the too heavy for soft ground.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>During the winter of 1945-46, and perhaps winters previous to this, John, Ken and Norm all worked in the woods for Hubert Matchett of Sunny Corner.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They would be gone all week and I did the barn work.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>As a young lad going on 17, I went to work on the boats in Chatham loading pulp and pit props.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>(I am sure that I got my first job based on the reputation of John, Ken and Norm.)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>One day we were storing 8-foot props down in the hold.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They are heavy enough anyway but these were also moldy; I was struggling and John knew it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>John said, “Let me take that one, Donald”.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And it happened many times. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>For a number of years John went from farm to farm along the Miramichi pressing hay, first with a horse powered hay press but later with a press operated off a tractor.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>(When pressing hay at home, it was my job to keep the horse moving and to prevent it from grabbing at the hay when it went past the end of the bundle.)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Bundles of hay weighed between 80 to 120 pounds.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>John worked all around Black River, Napan, Barnaby River, Cains River, etc.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>For a number of years, John owned a 3-ton Dodge truck, which I believe he bought from Hubert Matchett, and trucked pulp, pit props, gravel, lime, fertilizer, hay and Christmas trees.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>In 1946-47 John and Mary built a new house on the Bob MacLean property and in the spring of 1948 opened a store in their living room.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In 1968 they built a new store nearer the road and put in gas tanks.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>John was very entrepreneurial selling groceries, flour, feed, plumbing, furnaces and anything else to make a buck.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>John received his call for military service and, I believe, went to Fredericton for a physical.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He had very poor eyesight and was turned down.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He probably would not have had to serve anyway, because farming was an essential service and he was needed at home.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Ken and Norm were already in the Service and I was too young to take over the responsibility of farming. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>When Ken and Norm were in the service, I was the only one around to help with the farm work.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Since Dad died when I was very young, you might say that I learned to work under John’s direction.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I recall going to the woods in the winter, sitting on the bob-sled and on the load of wood on the way home, building loads of loose hay and poisoning potato bugs early in the morning to take advantage of heavy dew.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>John was the only one of the boys who would sing while driving to and from the fields or woods – I especially remember him singing familiar hymns.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Many of the older people in Black River will remember the 1939 Ford half-ton truck that, as I recall, John purchased from Bonnie Flanagan.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was a far cry from the old Model A.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The truck had wooden cab on the back and John would take people to town on Saturday night when the stores were open.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There could be a 10-12 people in the back.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I think that he charged one dollar.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The last thing before leaving town, he would drive up Water Street and past Ben’s Canteen to see if anyone needed a lift home. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>John and Mary liked to visit family and friends around the Miramichi and Bathurst.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>John and Mary, with Margaret and Jeannie, made their first trip to Florida over Christmas of 1958.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Carol and I went with them to help with the driving.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Later, they managed to visit Florida for a month most winters always stopping to see family and friend in Florida and on the way.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When our children were small and we visited Black River, John always had gave the kids a candy or some change just as we were about to drive away.</p>
<p><b>Mary Watling</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>John met Mary when she attended a service at St. Paul’s with her cousin, Millie MacDonald.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He took Mary back to Point Aux Carr that night.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>John and Mary were married at the Branch on January 27, 1944 and lived at the Branch for a while.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The day of, or day before, the wedding, John went in town to do some last minute shopping.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was raining and the roads were icy.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>An RCMP vehicle went through a stop sign and clipped John’s truck. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Mary grew up and went to school in Point Aux Carr, she also attended Sunday school which was held in the school.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As part of a large family, Mary took her turn doing all of the chores including those in the barn as well as the house.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Mary was a true partner with john in running their country store; John opened the store about 6:00 am while Mary got breakfast; john went in for breakfast about 8 and Mary took over in the store.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was a full-time job for both of them.</p>
<p><br></p>

<p><br></p>
<p><b>Elinor Jean (Glendenning) Taylor</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>Elinor, her Dad called her Nen, was born after the family returned to Canada; she attended the Little Branch School to the end of Grade 8.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She then wrote High School Entrance exams and attended high school classes in Bay du Vin. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>She usually walked to Bay du Vin, a distance of 5 miles, but sometimes rode her bicycle.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In the winter she boarded at Barbour Williston’s.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>On a beautiful sunny day in early September, 1935, I walked with Elinor to my first day at school.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She wrote and passed her Junior Matriculation.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>By 1933, Grace, Venetia and Lillian had left home and Elinor would have been the only daughter at home to help Mum. With Dad and five boys at home, while still going to school, and without electricity or running water, the work would have been heavy, indeed.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Elinor met Earl <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>when he worked and stayed at home.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They lived at the Branch until, I think, Earl went in the army then they bought a house on Harriman Lane in Loggieville.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As best I can remember, Elinor stayed in Loggieville all the time Earl was in the service.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>In the summer of 1949, Elinor and Earl and family moved to Black River.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Alex MacDonald had been killed in an accident and W. S. Loggie Company held the mortgage on his property.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Elinor turned over their house in Loggieville to Loggie's and paid the difference - $300.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I moved their belongings from Loggieville to Black River in the 1949 red Chev ½ ton truck.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>On one trip, we stopped to see Norm who was cutting grain in the field below John’s house.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>As her family got older, Elinor did housework for a number of people in Chatham and at CFB Chatham.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She also worked at the Miramichi Seniors’ Home in Chatham and at the Rehabilitation Centre.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Elinor was active in St. Paul’s Presbyterian Church being a member of both the Women’s League and the Presbyterian Missionary Society, a member of the Women’s Institute and an active Member of the Black River Community Hall Committee.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The hall had burned and a new building was constructed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>(This was the second time that the Black River Hall had burned.).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She phoned me to tell me about the fire; a few days later she went into the hospital and died after a brief illness.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Once when having supper after a day digging potatoes, we were sitting at the dining room table.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Uncle Jim was there because it was the custom for neighbours to exchange labour while cutting wood, threshing, picking potatoes etc.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was dark so there was an oil lamp on the table.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Elinor went to reach across for butter and poked her knife through the lamp globe.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Of course, the flame went out as a result of the air rushing in.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Elinor wrote regularly when I was in England and her letters were always newsy.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>At Christmas of 1955 – my first Christmas away from home, I recall coming back to the residence late on Christmas day to find a letter waiting for me from Elinor.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>(Only in England would mail be delivered on Christmas day.)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She also wrote a letter every day to her son, Robert, when he lived in Toronto.</p>
<p>Elinor was a “high-energy” person – some may say it was a nervous energy.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She was a good worker, had a quick turn of mind, was fiercely loyal, and quick to support or defend family members.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She also had a temper.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Once when she was young, Mum sent the youngsters upstairs to make their Valentines.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>(Ken says that Jamie Mortimer and Ward Godfrey were at home at the time).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Elinor and Norm had a spat and Norm tried to take the scissors from her and cut his hand.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Elinor enjoyed hockey and was a fan of the Montreal Canadiens.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She was a good letter writer and wrote to her son, Robert, every day but two during the years he lived in Toronto.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I forget the reason for the first day she did not write but the second was the day she was admitted to the hospital just before she died. The following tribute was written by Mrs. Donald Angus MacDonald.</p>
<p><i></i><br></p>
<p><i>To Elinor</i></p>
<p><i>Today I stood beside your silent bier,</i></p>
<p><i>Sweet fragrant flowers, tokens of esteem</i></p>
<p><i>Brought me thoughts of other days,</i></p>
<p><i>I see again your ready smile and kindly ways.</i></p>
<p><b><i></i></b><br></p>
<p><i>I feel your hand upon my arm</i></p>
<p><i>To aid me down the steps.</i></p>
<p><i>And see your keen and friendly interest</i></p>
<p><i>In every one you met.</i></p>
<p><i></i><br></p>
<p><i>You gave yourself to every worthy cause.</i></p>
<p><i>Your untiring energy you could not stay,</i></p>
<p><i>Our whole community is a richer place</i></p>
<p><i>Since you have passed this way.</i></p>
<p><i></i><br></p>
<p><i>The Master called you to a higher post</i></p>
<p><i>But this is not the end,</i></p>
<p><i>We’ll meet again, and you will know</i></p>
<p><i>How proud I am, that I have called you friend.</i></p>

<p>Earl grew up in Napan and attended the Napan school.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As a young man, he worked around Napan and later did general farm work for Elmer Glendenning including haying, barn work and cutting wood in the winter.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He joined the army in 194? And, as I recall, was stationed in Fredericton, New Brunswick. Earl was discharged from the army on February 15, 1946 and worked at the Chatham air base.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p><br></p>
<p>Earl had purchased a beautiful cream, chrome and red bicycle – double bars, handle bars and all.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was a far cry from the old bicycle which Walter had as a kid and which we, and half Black River, learned to ride on. Sometimes Earl would take me on the parcel carrier; sometimes he even let me take it by myself.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>One evening, just at dusk, he took me across to the field just behind Uncle Jim’s shed where Uncle Jim was burning piles of brush</p>

<p><b>Kenneth Elmer Glendenning</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Ken attended the Little Branch School to the end of Grade 8, took classes in the Bay du Vin Hall and graduated from MRHS.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>One year he stayed with Venetia and Cam in Point Aux Carr, went to school, and did the chores while Cam fished smelts.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>After High school, Ken took a business course in Newcastle</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>In 1943, Ken enlisted in the RCAF; he phoned Mum from Moncton and, as I recall, Walter, Mum and I saw him at the Newcastle station when the train stopped briefly.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>His first posting was to Toronto for basic training then to Galt for technical training as an airframe mechanic; later postings included St. John’s, Quebec and Scoudouc, New Brunswick.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He brought an airman from BC home for Christmas that first Christmas.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>After demobilization, he worked on the Miramichi including winters in the woods for Hubert Matchett and summers loading pulp and pit props on the boats...<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>In 1948 he took a carpentry course in Moncton and, after doing carpentry work for a while, in 1950 he re-enlisted in the RCAF and his postings included Trenton, Calgary, Armstrong, Resolute, Moncton, Greenwood, Ottawa and Chatham.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He retired from the air force after having a stroke.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>In October 1939, Ken and I both came down with scarlet fever a week apart.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I think the quarantine period was 6 weeks - a red warning sign was posted by the front door. We shared the bedroom on the ground floor.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Then Ken came down with complications and I was moved to the small bedroom upstairs.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That was the time that “Old Jess”, our faithful old horse, was put down.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Ken did all the usual farm work including collecting sap from which Mum made maple syrup.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I recall going with Ken with a horse and sled, with cream cans and the barrel from the churn, to collect sap before we went to school in the morning.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Ken has stories to tell about Venetia catching him when he tumbled out of the car on a turn in the Bathurst Road, getting pecked near an eye by a hen, and Wallace MacDonald’s visit to the Little Branch School. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>While in the service, Ken worked as a carpenter in the evening and on Saturdays wherever he was posted; he built his own home in Napan, Venetia’s home after her fire and a home for his in-laws after their fire.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He pitched in to help others building homes, barns, sheds, etc.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Ken has a great memory and likes to recount jokes and stories of yesteryear.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I often check with him on items about family tree information.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He attends in local political meetings.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>At age 80 he purchased a computer and has learned the intricacies of email, games, and the internet and later he registered on Facebook.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Ken and Verne are regular participants in the seniors' card games at the Black River Hall and impromptu games either at their home or the home of friends.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When in the service, he was an active curler.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>.<b>Verne Taylor</b><b></b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>In 1946 he married Verne Taylor from Napan who he had first met at a dance.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Verne taught school before she was married including school in Upper Black River. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Ken and Verne are active members of St. Paul’s Presbyterian Church and Ken has been Clerk of Session for 27 years. For years they picked up Venetia and Edith Bremner every Sunday for church and still take Edith on a regular basis.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Verne was also active in the Women’s Missionary Society.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They are active in the senior’s organization and are ardent supporters of church suppers in the Miramichi.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She also plays auction 45 and is a good cribbage player.</p>

<p><b>Norman Peters Glendenning<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>Norm was born on New Year’s Eve, 1925, however, when the birth was registered; it was given as December 31, 1926.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Grandmother Glendenning was a Peters hence his second name. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>According to Lillian, Mum and Dad had difficulty deciding between the names Norman and Robert.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Norman attended the Little Branch School, classes in the Anglican Church in Bay du Vin and the Miramichi Rural High School.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Before school bus service was established, Norm used to take a horse to Bay du Vin, and later Bayside, picking up other students along the way.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The horse was stabled for the day in either Goymer Williston’s or Harrison Smith’s barn. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>At age 18, he enlisted in the army and found himself in the RCEME being sent first to Camp Utopia outside Saint John, New Brunswick and later to Woodstock, Ontario and Longueil, Quebec.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Norm was a good skater and a good dancer, and usually took me along when I first started going to dances in 1946. I also remember working with Norm at the hay; in the woods on cold and snowy Saturdays; butchering and peddling meat; shearing and dipping sheep and whatever else needed to be done. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Among Norm’s stories is one about Wallace MacDonald throwing a peavey at him and Edwin Adams, trips on icy roads up river with Mr. Harper to tend to a sick horse and the first time he drove a vehicle with airbrakes.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Norman married Jean Watling from Point Aux Carr.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Alton and Eric now operate the farm although Norm continues to “supervise” and run errands; most every day he makes a trip to Miramichi City.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Branchview, the Glendenning farm, is the largest farm east of Miramichi and one of the largest in the Miramichi area.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Branchview has been the recipient of a number of awards. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Norman and Jean always welcome family to the old family home providing a place at the table for children, siblings, grandchildren, nephews and nieces alike.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He always tells visiting children where the kittens were and offers to give them one to take home.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Many young people of the community earned some money and learned important work habits while working on the farm with Norman and the “boys”. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Norm’s early years were filled with long evenings of farm chores on top of full days driving truck for Alfred MacDonald or with John pressing hay.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>For a number of years Norman served as a trustee of the Black River Community Hall including during a major renovation in the 1960’s and reconstruction in the 1970’’s; was a director of Agricultural Society #103 and was a Director of the Northumberland Cooperative Dairy.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He participates in local political meetings.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Although not one to travel, in “retirement” he takes time to visit neighbours and friends around Black River.</p>
<p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p><b>Jean Watling</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Jean was born in Point Aux Carr and attended the Point Aux Carr school.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As a member of a large family, Jean did her share of house and farm work.</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>Norman and Jean are active in their community and are members of St. Paul’s Presbyterian Church; Jean has been a member of the woman’s Missionary society for more than 40 years and Norman is a Trustee.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>At age 59, she got her first drivers license and often drives her sister, Mary, to Point Aux Carr for a few days in Mary’s cottage – especially when other family members are home.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Their home and their camp are the scene of family gatherings especially on holiday weekends.</p>
