  Dad purchased a Model T
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Documents Elmer&#x27;s automotive acquisitions with specific details: Model T Ford (purchased from MacLennan&#x27;s Garage in Chatham; salesman took Grace for test drive before purchase); 1929 Model A 2-door Sedan (purchased from Babineau sisters who operated Chatham cinema). Includes vehicle registration reproductions (1928 Model T, 1938 Model A). Narrative anecdotes: Elmer and Walter cutting wood at Bay du Vin River to earn car money; Model T upset at Gilberts Corner near Shediac (Grace broke wrist when Elmer was bringing her home from business college); Model A stored in wagon shed (possibly due to recession); allowance of $2.00 weekly gas; technical detail about gravity-fed fuel systems and backward driving on steep hills like Tabisintac. Portrays Elmer as not a very good driver (Aunt Venetia&#x27;s skepticism), with occasional mishaps but practical problem-solving. Contains reproductions and sourced from Lillian.</div>

Dad purchased a Model T. Ford, year unknown, but Lillian (Weeks)
Glendenning thought that he had purchased it from MacLennan’s
Garage in Chatham (At the corner of the Park).  Lillian remembered
that the salesman let Grace tryout the car before Dad bought it. 
Sometime after 1931 he purchased a 1929  Model A 2-door Sedan –
purchased, I believe, from the Babineau sisters (The Babineau's
operated the movie theatre in Chatham.)  According to both Walter and
Lillian, the car was purchased on the day that Annie MacDougall died.

Walter worked with Dad cutting wood up Bay du Vin River to earn money
to buy one of the cars; I cannot recall which one.  Shown above are
the 1928 registrations for the Model T Ford and in 1938 for the Model
A. Ford  Thanks to Lillian (Glendenning) Murray for access to the
original documents.</p>

The gas tank for the Model A, and perhaps for the Model T, was just
in front of the windshield and gas flowed by gravity to the engine. 
On very steep hills, the Tabisintac for example, the car had to be
turned around and driven backward up the hill.  .  Dad upset the
Model T at Gilberts Corner, near Shediac, the day he brought Grace
home from business college.  The Model A sat in the old wagon shed,
presumably because of the recession.   Walter said that Dad allowed
$2.00 worth of gas each week but I do not recall for what year.  Gas
pumps of the day were pumped by hand to fill a chamber at the top of
the pump.  The gas then flowed by gravity through the hose to the gas
tank on a car.</p>
