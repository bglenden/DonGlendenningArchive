<p><b>JANE ELIZABETH JARDINE WATLING</b><b></b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Jane Watling was born, presumably at<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>home, at the Meadows, Upper Black River, New Brunswick on February 28, 1890. Although her name was Jane, it seems that Dad always called her Jean.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This may account for the fact that the Watling side of the family continued to call her Jane (or Janie as Uncle Ern called her) while the Glendenning side of the family referred to her as Jean.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I remember Mum saying that Dad referred to her as "Jeannie with the light brown hair".<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Agnes has an annual report from St. Stephen's Presbyterian Church (now United Church), which shows the name as Jane.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Jane was the second youngest of a family of eight born to Jubal Watling and Grace MacAskill MacDonald. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She was named after Jane Elizabeth Jardine who married Donald Cameron (Cameron Russell<span>=</span>s grandmother)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A few years ago when visiting Francis and Phyllis MacNaughton in Vancouver, Phyllis showed a framed, handmade embroidery (?) made by Jane Elizabeth Jardine.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>When Mum was about 10 years old, the family moved from the Meadows to the Branch.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We know that she went to school in Upper Black River; it is unlikely that she went or went for very long to the school at the Branch.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I remember Mum saying that her mother would take her from school to help Aunt Elspie MacNaughton who had a young and growing family and needed help.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Portland, Maine</b><b></b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Jane Watling arrived in Portland on January 24, 1908 just prior to her 18th birthday.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In the same way as Maritimers now do to Ontario, points west or overseas, in those days young people went to "the Boston States". Young women frequently were employed to look after children and to do housework.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The exact date that of her arrival in Portland is known only because she arrived there on the day that the City Hall burned. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I have since confirmed, through a phone call to the Portland Public Library, that the fire occurred on January 24, 1908.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>(I also recalled Mum saying that she could have gone to Walter Glendenning's funeral (which was on February 14, 1908.) <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Jane arrived at the train station in Portland in the early morning and waited for her brother, George, to meet her. Apparently he came to the station but did not recognize her. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She had grown up while he was away from Black River.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Her brother Jack also worked in Portland at that time and likely there were many cousins. We also know that her brother Jim worked in Portland in a chemist/pharmacy, and also in photography, but whether he was there at that time we do not know. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Among Mum’s possessions was an envelope mailed in , Wisconsin addressed in Dad’s handwriting showing Mum’s address as 130 Emery Street, Portland.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>We think that Mum worked for a Mrs. Jennison and looked after her two sons, Marshall and Brian.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We do not know the dates.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In 1952, John and Mary took their son, Frankie, to Boston to see a doctor.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Mum and I went along.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>While there, we visited a friend of Mum<span>=</span>s.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It may have been Mrs. Jennison.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She lived on the second or third floor of a brick apartment building on the southwest side of Boston.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>(Worcester near Framingham, perhaps ?)</p>
<p><br></p>

<p><br></p>
<p><b>Friends</b><b></b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Among the friends identified through old family photos are the following:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Mrs. Jennison</b>, I believe was the person Mum worked for when she went to Portland in 1908.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Presumably Mother looked after the children - there appear to have been 2.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Marshall Walker who was born, I think, in 1906; William Brackett who was born about 1908 and graduated from high school in Portland in 1925.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In 1949, I think, we (Mum, John&lt; Mary, Frankie, Rankine Smith and I) visited Mrs. Jennison who then lived in an apartment building in Worcester, Mass. Just outside Boston. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> 		</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The <b>Ratcliffe</b> family (presumably the <b>Goldie</b> Ratcliffe with whom maintained correspondence after returning to Canada) family was living at 3437 Wildwood Ave., Cleveland, Tenn.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In 1913.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They appear to have had at least two children: Bernice Naomi born in 1913; Vance born in 1915.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The <b>Kennedy</b> family lived at one time in New Haven, Conn.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Based on the photos, they likely also lived in Tennessee.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We know of at least two children: Bernice born in 1912; Harmas (?) Lee Reginald born in 1912 - 1914</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>One photo is of Harmas Lee Reginald Kennedy and Vance Ratcliffe was taken when they were youngsters (under two years of age).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Obviously the families were friends.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Mr. and Mrs. <b>Courtney</b> and a son Lennie who likely lived at the time in Tennessee or Alabama.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Mrs. Lawrence </b>who appears to have had at least 4 children: Helen, born about Jan or Feb. 1914; Henry (perhaps also known as Harry) the oldest of the children; John born Nov. 23 1909; Elizabeth born in Jan or Feb 1914</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Nellie Fountain </b>provided a photo taken in Portland, Maine.</p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Millie Tredenic</b>, I believe, was from Prince Edward Island.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The phone book shows people by that name living on PEI today</p>
