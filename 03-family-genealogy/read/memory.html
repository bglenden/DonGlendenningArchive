<div class="reader-summary">Humorous story about two elderly people (widower and widow) meeting at a community supper in a Florida mobile home park. After the widower proposes and the widow says yes, he cannot remember her response the next morning and must call to confirm. She had also forgotten who asked her. A charming tale celebrating memory loss, romance, and humor in later years. Found in Family Tree Maker folder (possibly misfiled), suggesting this sentimental story may have resonated personally with Don during his own later years. Likely represents either creative writing or a favorite story Don wanted to preserve.</div>

<p>This is a story of two elderly people living in a mobile home park  <br>
in Florida.  He was a widower and she was a widow.  They had known  <br>
one another for a number of years.<br>
<br>
One evening there was a community supper in the Club House, and the  <br>
widower and widow made a foursome with two other singles.<br>
<br>
They had a wonderful evening and spirits were high.  The widower  <br>
sent a few admiring glances across the table, and the widow smiled  <br>
coyly back at him.<br>
<br>
Finally, he plucked up his courage to ask her,  " Will you marry me? "<br>
<br>
After about six seconds of careful consideration, she answered,  <br>
"Yes. Yes, I will. "<br>
<br>
The meal ended with a few more pleasant exchanges and they went to  <br>
their respective homes.<br>
<br>
The next morning, the widower was troubled.<br>
<br>
Did she say 'Yes' or did she say 'No'? He couldn't remember. Try as  <br>
he would, he just could not recall.<br>
<br>
He went over the conversation of the previous evening, but his mind  <br>
was blank.  He remembered asking the question, but for the life of  <br>
him he could not recall her response.<br>
<br>
With fear and trepidation, ! he picked up the phone and called her.<br>
<br>
First, he explained that he didn't remember as well as he used to.   <br>
Then he reviewed the lovely evening past.<br>
<br>
As he gained a little more courage he then inquired of her,  " When  <br>
I asked if you would marry me, did you say 'Yes' or did you say 'No'?"<br>
<br>
"Why, you silly man, I said 'Yes.  Yes I will.'  And I meant it with  <br>
all my heart. "<br>
<br>
The widower was delighted. He felt his heart skip a beat.<br>
<br>
Then she continued,  " And I am so glad you called because I  <br>
couldn't remember who asked me.</p>
