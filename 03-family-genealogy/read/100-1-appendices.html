<p><b>Books that Made a Difference<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>As a youngster, I was an avid reader.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>One Christmas, that of 1938 I believe, I received 8 books as Christmas gifts.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I’ve continued to be an active reader although in later years I read more newspapers and periodicals than books.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I consider a book to be of value even if it only reveals one new idea.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The names and authors quoted in the following paragraphs may not be entirely correct since, at time of writing, I am in the process of disposing of my memorabilia, including books, and no longer have ready reference to correct titles. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Books are expensive, but the lack of new ideas in our lives, and in our schools, is costly.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Reading is one way to expand idea generation. Any book that sparks even one new idea is a very good investment,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I found the following to be particularly useful.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span><b>The Free Child by A. S. Neill</b></span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>A. S. Neill, a Scot, was principal of Summerhill, an independent private English boarding school founded in 1921 in Leiston, Suffolk, England.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Summerhill was a residential school serving youngsters who had been turfed out of their regular schools because they were disruptive; it was their last chance school.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>(I decided to Google Summerhill and, yes, it is still in operation and still as controversial as ever.) <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Summerhill catered to upwards of 100 students ages five to eighteen, it was run as a democracy, students were not required to attend classes and could do whatever they liked provided it did not impinge upon the rights of other students.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A centerpiece to the school was a daily meeting about school governance in which every student and staff member had an equal vote. Lessons were optional and students decide what they want to do with their time.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Students appeared to waste a lot of time but, once they decided to learn, they soon caught up.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span><b>The Eight Year Study.</b></span><b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>This reports the results of an eight-year longitudinal study of students in the USA through four years of high school and four years of university.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Thirty high schools were involved during the period 1933 t0 1941 along with 250 universities and colleges.. Secondary schools were given freedom to initiate innovative practices in student testing, program assessment, student guidance, curriculum design, and staff development; colleges agreed to suspend their normal entrance requirements. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The traditional high school graduation requirements could be opened up without damaging a student’s chances of success in college.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>My recollection is that, generally, students from the innovative high school programs did as well academically as students from more traditional programming; moreover, students from the experimental schools achieved beyond those from traditional schools in the non-academic aspects of college life.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>My conclusion was that the emphasis, which still exists today, on a rigid pattern of subjects required for high school graduation cannot be defended.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Inventing Education for the Future by Werner Z Hirsch</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Shortly after moving to Prince Edward Island, I was invited to make a presentation to the staff at the Saint John Institute of Technology.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>While on the ferry crossing Northumberland Strait, I opened a book, Inventing<span> Education for the Future,</span> that I had borrowed from the Holland College library and started to read. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I was captivated; in fact, I found it so interesting that I asked my wife to drive the remainder of the way to Saint John.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The first three to four chapters are especially interesting, although I cannot, for the life of me, recall the exact model the author was describing.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I am still a believer that, in a large measure, individuals create their own education through what they choose to learn and what they choose to ignore. A change in the school system would likely make the invention process easier and more rewarding.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Teaching and Learning by S. R. Laycock<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>A short, readable book by <span>R. S. Laycock</span> (one time Dean of Education at the University of Saskatchewan). on educational psychology.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This book, I believe was a textbook at an early stage of my learning; it certainly piqued my interest and improved my understanding of the teaching learning process.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Education and Democracy by John Dewey </b>emphasized the importance of one's beliefs or philosophy as "the single most important thing to know about a person."<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Education as a Subversive Activity by Neal Postman</b> caused a chuckle with his comments on "returning to the fundamentals" in education; I also frequently recalled the questions each teacher should ask every day.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>What will I do today with students which will make a difference in their lives? What difference will it make? How do I know?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Evaluative Criteria</b>, published by one of the accreditation societies in the USA, provided a practical check list for evaluating schools.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As part of my studies at Indiana University, I participated in a school evaluation as a member of an evaluation team.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Setting Instructional Objectives </b>by Mager was popular in the 1960s and probably set the stage for my transition to competency based education.</p>
