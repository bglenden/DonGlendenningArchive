<p><b>North Shore Regiment</b><b></b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Recently I found a History of the North Shore Regiment by Will. R. Bird (Brunswick Press, 1963).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I found it fascinating especially the part dealing with WW2.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Certainly Archie MacNaughton received high praise as an officer and as a person.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I was intrigued, also, by the following references:</p>
<p>The Chatham Gleaner of July 14, 1843 made reference to <span>A</span>a disgraceful scene at Black River after the drill and muster there<span>@</span></p>
<p>A rifle competition on August 17, 1868 with competitors from Black River and Chatham.</p>
<p>The Northumberland County militia reorganized in 1869.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>No. 4 Company was from Black river under Capt. Jeremiah Ullock, Lt. Hugh Cameron and Ensign Robert MacNaughton.</p>
<p><br></p>
