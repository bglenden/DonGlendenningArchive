<p lang="en-GB" align="center"><b>LIFE
AT LITTLE BRANCH</b></p>
<p lang="en-GB" align="justify"><br />

</p>
<p lang="en-GB" align="justify"><br />

</p>
<p lang="en-GB" align="justify"><br />

</p>
<p lang="en-GB" align="justify">I
believe that Elmer and Jane Glendenning returned to New Brunswick in
1919 although I do not know the exact date nor even if they travelled
together.  Named and dated photos in Mum’s collection, show that
the family was in Mussel Shoals, Alabama in the earlier part of 1919.
 John was born on December 14, 1919 in Black River; the younger
children would have been there as well.  So the move must have
occurred earlier that year.  One might assume that the family moved
at latest during the summer so that the children, at least Walter and
Grace, could enrol in the Little Branch School by September.  They
already had a house waiting so temporary accommodation following the
move would not have been a major problem.   Discussion with siblings
suggest that their return was in May, 1919.</p>
<p lang="en-GB" align="justify"><br />

</p>
<p lang="en-GB" align="justify">Dad
had purchased the property at Little Branch, where Norman Glendenning
now lives, from Alexander and Ethyl MacDonald.  Sometime in 1914, the
family took up residence in Black River for a couple of years before
returning to the USA again in late 1916.  Who lived in their property
during their absence, if anyone, we do not know. 
</p>
<p lang="en-GB" align="justify"><br />

</p>
<p lang="en-GB" align="justify">Their
property was known as the Jessie MacDonald property.  &quot;Miss
Jessie&quot;, who was a schoolteacher, died in 1912.  This property
was directly across the road from where mother had lived as a child
and where her father and mother still lived.  The western property
line, starting at the Little Branch School, forms the back property
line for many of the properties along Black River.  The rear of the
property was known as Jessie's Corner - probably at the rear of
either the Godfrey or Gibson property.   While I have not completed
my search or county records, I believe that the property passed from
John MacDonald to Jessie and on her death from Jessie to her nephew,
Alexander MacDonald who sold it to my father.</p>
<p lang="en-GB" align="justify"><br />

</p>
<p lang="en-GB" align="justify">The
original house, owned by Miss Jessie, was a traditional “story and
a half” with a gable roof and built end on to the road.  Dad added
an ell, likely in the early 1920’s; by 1920, they had five children
and the house must have been very crowded.  Most if not all of the
lumber for the addition was cut on the property, including a hardwood
for the floor and pine for pantry cabinets.  The space added to the
main floor included a large kitchen, pantry, back entry and another
stairway to the second floor.  A basement was included under the
entire house.  Two bedrooms and a large closet/storage room were
added on the second floor; As I recall, that closet was considered a
likely location for a modern bathroom.  He also added a closed-in
veranda along the entire front of the house.</p>
<p lang="en-GB" align="justify"><br />

</p>
<p lang="en-GB" align="justify"><br />

</p>
<p lang="en-GB" align="justify"><br />

</p>
<p lang="en-GB" align="justify"><br />

</p>
<p lang="en-GB" align="justify"><br />

</p>
<p lang="en-GB" align="justify">The
barn was also enlarged by doubling its length and adding a shed at
the back and included stalls for five horses, a new set of large
doors to a new “barn floor”, haymow, and some pigpens.  At some
point a machinery shed and workshop was added to the west end of the
barn, and a henhouse and grain shed were built as separate buildings.
 And of course, one must not forget the two-hole outhouse.</p>
<p lang="en-GB" align="justify"><br />

</p>
<p lang="en-GB" align="justify">During
his lifetime, Dad added purchased five pieces of property in the
community; he now had a place for each of his sons.  
</p>
<p lang="en-GB" align="justify"><br />

</p>
<ul>
	<li><p lang="en-GB" align="justify">Dad
	had purchased the property at Little Branch, where Norman
	Glendenning now lives, from Alexander and Ethyl MacDonald on July
	21, 1914 for the sum of $800.00.  
	</p></li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li><p lang="en-GB" align="justify">On
	June 11, 1924, he purchased 18 acres of land from James Finno for
	the sum of $900.00.  
	</p></li>
	<li><p lang="en-GB" align="justify">On
	July 27, 1929 he purchased the &quot;Mac&quot; place from Jane
	MacDougall.  Venetia thought that the property, up to Hexham corner,
	was owned by Jane and Anne MacDougall.  Later Bob and Bioney
	MacDougall moved to the house at Hexham from their place down on
	MacDougall’s Point beyond Harper's.</p></li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li><p lang="en-GB" align="justify">He
	purchased about 70 acres of land, with 12 acres cleared, from Dan
	MacLean.  Dan, who was a Great-Uncle to Everard and Harry MacLean
	who are residents of Black River, lived on the property with his
	sister Lizzie.  When Dan died, Lizzie moved to the &quot;poor
	house&quot;.  Agnes (Gibson) Glendenning remembers when Dan died -
	likely in the early 1920's.  Walter built a house there in 1938 and
	1939 and he and Agnes lived there until 1958.</p></li>
	<li><p lang="en-GB" align="justify">In
	1931 Dad purchased a property from Bob Mac Lean, Dan's brother.  The
	arrangement allowed Bob to live in the house until he died. 
	According to the agreement, Bob was able to keep some barbed wire
	fencing (This was before herd-law and fencing was needed to protect
	ones crops from roving cows.); he  could also harvest a field of
	oats.  The deed also provided a right of way right of way to the Dan
	MacLean property.  Records show also that Mrs Moodie, Bob’s
	sister?, held a mortgage on the property.  As I recall, Harry
	MacLean discovered Bob dead in the house in the early 1940's.  John
	and Mary built a house on the Bob MacLean property.  The old MacLean
	house was fixed up and is still used for storage</p></li>
	<li><p lang="en-GB" align="justify">On
	November 29, 1926, Dad bought property from James A. and Kathryn
	Watling.  For some reason, the transaction was not registered until
	September 17, 1929.  This property, I believe, was the narrow strip
	of woods between Uncle Jim and Ian MacNaughton.</p></li>
	<li><p lang="en-GB" align="justify">On
	September 9, 1936, Dad purchased a 100 acre woodlot, Lot 7B&lt; from
	the Crown to provide a woodlot for the MacLean property.</p></li>

</p>
<p lang="en-GB" align="justify"><br />

</p>
<h3 lang="en-GB">Mixed Farm</h3>
<p lang="en-GB" align="justify"><br />

</p>
<p lang="en-GB" align="justify">The
farm was a mixed farm, that is it included such animals as cows,
pigs, hens, geese, horses, turkeys; crops included a farm garden,
oats, barley, wheat, buckwheat, and hay.  As a result, income, or
other good through trade, was obtained from eggs, chickens,, beef,
pork, the sale of weaners (Piglets four to six weeks old), geese,
turkeys, ducks, bales of hay, bags of grain, cream, potatoes, furnace
wood, and butter, etc.  In addition, it ensured that the family had
meat and potatoes for their own use.</p>
<p lang="en-GB" align="justify"><br />

</p>
<h1 align="left"><b>Sheep</b></h1>
<p align="left"><br />

</p>
<p align="left">We
always kept a few sheep, perhaps a dozen or so – nor am I sure of
the breed although I know they were white.  The sheep had their own
shed at the top of the hill where we coasted.  It was easy to climb
onto the roof of the sheep shed and jump off into the snow bank,
which curled around it.  
</p>
<p align="left"><br />

</p>
<p align="left">Each
spring there were new lambs, usually twins but sometimes only one;
they always seemed sickly and some had to be nursed with a bottle. 
Sometimes they were brought into the house for a few days,  Some
died.  But they were cute.  In early summer the sheep had to be
sheared.  Sheep shears were hand operated, very sharp and were hinged
at one end not hinged in the middle like a pair of scissors.  I never
sheared   sheep but I helped Norman on at least one occasion.  
</p>
<p align="left"><br />

</p>
<p align="left">One
put a few boards on top of sawhorses.  Sheep were caught and their
front and hind legs were tied together.  Then they were put on the
table and sheared.  Norm was pretty good at it although occasionally
nicked the skin and drew blood.  Sometimes the sheep had ticks and
had to be dusted or sprayed.  They sure looked funny with all the
wool removed.  Shearing sheep was a dirty, smelly job partly because
the wool was so oily.</p>
<p align="left"><br />

</p>
<p align="left">I
remember Norm bringing home half a dozen sheep in the old Model A. 
He had removed the back seat and turned up the seat on the passenger
side.</p>
<p align="left"><br />

</p>
<p align="left">Also
in the spring of the year, we docked the tails of the lambs.  Docking
meant cutting off their tails to leave only a stub.  This was done
with one chop with a sharp axe.  We had small cloth squares, perhaps
a 4-inch square, and a bit of grease was put on the cloth and over
the end of the stump.  This was used to keep the wound clean.

</p>
<h3 lang="en-GB">Cars</h3>
<p lang="en-GB" align="justify"><br />

</p>
<p lang="en-GB" align="justify">Dad
owned purchased a Model T Ford; it had a soft top with curtains on
the side.  Lillian thought it was purchased from  McLennan’s Garage
in Chatham.  MacLennan's garage was located on the corner of the Park
probably the site of MacCarthy's (and Flett's) garage in later years.
 Grace was learning to drive at the time and the salesman took Grace
for a drive in the car.  Lillian remembered travelling with Dad in
the Model T to Moncton to bring Grace and Gladys MacNaughton back
from Business College.  Lil Cormier, a cousin, went with them.  On
the way home, I think at Gilbert’s Corner, Dad upset the car. 
Grace broke her wrist and Dad had some cuts and bruises.  Lillian
also recalled that, on the same trip, they stopped in Rexton on the
way home and had supper with a friend.  On the way home after supper,
they encountered a car load of men who tried to run Dad off the road;
Lillian thought that the med had been drinking and may have been
rumrunners.  Dad pulled into a store and phoned the RCMP in
Newcastle.  Lillian drove back as far as John W MacNaughton’s in
the police car.  She also recalls that there was a dance that night
in the Little Branch School.  Venetia was at that dance.</p>
<p lang="en-GB" align="justify"><br />

</p>
<p align="justify"><span lang="en-GB">In
the early 1930s, Dad bought a two-door Model A sedan.  Both Lillian
and Walter remembered it being purchased from the Babineau sisters,
the Babineau family operated the cinema in Chatham, and was purchased
on the day Annie MacDougall died.  </span>Walter
remembered working with Dad cutting wood up Bay du Vin River to earn
money to buy one of the cars. Shown above are the 1928 registrations
for the Model T Ford and in 1938 for the Model A. Ford  Thanks to
Lillian (Glendenning) Murray for access to the original documents.</p>

</p>
<p align="left"><br />

</p>
<p align="left"><br />

</p>
<p align="left">The
gas tank for the Model T, was just in front of the windshield and gas
flowed by gravity to the engine.  On very steep hills, the Tabusintac
for example, the car had to be turned around and driven backward up
the hill.  .  The Model A sat in the old wagon shed, presumably
because of the recession.   Walter said that Dad allowed $2.00 worth
of gas each week but I do not recall for what year.  Gas pumps of the
day were pumped by hand to fill a chamber at the top of the pump. 
The gas then flowed by gravity through the hose to the gas tank on a
car.  I don’t Dad was <span lang="en-GB">
a very good driver.  Venetia recalled that Aunt Venetia came to New
Brunswick, perhaps for Grace’s wedding.  Dad took Aunt Venetia for
a drive to show her around.  (I think that I went along for the
drive) On her return, Aunt Venetia said she now understood why Mum
did not want to travel in the car when Dad was driving.</span></p>
<p lang="en-GB" align="justify"><br />

</p>
<p lang="en-GB" align="justify"><br />

</p>
<p lang="en-GB" align="justify">Dad
would have earned good money when he worked in construction.  I
vaguely recall seeing a pay envelope one time that showed he earned
90 cents an hour but I am not real sure of this.  Apparently he left
his money in a bank in the USA, perhaps Portland, and lost some money
in the crash of 1929.</p>
<p lang="en-GB" align="justify"><br />

</p>
<p lang="en-GB" align="justify">Patricia
Hubbard wrote the history of the Northumberland cooperative.  In it,
she records some comments by Charles Butler about members of the
Northumberland Agricultural Council.  About Dad, Butler said &quot; a
big man with tremendous capacity for hard work&quot;.</p>
<p lang="en-GB" align="justify"><br />

</p>
<p lang="en-GB" align="justify">Dad
had a team of oxen which he used around the farm.  Lillian remembers
using them to haul sap from back on the &quot;ridge&quot;.</p>
<p lang="en-GB" align="justify"><br />

</p>
<p lang="en-GB" align="justify">Dad
was active in the community including the building of St. Paul's
Presbyterian Church (on June 14, 1926 was elected to the first Board
of Managers (Trustees), was a prime mover in the construction of a
community hall.  The first hall was opened in 1931 and burned to the
ground in 1932.  A second hall was built in 1933.  He was active in
the Orange Lodge, Oddfellows, and Masons.</p>
<p lang="en-GB" align="justify"><br />

</p>
<p lang="en-GB" align="justify">In
addition to farming, he and his brother-in-law, John W. MacNaughton
operated a pulp business. They operated a &quot;rosser&quot;, a
machine for peeling pulp in Middle Black River, across from the
Cameron School, and operated lumber camps in St. Margaret's and the
Black River area. (Across the road from the Cameron school) He
continued to be active in construction and built the bridge at John
Godfrey's and John Dick's. His last job away from home was the
construction of Tinker Dam near Woodstock, NB</p>
<p lang="en-GB" align="justify"><br />

</p>
<p lang="en-GB" align="justify">Elmer
Glendenning was known as a hard worker. He built and repaired his own
harness, re-soled the children’s shoes, and made axe handles. Even
when he was not able to work, Brydone Weeks told that Dad had himself
taken to the field in a wheelbarrow where he sharpened the scythes
while the men were cutting marsh hay.  Dad suffered for a number of
years with pernicious anaemia (or was it leukemia ?).  Walter
remembers the wagon rack breaking one evening when coming from the
woods with a load of wood.  Later he and Dad returned to the woods,
unloaded the wood, cut poles, repaired the wagon rack, and returned
home so that the wagon load of wood was ready to be taken to
Loggieville the next day.  Part of the repair work was carried out by
the light of a lantern.  Lillian remembers Dad up on the roof
shingling at daybreak.  
</p>
<p lang="en-GB" align="justify"><br />

</p>
<p lang="en-GB" align="justify">Ken
recalls that Dad had cleared some land in the back field, behind
where Eric now lives. He had requested a fire permit to burn brush. 
Expecting it in the mail, he decided to go ahead and burn.  The
permit did not arrive; the fire jumped the ditch and got into the
woods.  Dad and others carried barrels of water on a truck wagon from
the river to put out the fire.  John Fowlie, who was the local
firewarden called the RCMP because Dad was burning illegally.  Two
RCMP officers arrived; one was Bedford Peters a first cousin of Dad’s
and the other was Aubrey Falls.  On the way in to Black River,
Bedford had stopped and picked up the required fire permit.  Lillian
arrived home from the USA in the midst of all the commotion.</p>
<p lang="en-GB" align="justify"><br />

</p>
<p lang="en-GB">Jean, Mrs Norman, Glendenning
remembers her Uncle Allie MacDonald telling about working in the
woods with Dad.  Apparently Dad lumbered Willard’s (Jean father)
place the year he bought it.  Allie was on the other end of a
crosscut saw with Dad.  Dad said, ”I don’t mind giving you a
ride, little man, but please don’t drag your feet.”</p>

	Society</h5>
	<p align="left"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="left"><span lang="en-GB">Dad
	was a founding member of an Agricultural Society (#103) and was its
	Secretary Treasurer for fourteen years.  </span>An
	Agricultural Society, and there were many throughout the Province, 
	was like a Co-op.  Farmers banded together and bought seeds, lime
	and fertilizer, etc. in bulk and sold it to themselves.  Seems to me
	that they also handled some agricultural pesticides or herbicides. 
	Farmers were canvassed each winter; their needs aggregated and then
	orders were placed. Lime and fertilizer was ordered by the ton (by
	the boxcar) either loose or bagged.  It came to the station in
	Loggieville.  When it arrived, John, Walter, Ken and Norm would go
	to Loggieville and shovel the lime or fertilizer from the boxcar to
	the wagons for farmers who had bought it.  Later lime and fertilizer
	could be purchased either bagged or loose.</p>
	<p align="left"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="left">Dad
	kept the Agricultural shed.  The shed was well-built with a pitch
	roof, probably 10 to 12 ft wide and 20 to 24 feet long but that is
	only a guess.  It sat by the west side of the lane across from our
	back door.    I remember seeing the bags of timothy, alsike clover,
	red clover, alfalfa, etc.  As Secretary-Treasurer, he kept the
	books.  The only

	to the bobsleds and the shed was taken to Walter’s.  When Walter

		</p>
		<p align="left"><b>By
		Lillian: 	</b><i><b>“Mum
		was the best cook ever.  Having a big family to feed, bread to make
		almost every day, and in those days, a bread had to be set
		overnight, starting with a batter called sponge, in which the yeast
		was mixed into about a quart of flour and let rise.  Quick yeast
		wasn’t used until the war years in the forty’s.  That sure was
		an improvement, so much less time to make bread.  Many times Mum
		would cook hot biscuits and applesauce for breakfast along with
		porriage, fried potatoes, lots of fresh cream.  Mum’s specials
		were Yankee toast (bread fried in molasses) scallop potatoes, apple
		pie baked in a square pan and cream on top.  Do you remember when
		she would bake cinnamon rolls and put a sauce over it before they
		were put in the oven to bake,  How we all loved that for dessert.  
		Then there were cooked cranberries with thick cream on them and hot
		biscuits to eat with it”.  </b></i>

	<p align="left">Dad
	purchased a Model T. Ford, year unknown, but Lillian (Weeks)
	Glendenning thought that he had purchased it from MacLennan’s
	Garage in Chatham (At the corner of the Park).  Lillian remembered
	that the salesman let Grace tryout the car before Dad bought it. 
	Sometime after 1931 he purchased a 1929  Model A 2-door Sedan –
	purchased, I believe, from the Babineau sisters (The Babineau's
	operated the movie theatre in Chatham.)  According to both Walter
	and Lillian, the car was purchased on the day that Annie MacDougall
	died.

	<p align="left">Walter
	worked with Dad cutting wood up Bay du Vin River to earn money to
	buy one of the cars; I cannot recall which one.  Shown above are the
	1928 registrations for the Model T Ford and in 1938 for the Model A.
	Ford  Thanks to Lillian (Glendenning) Murray for access to the
	original documents.</p>
	<p align="left"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="left">The
	gas tank for the Model A, and perhaps for the Model T, was just in
	front of the windshield and gas flowed by gravity to the engine.  On
	very steep hills, the Tabisintac for example, the car had to be
	turned around and driven backward up the hill.  .  Dad upset the
	Model T at Gilberts Corner, near Shediac, the day he brought Grace
	home from business college.  The Model A sat in the old wagon shed,
	presumably because of the recession.   Walter said that Dad allowed
	$2.00 worth of gas each week but I do not recall for what year.  Gas
	pumps of the day were pumped by hand to fill a chamber at the top of
	the pump.  The gas then flowed by gravity through the hose to the
	gas tank on a car.</p>
	<p align="left"><br />

	</p>
	<p lang="en-GB" align="justify">Dad
	suffered for a number of years with pernicious anaemia (or was it
	leukemia ?).  Lillian thinks that his illness was first diagnosed in
	1933.  Doctors prescribed nearly raw liver mixed with tomato juice. 
	He also visited doctors in Montreal.  Mum said that the doctor said
	that he had lived five years longer than they thought he would.  He
	died at home in 1938.  Venetia recalls Mum saying that doctors in
	Montreal congratulated Dr. MacKenzie for diagnosing the problem so
	early. His obituary is included at the end of this document.  Also
	included with the obituary, is a piece of poetry written, I believe,
	by Mrs. F. A. Fowlie on the day that Dad was buried.</p>
