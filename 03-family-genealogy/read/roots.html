<p><b>WATLING ROOTS</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Origin of Name</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>The first record of the name was found in Sussex, England somewhere between London and Dover.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is likely that the name arises from Wartling which was a hamlet in the area but others believe that it was associated with Watling Road, the great Roman Road, which started near Dover, passed through Canterbury, turned north at London and went as far as St Albans <span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>It is thought, furthermore, that the Watlings were Vikings who landed in Northern Scotland in 870 AD, invaded northern France in 910 AD and then came to England with William the Conqueror in 1066.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The name is found in the Domesday Book which was a census taken in England in 1086.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>By the time of Richard 1 the Watling name had spread north to Watlingford in Oxfordshire, Watlington in Norfolk, Essex and Hertfordshire.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Many Norman families moved north to Scotland in the 12<sup>th</sup> century and this might have included some Watlings.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Watling is thought to share the same roots as Whatling, Watlington, Watlingtone, Whatlington, Whatlingtone, Wadling, and Wadlingdon.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Over time, the name spread into the northern parts of England and to Scotland as well.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Kinsmen of the family Watling who came to North America include Ffrances Watling who settled in Virginia in 1660, John Watling who landed in America in 1753, James Watling settled in Philadelphia in 1842 and Mary Watlington who settled in Antigua in 1679.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Some Watlings moved to Canada after the American Revolution.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>The Roger Watling Website includes the following comkments about the origin of the Watlings:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><i>“In the 5</i><i><sup>th</sup></i><i>/6</i><i><sup>th</sup></i><i> century a band of people crossed the North Sea from Europe to the British Isles, we do not know if it was one or more boats, but as a yachtsman sailing these waters I would suppose the latter, there being safety in numbers.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They knew where they were going as trading was and had taken place long before, also they would have had oral stories from their forebearers who might have served in the Roman Legions, without a shred of evidence I like to think that they were Angles, or possibly Jute in origin rather than Saxon.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The leader of this band was WACEAL, and those with him of the same clan, tribe or group were the Waceal – ingas.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Ingas was not the son of as in the Scottish Watson, but meaning people of or followers of Waceal, so members of this group would be referred to as Wacelaingas.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As time past the name began to change from, the vowels hardening, or softening, plus the input of people from other tongues and one form was Waselin.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The earliest records I have are for Norfolk 1086, the DOOM’D DAY BOOK.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In this book is recorded the Manor in the Half Hudred Diss, today scholars call it a lost Manor as its whereabouts are unknown.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>(I have my own theory, but that is another story)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The Manor of Watlingeseta it states was held by the king (William in 1086, and before 1066 Edward the Confessor).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Also recorded in the book is Wazalin who held land in Weeting, Norfolk, one of the few Anglo Saxons still holding land after William the Bastard and his lbunch of land grabbing thugs won the Battle of Hastings.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Watling Street was built by the Romans during their occupation and the name came after the Roman period, the present day town of St. Albans was originally Watlingcaster, but after the martyrdom of St. Alban the name changed, it can be sujpposed that the Wacealingas lived there.”</i><i></i></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Watling Street</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>Watling Street was a major Roman Road built by the Romans after they invaded Britain in 55 BC.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It started at Reculver, near Dover, passing through Canterbury (where a street sign bears the name) and on to London and points north.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>From London, Watling Road runs north and west passing through St. Albans<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>(ancient Verulamium) a distance of about 200 km.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>An Internet source says that Watling Road ran from Dover to North Wales.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Blazon of Arms</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The Blazon of Arms for Watling is described as “</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b><i>“Argent Six Escutcheons Sable”</i></b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>and the crest<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b><i>“Out of a human heart a dexter hand grasping a sabre all proper”</i></b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Coat of Arms</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The blazon of Arms is translated graphically as shown on the following page.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The reader is reminded that coats of arms may vary slightly depending on the artist and modifications by later family members.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Australia</b><b></b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I am reading a book, The Fatal Shore, by Robert Hughes, about the history of Australia.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In it, he talks about Thomas Watling, from Dumfries, Scotland, transported for forging notes on the Bank of Scotland; Watling was a landscape painter who arrived in Australia in 1792. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Watling is quoted a number of times on the barrenness of the country and the conditions in which people lived.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Pious Pirate</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>San Salvador Island is part of the Bahamas.<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>On Sandy Point sits Watling Castle.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The island was originally named Watling’s Island in honour of Captain George Watling a famous buccaneer and pirate.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>(It was renamed in 1926).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He was also known as the “pious pirate” because he would not allow his crew to play cards or indulge in piracy on the Sabbath.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The name Watling appears frequently in literature about the Bahamas.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There may have also been a pirate named John Watling.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I am sure that neither of these were part of our family. (http://www.bahamasnet.com/sansalvador.html)</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>My Connections</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The first Jubal Watling, my Great-Great Graandfather, for which I have information was Jubal Watling married Susan Leach.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They married in Metfield, Suffolk County, England on November 14, 1814.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Later they appear to have moved to Syleham, Suffolk County, England where their son, Jubal was baptized on August 17, 1823.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I believe that Jubal and Susan stayed in England, although I do not know for sure.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A note in Kenneth Watling’s database says that Jubal Jr. migrated to the USA -<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>we do not know the year.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Suffolk, England</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Suffolk County was described in 1812 as follows:</p>
<p><b><i>"Suffolk, an English<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>HYPERLINK "http://www.genuki.org.uk/big/eng/SFK/map.html" </i></b><span><b><i>COUNTY</i></b></span><b><i> 47 miles in length and 30 miles in breadth, bounded on the West by Cambridgeshire, on the North by Norfolk, on the South by Essex and on the East by the German Ocean. It contains 575 parishes, 28 market towns and sends 16 members to Parliament. The air is generally wholesome, but the soil is various, on the sea coast it is sandy and there are several small hills which yield hemp, pease and rye. The inland parts are clayey and more full of trees. The borders towards Essex are fit for pastures and the NW produces corn of all sorts. There are manufactures of several kinds, particularly all sorts of broad-cloth, stuffs and coarse linen. The principal rivers are Little Ouse, the Waveney, the Stour, The Breton, the Orwell or Gippe, the Ore and the Blyth. Ipswich and St.Edmundsberry are the principal towns".<br>
