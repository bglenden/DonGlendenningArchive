</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Email (January 4, 2008) from Bonnie Hamilton to Don&#x27;s genealogy group responding to his update on Harley family research. Hamilton discusses Mary Anne Harley Henry&#x27;s 99th birthday interview, missing family members, the William Harley who moved to Upper Canada, and her own research in Ireland (Courtmacsherry, Rathclarin parishes) connecting Knowles and Harley families. Mentions meetings with William Harley (author of family history) and discoveries about marriage arrangements across Courtmacsherry Bay. Shows Don&#x27;s role orchestrating multi-person genealogical investigations.</div>

<p>Hello Everyone,</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Just a few observations off the top of my head as my notes have been packed away while I have been occupied with other pursuits over the last few months. However, now that winter seems to be setting in in earnest, this would be a good time to get back to my research.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Reading through Don's notes has reminded me that Mary Anne Harley Henry indicated in her 99th birthday interview that she had two brothers and three sisters. Even if we find conclusive evidence that Elizabeth and Margaret were her sisters, we are still missing another sister. If my calculations are correct the one that died on her 94th birthday is not accounted for.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The Harley family members of Miramichi seemed to have been fairly prominent. Therefore, I wonder why the local papers transcribed by Daniel Johnson, didn't give any coverage to the death of Ann Bidders Harley. Perhaps her death predated some of the newspapers. In Ireland I saw a volume of Coshe Mang that listed a marriage for an Ann Bidders at about the right time frame but it was to a Denis Harley. I am hoping that one of the Toronto libraries will have copies of the Coshe Mang volumes so I can explore further.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>By one of those strange quirks, I worked in the early 70's with a colleague who is a direct descendant of the William Harley who moved to Upper Canada from Miramichi. One of her relatives (also named William Harley) has compiled a family history in which he suggests a relationship to the Harley's of Harley Street in London.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Incidentally, if anyone has a current contact for Robert Stevens, I would appreciate getting in touch with him. A few years ago he was planning to transcribe a diary of one of his ancestors (I think, Frederick Stevens) in which references were made to Knowles cousins in Clifton. It would be interesting to find out what was said about them.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I was in Courtmacsherry, very briefly in September, while I was looking for Knowles ancestors. Courtmacsherry is on the south side of Courtmacsherry Bay and was the location of the Earl of Shannon's summer home according to Nora Hickey who very kindly drove me around the area. I did find the parents and two siblings of William Knowles who married Elizabeth Harley. The Rathclarin Parish records show the baptism of a daughter, Elizabeth Knowles and a son Richard but although the records cover the time frame of William's birth, his name was not there. Elizabeth was a surprise as our Knowles family lore made no mention of her, at least as far as I can recall. She may have died young or married and stayed in Ireland. I suppose it is also possible that she might have emigrated under her married name and have been part of the New Bandon Community as well. As the Knowles family lore has always indicated that the family came from Bandon, it may be that the younger children of William Knowles, Sr. and his wife Hannah were baptised in one of the two Bandon area parishes. I understand that it was customary for a woman to return to her parents' home for the birth of her first child so her mother could help her through the birthing.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Rathclarin Parish is on the north side of Courtmacsherry Bay which cuts deeply inland and I had wondered how people from the north side would have had opportunities to meet and marry those on the south side. Nora Hickey said that many marriages were arranged, that people often met at local fairs held to market produce from the area. She also pointed out that when the tide is out, one can ride across Courtmacsherry Bay on horseback.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I have read recently that the name Hannah is often interchangeable with the name Jo(h)anna. Has any one found this to be so?</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Best Wishes and Happy New Year to all,</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Bonnie Hamilton</p>
