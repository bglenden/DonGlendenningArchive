<p><b>BLACK RIVER CONNECTIONS</b><b></b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>A. W. MacDougall says that the name Black River, in the MicMac language is AMat-quan-ti-gook - a term intended to describe its waters.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In the early days, Black River was a large area including Bay du Vin and point Aux Carr but now embraces only the communities along both the north and south sides of the river - a distance of 10 to 15 miles.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>McDougall describes at least one lot, at McDougall's Point near the mouth of the river, which was granted to Delesderniere and Marsten prior to 1784.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The first settlers were United Empire Loyalists coming to Black River between 1785 and 1795.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Following this, there arrived mostly people from Scotland, highlanders and lowlanders alike including MacDonalds (McDonalds), MacNaughtons, McBeaths and MacLeans.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Many came directly from Scotland while others came to the Miramichi via Cape Breton or Prince Edward Island.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The Black River flows from west to east and empties into Bay du Vin, which is part of the Miramichi River.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>By 1800, grants had been made to settlers along the shores from Hexham east.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In 1812, there was a major push to settle the Black River including the Little Black River now known as the Little Branch.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Settlements on the upper reaches of the Black River came a decade later and the Meadows closer to mid- century.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Some specific settlement dates are found later in this chapter.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Miramichi Place Names</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>Information about early place names of the area was taken from Geographical Names of New Brunswick, 1875. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Chatham</b> was once known as Spruce Tree after a large Spruce tree growing on Water Street.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The name changed to Chatham about 1800 after William Pitt, the Earl of Chatham, Prime Minister of England.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Although <b>Wells Brook</b>, <b>Weldfield</b> and <b>Redmondville</b> are shown, the origin of the names is not given. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>McKenzie Settlement</b> was likely named after John and Roderick MacKenzie who were each granted 100 acres there in 1871 and 1873.<b><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span></b>(Could this have been the Roderick MacKenzie who married my Great<b> </b>Grandfathers sister, Annabelle MacDonald?<b><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span></b>John K. MacKenzie was granted lot #163 (100 acres) in 1907.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Would this have been Aunt Tine= second husband?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In 1909 Mary Anderson was granted 300 acres of land at the Little Branch end of the McKenzie Road</p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Point aux Carr</b> was once known as Cape Beduin; it is also known as Pointe au Quart.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Robert Logie came from Scotland around 1790 and the Black Brook Post Office was renamed <b>Loggieville</b> when Andrew Logie became Postmaster in 1895.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Miramichi </b>was<b> p</b>robably named by Cartier in 1535 from Montagnais <i>Maissimeu Assi</i><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>meaning Micmac Land. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><b>Northumberland Straight </b>appears to have been named by Admiral Colville<b> </b>around 1877 after his flagship, Northumberland.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Before that, it was known as<b> Red Sea</b>.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><b>Northumberland County</b> was established in 1785 and was probably named after Northumberland Strait.</p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Escuminac</b> comes from Micmac<b> </b><i>Eskumunaak</i> meaning "A lookout place."<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><b>Hardwicke Parish </b>was established in 1851 and named after Benjamin Hardwick of London who contributed to a Church of England Mission at Bay du Vin.<b><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span></b>He also contributed a communion service to the church.</p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><b>Glenelg Parish</b> was established in 1814 and was named by Major McDonald who settled in the area around 1790.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><b>Black River </b>was settled in 1820 by settlers from Scotland.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Before that it was known as Glenelg.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><b>Napan</b> is derived from the Micmac <i>Manabalnamajik</i><b> </b>which means Atake fish off stick.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Hexham</b> is also has Scottish roots.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Transportation</b><b></b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Transportation between settlements was mainly by boat hence the fact that initial settlements were along rivers and shores.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The dates on which grants were made also reflect the fact that, in the case of Black River, settlement proceeded up the river from its mouth. Adjacent lands along at Hexham and in Miramichi (Bayside) were granted in the 1780's and 1790's; settlers began to spread up the Black River, at least along the south side, after the turn of the century. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Initially blazed paths, and eventually roads were made between communities.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Elsewhere, I quoted my Great Grandmother=s sister, Maryanne Harley, about her walk from Pokemouche through the woods to Newcastle.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Helena (Smith) Kingston remembered her father, or was it her grandfather, traveling from Bayside to Loggieville by small boat to pick up supplies.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Later, commercial boats brought supplies from Loggieville dropping them off at various locations along the coast often taking fish on the return trip.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>According to the History of Bay du Vin, 25 pounds was appropriated in 1819 to develop a road from Black River to Bay du Vin.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In 1824, John Bailey Williston was given a sum of money to build to a width of 20 feet half the road from Bay du Vin to Black River.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The following was taken from the book by A. W. McDougall.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><i>Alexander MacDonald came from the Highlands with the 1803 immigration.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He settled on Lot #3 of the Third Division, on the west side of the southwest branch of Black River...</i></p>
<p><i></i><br></p>
<p><i>It has been told of the elder Mr. MacDonald, that when the Government Surveyors were allotting the land to the prospective settlers, he was told to proceed along the shore till he had secured a sufficient frontage for his lot, the surveying party following him downstream in a canoe.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Land being plentiful, Mr. MacDonald decided to secure as large a grant as possible.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>After he had gone a considerable distance, his further progress was barred by a creek, but he plunged in and waded across, only to be brought to a halt on the other side by the government men, who considered that he had already acquired sufficient.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>(Would this be Miller=s Brook?)</i></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Even when I was a youngster, I remember someone pointing out the A bark road which by then was only an overgrown road where it crossed our property but could be more clearly seen and perhaps even used where it crossed the McKinght Road.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The Bark Road was used in winter to haul bark from the Black River area to be used in both Chatham and Newcastle during the shipbuilding era.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is likely that started up the Mackenzie settlement, crossed woodland properties in the Branch and Black River, crossed the river, travelled along the A short cut towards Point Aux Carr then turned west, crossed the Napan road and eventually ended up at Chatham or Newcastle.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>The first Tasks</b><b></b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>On arrival, an immigrant would seek out a piece of land to make a home.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The land was heavily forested and the first task would be to make a clearing and prepare lodging for the coming winter, Homes were made of logs cut on the property by hand; crevices between the logs were stuffed with moss to keep out the cold and snow.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Logs not needed were used for firewood; burned and the first seeds, wheat, oats, potatoes and garden vegetables were planted and harvested among the stumps - again by hand.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A root cellar kept vegetables from freezing during the long winters.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Schools</b><b></b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Most of the early settlers in Black River spoke Gaelic.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Based on the work of A. W. McDougall, the first instruction in Black River was provided in a barn belonging to Archibald Cameron, Sr.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Following this, teachers provided instruction in their own homes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In 1825, residents petitioned for the erection of a school which was erected across the road from the Richard Godfrey residence (Until a few years ago, the residence of John Godfrey); this would be just east of the lane leading to St. Stephen=s church. This building seems to have served all of Black River and as far east as Bay du Vin.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>About 1845, the district was divided with one school being build at Middle Black River and another at Bayside (now Miramichi).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A few years later a school was erected at Little Branch; shortly thereafter, the school burned but was soon replaced.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I have no information on dates for the first school in Upper Black River but believe that the first school was east of Route 11.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>About 1037, the Rev. Douglas Smith, Rector at St. John’s Anglican Church in Bay du Vin provided tutoring in the Rectory to high school students in the area; numbers grew including students from Black River.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Teachers were hired and classes were moved to the church hall.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In January, 1940, the Miramichi Rural High School opened at Miramichi (Bayside) with 67 students enrolled.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Mills<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I do not know when the first saw mill was constructed at Little Branch, however, the History of Bay du Vin records a sawmill in Bay du Vin operated by Ortho Robichaud in 1789.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The Bay du Vin history also reports the following taken from the Gleaner in 1833.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><i>Mr. George Fowlie erected a gristmill on the Little Black River, which commenced grinding last week.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We have seen some bread made of the flour manufactured at this mill and it was of superior quality.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It has a never failing stream of water and will be a great accommodation to the inhabitants of Bay du Vin and adjoining settlements where such an establishment was much wanted.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The Fowlie mill was burned and rebuilt twice.</i></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Churches</b><b></b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>According to A. W. McDougall, most of the first settlers were Presbyterian and would have been served by an itinerant ministers and missionaries.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The first church, thought to be Presbyterian but used by all Protestants in the area, was built in Bay du Vin in 1812.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In 1818 the people of Bay du Vin, Burnt Church and Tabusintac petitioned for a minister to serve the three charges.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The people of Black River decided to build their own church and, on November 20, 1836, St. Stephens Presbyterian Church was officially opened.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The first building, I believe was erected between the present church and the cemetery.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>(Because this is a Glendenning family history, I should point out that for a short while, the minister was a Rev. A. Glendenning.)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The church became dilapidated and, rather than undertake repairs, a new building, the present St. Stephens Church (at that time Presbyterian) was opened on December 30, 1906.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>As a result of the creation of the United Church of Canada in 1925, members who wished to continue in the Presbyterian faith found themselves without a building.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>For a few years they met in members= homes or the school.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In 1930, St. Paul=s Presbyterian Church was officially opened; the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>St. Stephens continues to serve the community as St. Stephens United Church. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Post Office</b>s</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Canadian Archives has a database, searchable through the Internet, on post offices and postmasters.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>On checking the Little Branch Post Office, I found the following:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Postmaster		Dates				Cause of vacancy</b><b></b></p>
<p>Alexander Cameron	1871-11-01 to1876-03-30<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Resignation (Closed for 15 months)</p>
<p>John MacNaughton	1876-08-01 to 1883-08-20 Resignation, closed</p>
<p>Alexander Cameron	1884-11-01 to 1887-03-22 Resignation; closed for 6 months</p>
<p>George Fowlie	1887-09-01 to 1899-10-02	Death</p>
<p>Mrs. Marjorie Fowlie	1900-02-01 to 1903-09	 <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Change in site</p>
<p>Jubal Watling	1903-12-01 to 1910-12-02	Resignation</p>
<p>A.E. MacDonald	1911-03-01 to 1914-08-10	Resignation</p>
<p>Elmer Glendenning	1914-11-01 to 1916-08-01	Resignation</p>
<p>Donald MacNaughton	1916-09-01 to 1928-10-31	Closed</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Although Jubal Watling was the Postmaster, I believe that Aunt Tine MacKenzie ran the Post Office in the Jessie MacDonald house. (Where Norman Glendenning now lives)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This would be, as I understand it, between 1902 when her first husband, Tom Adams, died and 1907 when she married John MacKenzie.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The Post Office was closed for three months prior to Dad becoming Postmaster.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Watling Post Office</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>There was Post Office named Watling, which opened in 1911 and closed in 1928.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The Postmasters were Donald Watling, A. H. McKay and A. D. Watling.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This post office was on the north side of Black River between Middle and Upper Black River. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Land Grants on the Little Black River</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>My brother, Norman, lives at Little Branch on the property originally granted to Alexander MacDonald on June 3, 1812.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Based on my review of the Crown Land Grants Index and maps, the original grants along the Little Black River were as follows. All lots were granted on 1812-06-03 unless otherwise noted:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Lot 	1<span class="Apple-converted-space">      	</span>Enoch Godfrey			140 Acres</p>
<p>2<span class="Apple-converted-space">      	</span>Alexander McDonald Sr.	225 Acres<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>3. <span class="Apple-converted-space">    	</span>Kenneth Sinclair<span class="Apple-converted-space">            		</span>220 acres</p>
<p>4&amp;5 <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Angus Sinclair <span class="Apple-converted-space">          		</span>410 acres</p>
<p>6<span class="Apple-converted-space">      	</span>Alexander McDonald 		140 acres <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Further up was a lot of 300 Acres granted to George Fowlie in 1834-01-11.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>On the north side of the Little Black River starting at the mouth, we find:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>1	John, Catherine and Jean, children of Hugh MacLean	470 Acres</p>
<p>2	Farquhar McRaw						240 Acres</p>
<p>3	Kenneth MacDonald						440 Acres</p>
<p>4	Duncan MacNaughton					200 Acres</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Moving west from the Alexander McDonald property, we find:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>1,2 &amp; 3<span class="Apple-converted-space">  	</span>John McLean - 370 Acres</p>
<p>4 		Alexander Gunn - 230 Acres</p>
<p>5 		Robert MacBeath - 165 Acres</p>
<p>6		John MacLeod - 195 Acres</p>
<p>7		The front 100 Acres was granted to Thomas Patterson on 1908-12-31</p>
<p>The back 100 acres was granted to Elmer Gendenning on 1936-09-16</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>MACDONALD</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Alexander MacDonald reports was a native of the Parish of Assynt in Rosshire, Scotland.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Rosshire is on the northern part of the west coast of Scotland and includes many islands.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Alexander=s wife, Grace McAskill came from Sutherland County which adjoins Rosshire on the north.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That area is hilly and rocky with many inlets and streams and little land suitable for cultivation.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Another piece of information reports that Alexander and Grace came from the same parish. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Alexander MacDonald married Grace MacAskill (I believe a relative of the giant Mac Askill of Cape Breton) and was said to have actually come to the Miramichi by way of Cape Breton.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In fact, some suggest that they were married in Cape Breton.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Their children include:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Kenneth, 1805-1837</p>
<p>Annabel, 1806?</p>
<p>Hugh MacAskill; 1808? - Sept 15 1873</p>
<p>Anne, 1813-1896</p>
<p>Isabella married Roderick Mackenzie</p>
<p>Margaret, 1815-1907, married William Godfrey</p>
<p>John, 1817 - Abt 1900 married Elspeth Jardine</p>
<p>Mary, 1821-1885 married Frederick Robertson</p>
<p>Jessie, 1823-1912</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The original MacDonald home, I believe, was close to the river in the field just above where Norman Glendenning now lives.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There was an old apple orchard there as well as a depression in the ground.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Teddy Fowlie once said that his father, Bill Fowlie, remembered the old homestead in that location.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Lillian (Glendenning) Weeks remembered a pile of lumber in that area that she thinks was the remnants of the old home.</p>

<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The GLEANER and Northumberland, Kent, Gloucester and Restigouche Commercial and Agricultural Journal (p30) reports the following death in 1843:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><i>On the 31st of October, of dropsy, after an illness of eight months, which he here with truly Christian resignation to the divine will, Mr. Alexander MacDonald, of Little Branch, Black River, in the 68</i><i><sup>th</sup></i><i> year of his age, thus leaving a disconsolate wife, in the evening of her days, two sons and six daughters, to mourn the loss of an affectionate husband and tender father.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He calmly resigned his spirit into the hands of his Maker, in the firm hope of blessed immortality.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Blessed are they who die in the Lord.</i></p>

<p><i>Mr. MacDonald was a native of the Parish of Assynt, Rosshire, Scotland and immigrated to this country in the year 1803.</i></p>

<p><br></p>
<p>The Union Advocate, Newcastle, Miramichi, NB, A Weekly Journal Dedicated to Literature, Education, Politics, Agriculture, General Intelligence and Useful Information, reported the following death ion Wednesday, March 4, 1874:</p>

<p>The following information about the MacNaughtons was provided by Donald Edge, whose mother was a MacNaughton and a direct descendant of the early MacNaughtons.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>According to the 1851 census, Christina MacNaughton came to New Brunswick in 1812; she was joined by three brothers, Alexander, Donald and Malcolm in October, 1817 and Mary in November of the same year.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In 1919, the family was joined by their mother, Catherine and two other brothers, Duncan and John.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>They were granted land on the north side of the Black River A, Alexander being granted 296 acres and John Donald and Malcolm 200 acres each.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Duncan had been killed by a falling tree in 1824 and was the second person buried in the Black River Cemetery<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p>The Tri-Weekly (Chatham, NB) included the following item for September 28, 1934:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><i>Many friends in Little Branch and vicinity heard with regret of the death of Mrs. Jubal Watling, which occurred at her home yesterday afternoon.</i></p>
<p><i></i><br></p>
<p><i>The late Mrs. Watling was aged 86 years and before her marriage was Miss Grace MacDonald of Black River.</i><i></i></p>

<p><i>The funeral will be held on Saturday afternoon Service will commence at 2:30 o=clock and will be conducted by Rev. A. R. Gibson of Chatham.</i><i></i></p>

<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><i>MRS. JUBAL WATLING</i></p>

<p><i>The funeral of the late Mrs. Jubal Watling took place from her late residence Saturday afternoon and was largely attended.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The service was conducted by Rev.

<p><i></i><br></p>
<p><i>The floral offerings were many and beautiful.</i></p>
<p><i></i><br></p>
<p><i>The pallbearers were Norman MacKenzie, Walter Glendenning, Gordon MacNaughton, Alex Newton (grandson), Jubal Dickson and James Jardine.</i></p>
<p><i></i><br></p>
<p><i>Interment was made in St. Stephen=s cemetery.</i></p>
<p><i></i><br></p>
<p><i>Mrs. Watling was a lifelong Presbyterian, a sincere Christian, woman whose kingdom was her home and her children rise up to call her blessed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Her gentle kindly ways endeared her to all who knew her and she will be greatly missed in the community.</i></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>Among things which I remember are the following:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>George Loggie said that Alexander MacDonald spent the first winter in Point Aux Carr after coming from Cape Breton</p>
<p>Ernie MacLean said that the original Alexander MacDonald grant is the land now owned by Norman Glendenning and Neil Watling.</p>
<p>The original home was situated above Norman Glendenning=s barn near the old apple orchard.</p>
<p>Teddy Fowlie said, as I recall, that his father, when a boy on the way to school, would stop at a MacDonald’d home in the field above Norman=s to get warm.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This, I believe, was in the field where an old pump was (still is ?).</p>
<p>I believe that the Alexander MacDonald property was divided between his son, John, married to Elspeth Jardine, getting the east half and his daughter, Jessie, getting the West half. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>John’s half went to Jubal and Grace (MacDonald) Watling.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Jubal left his property to James A and Ernest Watling; James bought out Ernest’s share. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This information is based on hearsay not on research.</p>
<p>When<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Jessie died in 1912, her property appears to have gone to her nephew, Alexander MacDonald from whom Elmer Glendenning bought it in 1914.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Watling</b><b></b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Watling is a rare name so, when I saw reference to it at a genealogy shop last winger I stopped to take a look.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I also bought one of those family name scrolls. I=ve summarized it below.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Watling is likely originally a Viking name which came first to Norther Scotland, then to France and finally to England.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The first record of the name was found in Sussex and would be somewhere between London and Dover.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They were Lords of the Manor and may well have been there from the time of William the Conqueror (1066).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>While the origin is not known precisely, it is likely either that they came from the village of Wartlington or were in some way, connected with the great Roman Road, Watling Street, which starts in Sussex and continues into Northern England.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Watling is thought to share the same roots as Whatling, Watlington, Watlingtone, Whatlington, Whatlingtone, Wadling and Wadlington.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Over time, the name spread northward through England and into Scotland.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Thomas Watling was banished to Australia for forgery in 1792; Francis Watling settled in Virginia in 1660, John Watling landed in America in 1753 and Mary Watlington settled in Antigua in 1759.</p>

<p><b>Jardine</b><b></b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>In an earlier issue, I referred to some information in the Jardine family history which is at odds with what I have.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Thanks to information from a number of people, I am convinced that our Great-grandmother was Elspeth Jardine and not Elizabeth Jardine as reported in the Jardine history.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>As far as I can figure out, our Great-grandmother, Elspeth Jardine who married John MacDonald, was the daughter of James Jardine (son of Joseph and Janet (Kerr) Jardine of Tundergarth, Dumfriesshire, Scotland). Great-grandmother=s brothers and sisters included Margaret who married Thomas Lockerbie, Joseph who married Barbara Rust, Janet who married Francis McKnight, George who married Mary Cameron, and James.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The Jane Elizabeth Jardine, after whom my mother was named, was a first cousin of my Great-grandmother.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Her father was John, a brother of Frank.</p>
