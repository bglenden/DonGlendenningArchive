<div class="reader-summary">Don&#x27;s account of the family home in Little Branch, originally built in the mid-to-late 1800s for Miss Jessie (schoolteacher who died 1912). Elmer Glendenning purchased it in 1914 and significantly expanded it in 1919 to accommodate his growing family of nine children (four daughters, five sons). Details the major renovation including added ell, new kitchen, dining room, parlour, bedroom on first floor, and four upstairs bedrooms. Describes sourcing materials from their own property: spruce framing, maple floors, pine cupboards from Fowlie&#x27;s mill. Includes outbuildings: barn, henhouse, grain shed, privy, and seed shed for Agricultural Society #103.</div>

<p><b>HOME</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Miss Jessie’s home sao n a hill overlooking the Little Branch School, an appropriate location for a school teacher.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The home itself, in Miss Jessie’s day was a modest one and would have been quit appropriate for an unmarried school teacher in the late 1800s.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Miss Jessie died in 1912 at the age of 89, my father bought the home in 1914.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We do not know when it was built but probably in the mid to late 1800s.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>It was a typical small farm home of the period.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>One and one-half story with a pitched roof and a parlour just inside the front door.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The kitchen was likely attached with winding stairs to the second floor bedrooms.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>My father bought the property in 1914 and, with Mum and the three oldest children, live there for a period of two years; then they returned to the USA.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In 1919, the family, now six in all, returned permanently to Little Branch. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>– and more space was needed. He added an ell and remodeled the existing house and ended up with a large kitchen with a pantry<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>and back entry a dining room, parlour and a bedroom on the first floor.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There were four bedrooms on the second floor.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Under it all was a full basement with a large shute for putting wood in the basement and a verandah across the front.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Here they raised a family of four daughters and five sons.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Lumber for the addition and renovation was cut on the property, likely sawed at Fowlie’s mill, a mile further up the Little Branch River and included the spruce for framing, maple for the new floors and pine for the cupboards and trim.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The cedar shingles may have been cut on the property but most likely were purchased in Loggieville or Chatham. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Outbuildings included a traditional barn about 100 feet from the house to which my father had added a piece thereby doubling its size, a henhouse, a grain shed and an outdoor privy.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The “seed shed”, owned by Agricultural Society #103, was located across the lane and for a few weeks in the fall of 1939, the shanty from the ridge was located next to the seed shed to provide sleeping quarters for some of the family when<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>the remainder were quarantined – or at least to provide the appearance of sleeping quarters outside the home.</p>
