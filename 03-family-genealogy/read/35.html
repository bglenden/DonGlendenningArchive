<p><b>The Family</b> <b>Chronicle</b><b></b></p>
<p>No.35										 <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>February 28, 2003</p>
<p><span><span class="Apple-converted-space">                                                                                                                                 </span>________________</span><span><b>Follow-up</b></span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Donna (Russell) Goodfellow confirms that their flinch Game came from my sister, Grace.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I must now conclude that Flinch was a game unique to our family.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Parker Brothers still sells the game; I bought two games yesterday.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Dorothy (MacKay) Lind wondered about Ken’s Hill.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As one left the Little Branch School heading for Loggieville, one passed the Jim Finno property.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was a large two-story home in a long lane and near the river.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>From the turn to the brook was what we called the “Finno property.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Dad had bought it from Jim Finno many years ago.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Still traveling towards Loggieville, one climbed “Ken’s Hill”.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>On the right, towards the shore, stood the Ken MacDonald house.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Further along, still on the right hand side of the road, was a small bungalow built originally, I believe, by Weldon MacDonald.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Ken and Cameron MacDonald were Weldon’s sons.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As a matter of interest, Cameron retired back to Black River and built a home on the hill where the Ken MacDonald property once stood.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I’ve also heard the breakfast story.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>During a health class, the teacher was asking students what they had for breakfast.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Ken is reported to have said “Some mornings we have porridge and some mornings we have "slipgut”,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Slipgut was a term used for porridge made from home grown wheat ground into flour.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>(At one time there was a gristmill up the Branch but in my time, grain was taken to the “Monks” in Rogersville to be ground)</p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>The Ford truck</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>On Saturday, we finished work early and went in town; stores were open until nine.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>John usually picked up a number of people from around Black River and took them to town; he also brought them back home usually sometime after 10:00 or eleven o’clock.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The truck had a covered box and often there would be 10 or more people crowded into the back of the truck.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The last thing before leaving town was to drive up main street and past Ben’s to see if someone needed a drive home.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Most trips were uneventful, however, I recall the truck hitting a skunk one night at the foot of the hill by Doug Campbell’ s.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Another time on a Sunday morning, we found a pair of false teeth in the back of the truck.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>On another occasion, John drove Roy Watling and his date to Hardwicke after a dance and, on the way home, a calf jumped out in front of the truck and was killed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I woke to a commotion.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Seems to me that Uncle Jim came over and skinned and dressed the calf in the early morning hours.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There was some damage to the grill of the truck.</p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>My first Dance</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>One late afternoon about the second week of June 1946, Elinor and I were in the front yard, perhaps even raking the yard, when Harry MacLean walked by on the way home (from work?).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We spoke as he walked by and he asked me if I was going to the dance in the Black River Hall that night.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I went for the first time and had my first dance, a “Lancer”, with Norma Williston.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Norma and I were in the same Grade at the Branch School and later at the Miramichi Rural High School.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>That summer we often went to dances two or three times a week at the Black River Hall, at Mel Adams’ hall, Napan School and probably elsewhere.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>One night a fight erupted at the Black River Hall and spilled out into the yard emptying the hall.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Francis MacNaughton and I even went to dances in Sunny Corner.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Jim Finno</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Earlier I mentioned the Finno home by the river.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Jim Finno was blind.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I believe that he had a dog and stories were told about him having a shotgun.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He had a small apple orchard, which included a “transparent” apple tree.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Transparent were an early apple, a brilliant yellow (but not to be confused with the “Dutch Apples”) and sweet to the taste.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The Finno apples were reputed to be the best.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>One evening about dusk, a number of us decided to try some of his transparent apples.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We went to the wharf and then started up the hill towards the house walking near the riverbank.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When we were still about 150 feet from the house, Mr. Finno came out on the porch.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We did not wait but scrambled over the steep bank.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I forget about the others but recall that I ended up with a sprained ankle.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Plane Crashes</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>The Miramichi was a hive of activity during the war.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The airport housed both No 10 Air Observer School using Anson’s and No. 31 Elementary Flying Training School using a bi-wing plane – a Fleet Canuck it was called.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>All were painted bright yellow presumably so they could be spotted easily if they crashed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The Miramichi area was designated a low-flying area so low flying planes were common.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Stories were told about a plane flying under the Newcastle Bridge.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It seems to me that a plane caught the radio aerial at Add Fowlie’s.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A plane came down once in Harper’s field because of engine trouble; it seems to me that one may have landed one time on the ice near Victoria Bridge.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>One small plane crashed in Hexham in Herb MacDonald’s lane.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was a snowy day, probably November of 1941 although it could have been in 1940.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>No one was hurt.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>On the way home that evening, the school bus stopped at the end of the lane and we walked in to see the plane which was standing on its nose.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Later, another plane crashed this time in the summer.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I would guess in September because the grain had not been cut.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Mum and I were on the porch cleaning eggs when we heard a plane go over and suddenly went quiet.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Apparently the plane was following the Little Branch River from Fowlie’s Mill toward the mouth when the left wing struck a tree.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The plane crashed at Alf MacLean’s shore.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Harry MacLean was first on the scene; I got on my bike and was there soon after.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Again, the plane was on its nose at the bank.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>One many was killed – a man by the name of Neely, as I recall.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Often when a plane would be down and its whereabouts not known, we would sit in the dark at a window for hours at night in case we could see a flare.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We never did.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Model Planes</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Building model planes was a hobby of wartime.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I built three.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The first, and my most successful one was a Spitfire.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It probably was 12 – 15 inches in length, was made of balsa wood glued together with “banana oil” and covered with a thin paper.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Mine was powered by a rubber band, (didn’t know that small engines existed or couldn’t afford one if I did) which was attached to the propeller and threaded through the fuselage and fastened at the back of the plane.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The rubber band was twisted by turning the propeller.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When the propeller was released, the Spitfire would lift off the floor unaided in the length of the kitchen.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I cannot remember my second plane but the last was much larger, either a Norseman or a Lysander – the wings were at the top of the fuselage and it had both floats and wheels</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>The School Stove</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>Each year someone was contracted to start put on a fire at the Little Branch School so that the school would be warm when the rest of the students and the teacher arrived.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I did it one year, I think the winter of 1940-41 but I am not sure.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Nor do I remember how much I was paid.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Each morning I would go down to the school by or shortly after 7:30 and start the fire.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>During the day, anyone could be asked to fill the stove.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>A Cautionary Lantern</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Another time, probably when I was in High School, the Branch Bridge was under repair.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There were several piles of bridging material piled on the side of the road on the north side of the bridge.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Mr. Fred A. Fowlie was the man in charge and I received 35 cents per night to hang a lantern, or perhaps two, to alert people to the construction.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Each evening just before dark I would fill the lantern with oil, clean the globe and carry it to the site.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In the morning, before going to school, I brought the lantern home.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Seems to me that I got a cheque at the end of the job for $25 - $30 dollars.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Of course, oil lamps and lanterns were our only source of light.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We had three oil lamps and at lasts two lanterns.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Each morning, Mum cleaned the lamp globes and filled them with oil then placed them on a high shelf in the kitchen near the foot of the back stairs.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Lanterns also needed oil and cleaning and were hung in the back entry.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If they weren’t properly trimmed and cleaned, sometimes you had to light a second lantern to find the first one.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Later, I recall we got an Aladdin lamp – one with a mantle that gave off a very white light.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It used gas, naphtha perhaps, rather than kerosene.</p>
