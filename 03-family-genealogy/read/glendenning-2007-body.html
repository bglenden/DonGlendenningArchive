<h1 align="center"><b>INTRODUCTION</b></h1>
<p align="center"><br />

</p>
<p><br />

</p>
<p><br />

</p>
<p>My father and mother came from large and close
families; visits and visitors were frequent and family ties were
strong, even if remote.  At an early age, I became intrigued by the
number of neighbours along the length of the Black River to whom I
was related.  By the late 1940’s I began gathering family
information.  
</p>
<p><br />

</p>
<p align="justify">Information
was drawn from many sources with the Glendenning Family Bible in my
Mother’s possession as my point of entry.  Shortly thereafter, I
conducted a survey on my father’s side of the family and I was
hooked, although my information gathering was sporadic, at best.  The
benefit of computer based technology and a new spurt of information
gathering after retirement resulted in a cabinet full of files,
scraps of paper on every flat surface in my basement and a database
containing over 4,000 names.  The conclusion reached as a youngster
in Black River has been borne out; at that time I was related to most
people in the community.</p>
<p align="justify"><br />

</p>
<p align="justify">My
focus has been broad rather than narrow.  By that, I mean, I am
interested in the broad picture of who I am rather than pursuing only
my Glendenning roots.  As a result, I have since learned that, in
addition to my Glendenning ancestry, I am also a descendant of folks
named Peters, Sealey, Harley, Bidders, Rae, MacDonald, Watling,
MacAskill, MacNaughton, Leach and Jardine.  And if I were to reach
back further, I would find other ancestors as well.  
</p>
<p align="justify"><br />

</p>
<p align="justify">This
document does not pretend to be a history of the family; instead, it
is a record of what I learned during my search; a history would be
more thorough and complete.  If a lead interested me, I followed it. 
As a result the amount of information on each individual or family
varies greatly.  
</p>
<p align="justify"><br />

</p>
<p align="justify">I
believe the included information to be accurate but I am sure that
there are mistakes; if I knew what the mistakes were, I would have
corrected them.  When in doubt, I prefaced my remarks with “I
think” or “it is likely” or a similar statement.  I welcome
corrections and additions.  One of my weaknesses is in editing;
therefore, the reader is likely to find many inconsistencies - but
hopefully few errors.  Together we can continue to grow the record of
our mutual ancestors.  Unfortunately, it is only with recent
information that I have been attributing sources.  
</p>
<p align="justify">  
</p>
<p align="justify">Among
other things, I’ve reviewed books, searched through newspapers,
undertaken an occasional Internet search, gathered census data and
reviewed church and cemetery documents.   I’ve also spent hours
pestering family and friends and steering conversations to reveal
additional information.  Most of the photos came from my mother’s
collection.  
</p>
<p align="justify"><br />

</p>
<p align="justify"><br />

</p>
<p align="justify"><br />

</p>
<p align="justify"><br />

</p>
<p align="justify"><br />

</p>
<p align="justify"><br />

</p>
<p align="justify">Some
of the information in this document has already appeared in versions
distributed to siblings.  Other information appeared in occasional
newsletters, the <u>Family
Chronicle</u>, now
available, thanks to my son, Brian, and Granddaughter, Lisa, on the
Glendenning Website <u><a href="http://www.glendenning.net/don">www.glendenning.net/don</a></u>
 
</p>
<p align="justify"><br />

</p>
<p align="justify">In
the early stages of information gathering, I developed both a Watling
and a Glendenning chart, each 10 to fifteen feet long; these charts
certainly provided a tremendous insight into the family relationships
in the community of Black River.</p>
<p align="justify"><br />

</p>
<p align="justify">The
task is not complete; it will never be finished.  It is time,
however, to consolidate that which I have learned and publish it for
the benefit of others. It is my hope that readers will find the
document of interest but, even more important, I hope that others
will pick the search and extend the knowledge of both the extended
family and the community.  I also want to pursue some other
interests.  Having said that, however, I plan to continue to
integrate new bits of in formation as I find them. 
</p>
<p align="justify"><br />

</p>
<p>I want to thank all who contributed either
knowingly or unknowingly to this document.  My Mother and  the old
family Bible were the first sources but all my siblings contributed
along the way.  Family historians, many of whom are relatives, were
most generous with time and information.  As were friends and folks I
have never even met.  Thanks to all.</p>
<p align="justify"><br />

</p>
<p align="justify">Finally,
I must point out that this document entailed a considerable
commitment of time that really should have been allotted to my wife
and family.  Special thanks to Carol but also to Brian and Janet,
Marie, Lisa and Laura.</p>

<h1 align="center"><b>BACKGROUND</b></h1>
<p><br />

</p>
<p align="justify"><br />

</p>
<p align="justify"><br />

</p>
<p align="justify"><b>Introduction</b></p>
<p align="justify"><br />

</p>
<p align="justify">While
we usually carry the name of the male side of our ancestral family,
in fact, each person is equally a descendant of many other families
as well.  In the writer’s case, he is directly descended on his
paternal side from families named Glendenning, Beattie, Rae, Bidders,
 Harley, Sealey and Peters.  On the Watling side, the writer is
directly descended from families named Watling, Leech, MacNaughton,
MacDonald, McAskill and Jardine.  These families reflect Highland and
Lowland Scots, English and Irish roots; I recall a glendenning from
Utah who visited us in 1947 saying that the Glendennings were
descended from Robert the Bruce.  Both sides are also thought to
include Viking and Norman blood as well.  Of my Great Grandparents,
four were Scots, one was English and three were Irish, however, the
Irish ancestors may well have been emigrants from England a
generation earlier.  
</p>
<p align="justify"><br />

</p>
<p align="justify">The surge of Scottish settlers to
Canada in the late 1700’s may be attributed to a number of events. 
First was the Scottish Rebellion followed by an outlawing of the clan
system by an Act of Parliament in 1745.  Scots were required to take
an oath not to carry weapons and never use Highland garb.  Also in
the late 1700’s there was a great increase in the price of wool and
mutton which resulted in tenant farmers being turfed from the land
and cattle farms being replaced by large sheep farms.  
</p>
<p align="justify"><br />

</p>
<p align="justify">People
left their homes to come to Canada for many reasons including:</p>
<p align="justify"><br />

</p>
<ul>
	<li><p align="justify">escape
	from political unrest, religious strife and war</p></li>
	<li><p align="justify">getting
	away from poverty and crowded slums</p></li>
	<li><p align="justify">breaking
	with the rigid social class structure</p></li>
	<li><p align="justify">to
	start a new adventure and a new life</p></li>
	<li><p align="justify">an
	alternative to serving time in prison</p></li>
	<li><p align="justify">being
	forced out as tenant farmers</p></li>
	<li><p align="justify">religious
	persecution</p></li>
	<li><p align="justify">to
	become masters of their own fate</p></li>
	<li><p align="justify">see
	for themselves the land where trees yielded sugar, soap and fuel</p></li>
	<li><p align="justify">to
	take up land offered at the close of military service.</p></li>
</ul>
<p align="justify"><br />

</p>
<p align="justify">Immigrants
were often at the mercy of promoters, profiteers and land
speculators.  The journey by sea was long, overcrowded and difficult;
many people did not reach the new land.  On Grosse Isle, at the mouth
of the Saint Lawrence River, over five thousand people who endured
the passage, lie buried. 
</p>
<p align="justify">As
of the time of writing, I do not know where any of my ancestors first
set foot on solid ground in the new land.  It is likely, however,
that it was Cape Breton, Pictou, Halifax, Saint John or the
Miramichi.  The exception to our not knowing is my great
grandmother’s sister, 
</p>
<p align="justify"><br />

</p>
<p align="justify">Mary
Ann Harley, who first set foot in Canada at Pokemouche on the Baie de
Chaleur near Bathurst, New Brunswick.  On her 99<sup>th</sup>
birthday, birthday, she was interviewed by a newspaper in Portland,
Maine where she was living. A reprint of that story may be found in
the next section of this document.</p>
<p align="justify"><br />

</p>
<p align="justify">On
landing most anywhere in Eastern Canada, settlers found a land
covered with forests where wild life roamed in abundance; the air was
fresh and land, sea and air provided fresh food.  Their first task
was to clear the land and erect shelter for the looming winter - log
houses to stem the cold the likes of which they had not experienced
before.  
</p>
<p align="justify"><br />

</p>
<p align="justify"><b>Origin
of Names</b></p>
<p align="justify"><br />

</p>
<p align="justify">Until
about 1000 A.D. most people in Europe had only one name. Later, to
distinguish one person from another, a second name was added. The
second name was usually taken from the person's occupation, location,
father's name, or some characteristic.</p>
<p align="justify"><br />

</p>
<p align="justify"><b>Coats
of Arms</b></p>
<p align="justify"><br />

</p>
<p align="justify">Knights
in battle wore a suit of armour for protection, however, in the heat
of battle it was easy to mistake friend for foe. In order to provide
a means of quick identification, knights began painting designs on
their suits of armour. These designs were also woven into light coats
and worn over the armour. Thus originated the term &quot;coat of
arms&quot;. 
</p>
<p align="justify"><br />

</p>
<div id="Section3" dir="ltr"><p align="justify">Many
	early coats of arms had neither crest nor motto; these were later
	additions. The crest worn above the shield and helmet, was usually
	used in tournaments but not every knight was eligible to
	participate. The motto is believed to have originated as a battle
	cry in the seventeenth century.</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">There
	is really no such thing as a family coat of arms. Coats of arm
	belong to the chief and are passed down by him through his eldest
	son. A descendent may, however, apply to the Court of the Lord Lyon
	of Scotland to have a coat of arms established and registered. A
	personal coat of arms is usually some variation of that of the
	ancestral coat of arms.</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify"><b>Clans</b></p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">Scottish
	clans are a form of tribal system, which began to take shape in 843
	when the Picts and Scots united.  <i>Clann</i>
	is Gaelic for children and works like an extrended family with a
	chief as head.  The Chief was responsible for protecting the clan
	from its enemies, for settling disputes, and for leading the clan in
	battle.  A clan would often offer protection to a smaller groups
	known as septs.  The Glendennings were a sept of the Douglas clan.</p>
	<p align="justify"><b>Tartans</b></p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">Tartans
	appear at first to be patterns of cloth found in a community and
	reflected the local colours and skills of local weavers.  They were
	associated with the area where one lived rather than the clan to
	which one belonged.  This began to change, however, in the 18<sup>th</sup>
	century when tartans were adopted by various clans regardless of
	where clan members lived.</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<h2 align="justify">Blazon of Arms</h2>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">A written description of a coat
	of arms, called a blazon of arms, was prepared in a mixture of
	Ancient English, Latin and French when a coat of arms was granted. 
	The actual design, of graphics, was prepared from the blazon so it
	is not surprising that there are differences as interpreted by
	different artists.</p>

	<p><b>THE BATHURST CONNECTION</b></p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>The Canadian roots of my paternal ancestors are
	in an area north east of Bathurst, more precisely, the inland
	community of Canobie.  Travelling east from Bathurst along the coast
	towards Caraquet, one finds a number of communities familiar to the
	Glendenning family.  Most relevant are the following as described in
	the Geographical Names of New Brunswick, 1875:</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<ul>
		<li><p><b>Bathurst</b>,
		originally named St. Peters in 1671, was named for the Third Earl
		of Bathurst in 1826. 
		</p></li>
	</ul>
	<p style="margin-left: 0.44in; text-indent: -0.5in">
	<b>	</b></p>
	<ul>
		<li><p><b>Salmon
		Beach</b>
		was settled around 1820 by immigrants from Ireland and included the
		districts of Prospect Hill, Strawberry Plain and Mount Pleasant.  
		</p></li>
	</ul>
	<p style="margin-left: 0.94in; text-indent: -0.5in"><br />

	</p>
	<ul>
		<li><p><b>Janeville</b>
		was named for Jane Dawson, wife of Benjamin Dawson, who settled
		there about 1835.  
		</p></li>
	</ul>
	<p style="margin-left: 0.75in"><br />

	</p>
	<ul>
		<li><p><b>Stonehaven</b>
		was probably named for Stonehaven, Scotland. <b>
		</b>
		</p></li>
	</ul>
	<p style="margin-left: -0.06in; text-indent: 0.5in"><br />

	</p>
	<ul>
		<li><p><b>New
		Bandon</b>
		was settled in 1819 by several families from Bandon, Ireland.</p></li>
	</ul>
	<p style="margin-left: -0.06in"><br />

	</p>
	<ul>
		<li><p><b>Canobie</b>
		named  after Canonbie, Dumfriesshire, Scotland.  <b>	</b></p></li>
	</ul>
	<p style="margin-left: -0.06in"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="margin-left: -0.06in"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="margin-left: -0.06in">According
	to  Pioneer Settlers of the Bay Chaleur, settlement on the coast
	east of Bathurst took place by the Acadians in the latter half of
	the 1700s and, although living on the land, they were not given
	their grants until 1812.  Apparently, an organized system of
	granting of land did not evolve until the 1800s and even then there
	could be delays of a decade or more between petitioning land and
	receiving land.  Even then, a grant was not final until at least
	five acres had been cleared.  The first registered land grants in
	the area were made to James Sutherland and his brother Hugh, and to
	Richard Nevison in 1789.</p>
	<p style="margin-left: -0.06in"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="margin-left: -0.06in">Once
	settled, men began the task of clearing land and erecting a house
	and barn.  Trees not needed were stacked, dried and burned.  Few
	oxen or horses were available so the land was broken and cultivated
	with the aid of a hoe.  The initial crops were planted between the
	stumps, which, over time, rotted and were removed.  In many cases,
	the initial seeds were often carried by settlers from the old
	country.</p>
	<p style="margin-left: -0.06in"><br />

	</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>While
	I do not know the precise point where my ancestors set foot in the
	new world, we do know that many immigrants first set foot in Canada
	in such ports as Saint John and Halifax; some likely trans-shipped
	to smaller ports.  On the other hand, some came directly to the
	Miramichi, Bathurst, Pokeshaw, Bass River and Caraquet.  The Bay
	Chaleur history records that Pokeshaw had a secure harbour and was
	an active fishing centre.  As early as 1812, 30 acres of land had
	been cleared and a number of houses had constructed.  Sailing
	vessels stopped there for water and supplies including fresh meat.  
	</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>The
	exception to our not knowing is the account given by my Great
	Grandmother’s sister, Mary Ann Harley, who first set foot in
	Canada at Pokemouche on the Baie de Chaleur near Bathurst, New
	Brunswick.  Mary Ann was born in Courtmacsherry, Ireland on 6
	February, 1799.  On her 99<sup>th</sup>
	birthday, she was interviewed by a newspaper in Portland, Maine
	where she was living. I am grateful to Willis Hamilton for a copy of
	an article appearing in a Portland paper at that time.   
	</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p style="margin-left: 0.5in">“<i><b>I
	was born in Courtmasherry, Ireland, February 6, 1799.  This is a
	small town only a little distance from the city of Cork, near the
	Bay of Cork.  My maiden name was Mary Ann Harley, and my father was
	a schoolteacher in the town.  I had two brothers and three sisters. 
	All dead now.  One of my sisters lived to be 94, died on her
	birthday.  I can remember the town where we lived very well, and the
	names of friends and schoolmates.  I left Ireland in 1822.  I can
	remember about my father and mother talking about the rising of ‘98;
	people never seemed to get tired of taking about that event.  My
	father was of English descent, a Presbyterian and I was raised in
	the church.</b></i></p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><i><b>Very
	well can I remember the day on which two big ships of war sailed
	into Cork harbor, their decks crowded with men and their masts with
	gay flags.  These ships were bringing us the first news of the
	battle of Waterloo in which that terror of the world and ogre of
	history, Napoleon Bonaparte was defeated by our own Duke of
	Wellington.  People went crazy with joy; the bells of the city of
	Cork were rung, and great bonfires were lit in celebration of the
	great event.  Three of the officers of an Irish regiment were
	quartered at my father’s house for many days, and I remember some
	of the stories they had to tell of that terrible fight.  Their
	bright uniforms and handsome faces made a great impression on me.</b></i></p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><i><b>In
	1822 I went to visit a lady friend in Queenstown, and while I was
	there the first steamboat ever to come into Irish waters came into
	the harbor.  Everyone turned out and lined the docks to the strange
	craft which moved so swiftly through the waters without sail or
	oars.  It was a wonderful thing then, but I suppose the people of
	Queenstown see enough such craft now.  While I was in Queenstown I
	got a letter from my brother William in America.  He was a
	government surveyor, and he wanted me to come over as soon as
	possible as he said he had a young, handsome and wealthy husband
	waiting for me.  I went home to my parents and it was decided that I
	would sail for America.</b></i></p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><i><b>I
	was one of 150 passengers on a sailing ship which left Cork on May
	7, 1822.  It was a terrible voyage.  I was sick almost all the way,
	and glad to see land after seven weeks and three days aboard that
	ship.  I landed at a place called Pockshaw on the Bay of Chaleur. 
	It was a very small settlement then, only a few small houses made of
	logs.  My brother was there waiting for me.  We had to walk 75 miles
	through the woods to get to his home.  No roads, no conveyances of
	any kind, not even a path.  It was a trackless forest in which not
	one tree had been cut.  We made our way by means of compass over
	windfalls and across brooks to Newcastle.  We were three nights on
	the road and we had to sleep in the woods without any shelter.  </b></i>
	</p>
	<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><i><b>On
	the fourth night we got to Newcastle, a very small settlement. 
	Eight months after my arrival at this place I married John Henry; he
	was a man of business and agent for a large mercantile firm.  I had
	nine children and seven grew up and married.  I don’t know how
	many descendents I have, but they must number in the hundreds.  My
	husband died 28 years ago (1870) I lived on the Miramichi until
	after my husband's death, then I came to the States where some of my
	children lived.  I had a brother named John Harley who built ships

<p align="justify">My Great-great-grandmother, Mary Rae, married John
Glendinning in Scotland.  Rae, Rea and Ree are old surnames in
Dumfriesshire and are probably of local origin.  They appear to have
been a troublesome lot and were frequently in court.  According to
Black’s Surnames of Scotland, the earliest mention of the name is
around 1231 when Robert Raa a mason, witnessed a charter to the Abbey
of Culross. Thomas Ra was a witness about 1290, Robert Ra was burgess
of Stirling in 1296-1300, William Raa had a pension in 1329, Robert
Raa was a juror at an inquest in Roxburgh in 1380, William Raa was
Bishop of Glasgow and there are other instances of the name Raa.  The
name also appeared in Perth in 1546.  Rae is a Sept of the MacRae
clan.  MacRae means son of Rae.</p>

<p align="justify">My
Great Grandmother, Margaret (Harley) Glendinning was the daughter of
William Harley and Anne Bidders.  I know not their origin but it was
likely in England and they migrated later to Ireland.</p>

<p align="justify"><b>C	HARLEY</b></p>

</p>
<p align="justify">My
great- grandmother was Margaret Harley.  Much of my information comes
from secondary sources - family lore and Pioneer Settlers of the Bay
Chaleur which was published in 1978. It is also based on entries in
the old family Bible, inscriptions on headstone, information provided
by Willis Hamilton and later contact with Harley descendants. 
</p>
<p align="justify"><br />

</p>
<p align="justify">Harley
is a well-known English name in Ireland.  According to my sources,
the name is also found in Scotland but is considered in Scotland as a
late-comer from England.  The name is recorded as early as 1228. 
Harle, Harles, Harrily and Hurley, the latter in Cork County,
Ireland.<b>
</b>One
source suggests that Harley is derived from Hareswood - the name of
places in both Shropshire and Yorkshire, England.  According to
Black’s Surnames of Scotland, Johannes de Herl witnessed a charter
in the Abbey of Kelso around 1228. De Herl is thought to have come
from Kirkharle in Northumberland which is the name of a property in
Northumberland County.<b>
 </b>An
earlier version, Harrily, appears to have disappeared.</p>

<p align="justify">My
Great-grandmother lived with her parents and siblings in
Courtmacsherry, a small town near Cork, County Cork,  Ireland.  Her
father, William, was of English descent and was a school teacher in
Courtmacsherry.  He was Presbyterian and, apparently, quite active in
the church. At least one of the children, Mary Ann, was born in
Courtmacsherry and refers to herself as having been raised in the
church.  The chances are that the other four children were born and
lived in Courtmacsherry as well.  Five Harley siblings came to New
Brunswick:

Great-grandmother was Jane Sealy married to John Peters.  Sealy is of
Norman extraction and settled originally in Somerset and Devon
counties in England.  Other forms of the name include Seeley, Seely,
and Seelye.  The name is thought to mean &quot;a happy or prosperous
person, the good, simple man.&quot;  John Sealy moved to from England
to Ireland around during the reign of Charles the Second. Reference
is made to John’s son Robert of Bandon.  Other Sealys include

</p>
<p align="justify">My
grandmother, Elizabeth Peters, married Walter Glendenning.  Settlers
of the Bay of Chaleur says that the Peters came from Ireland,
however, my search shows Peters, meaning “Peter, a rock”, and is
not uncommon in the  Angus, Kincardine and Aberdeen areas of
Scotland.   The name John Peter is found in 1636, Andro Peter in
Kirkcaldie in 1840, David Peter in Peebles, southern Scotland, in
1645 and Alexander Peter in Melrose in 1648.  The name is also found
in southern Scotland which is closer to Dumfrieshsire.  Peters,
Pieter, Peterson and probably Petrie have the same roots.  My
references show Peters as a Sept of both the MacGregor and MacLaren
clans.</p>
<p align="justify"><br />

</p>
<p align="justify">The
name Petrie was found in Balwelow in 1513, Andrew Petrie was Vicar of
Wick Caithness in 1530 and there are a number of later references.</p>

</p>

<p><br />

</p>
<p>For
fifty years, the above was all we knew about my Grandfather’s

is related to the Glendennings of Harcourt, New Brunswick. Ian
pointed me to the Death Records of Langholm, Dumfries, Scotland from

<p><b>Dumfriesshire</b></p>
<p><br />

</p>
<p>Dumfriesshire,
in southern Scotland, is considered the home of the
Glendinnings/Glendennings with the first record of the family being a
deed granting territories of all the baronies of Clifton and Merbotel
in Roxburghshire to Adam de Glendonwyn in 1286.</p>
<p><br />

</p>
<p>Dumfriesshire
and Roxburghshire are actually adjacent to each other in southern
Scotland near the border with England. The area was subject to many
changes as a result of invasions by Celts, Irish Gaels, Angles,
Picts, and Vikings. By the year 1000, discernable clans and families
began to emerge. This area figured prominently in the many border
disputes between England and Scotland.</p>
<p><br />

</p>
<p>My Great Grandfather, John Glendinning, was born
in Callister Hall in Dumfriesshire, Scotland in 1807.  He came to New
Brunswick in 1830.  <u>Bartholomew’s Gazetteer of the British
Isles, 1887</u>, described Dumfriesshire as follows:</p>
<p><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><i>DUMFRIESSHIRE,
maritime co., on S. border of Scotland; </i>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><i>adjoins
the cos. Of Lanark, Peebles and Selkirk on the N., and on the South
is washed by the Solway Firth; extends about 53miles NW. and SE,
between Ayrshire and Cumberland, and about 32 miles NE. and SW.
between Roxburghshire and Kircudbrightshire; a coast-line about 20
miles; area, 680,217 ac., pop. 76,140 or 72 persons to each sq. mile.
 The surface generally is bare and hilly.  The dales of the Nith,
Annan, and Esk, however, are rich in beauty, and contain fine holms
for pasture and some good arable land.  The rivers are numerous, and
yield splendid salmon and trout fishing.  The coast and S. region is
low and sandy; much of it is covered with morass, and lochs are
numerous around Lockerbie; but there is also much good corn-growing
land.  The Lowther or Lead Hills along the N. boundary are upwards of
2000 ft. in height, and abound in lead ore.  These and other hills
round the borders are mostly smooth in outline, and afford excellent
pasturage.  Red sandstone is a prevailing rock, and limestone, coal,
and lead are worked.”</i></p>
<p><br />

</p>
<p><br />

</p>
<p><br />

</p>
<p><b>Annan</b></p>
<p><br />

</p>
<p>Because
John Glendinning sailed from Annan, my early view was that Annan was
significant component in my search.  I now realize, however, it was
simply the seaport from which John Glendinning sailed.  Nevertheless,
having gathered the information, I include it here for the reader’s
information.  
</p>
<p><br />

</p>
<p>Annan
was founded by Robert the Bruce and developed at a major crossing of
the Annan River.  Annan was often fought over during the times of
Anglo-Scottish conflict.  Between 1298, when it was first destroyed
until after 1660, it was a frequent site of battles.  Erosion took
away part of the early castle and silting later left the town too far
inland for navigation.  Annan, it seems, became a major embarkation
point for Scottish settlers.  People gave their departure point as
Annan even though their homes may have bee far from there.</p>
<p><br />

</p>
<p>The
reference to Robert the Bruce is interesting also because, in the
late 1940’s, a member of the Mormon  Church visited Black river
and, among other things, said that the Glendennings were related to
Robert the Bruce.</p>
<p><br />

</p>
<p>In
1956 I contacted City Hall in Annan and told of my family connection.
 My letter was passed to James Glendinning who owned and operated a
men’s clothing store.  Later I visited Annan and stayed, as I
recall, two nights with James maiden aunts.  Next day, James took me
on a tour of the countryside but I do not remember visiting Callister
Hall where my Great Grandfather, John, was born.  James has since
died and the store is operated by his son, Walter, who I met on a
return visit to Annan.  (www.glen hire.demon.co.uk)

<p><b>Glendinning
Hamlet</b></p>
<p><br />

</p>
<p><br />

</p>
<p>In
the mid to late 1800s (and likely much earlier) the name Glendinning
Hamlet was included in maps of Scotland.  It  was a small hamlet
located some 25 to 30 miles north of Annan. It was known in the late
1700s for its antimony mining. In the mid 1800s the ruins of a castle
could still be seen there.  My search so far has not turned up any
direct connection between my ancestors and Glendinning Hamlet
although it is likely that such a connection exists.</p>

	</p>
	<p><b>Origin
	of Name Glendenning</b></p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>The
	name Glendinning is believed to be locational in nature and probably
	means &quot;one who came from the hidden dale&quot;. Glen is a
	common prefix and signifies a narrow valley bounding a river or
	stream. The name has been, and still is, spelled in a variety of
	ways but can be linked to Glendinning, Glendining, Glendennings,
	Glendowyne, Glenndinnin, Glendynwynnng, Glendinnin, Glendouwyne,
	Glendounn, and Glendoning. The two most frequent spellings are
	Glendinning and Glendenning.  The name Glendwnwyne first appears in
	1384 in the Parish of Westerkirk, Dumfries.</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>Another
	source suggests that the name originated in Wales and belonged to
	the Glendowers which was the Royal Family of Wales.  Many Welsh
	moved to the Border area of Scotland which is where the Glendinnings
	are found.  In 1263 at the Battle of Largs, Robert de Glendonwyn
	distinguished himself and was rewarded by the Scotch king with a
	grant of large estates in Ayr.   The name Glendenning was known in
	Scotland before this as the name of a large tract of land owned by
	the Douglas family.</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>While
	browsing the internet (2002/03/28) I found a reference to
	Glendonwyne originating from <i>“Glyn”
	</i>meaning
	valley<i>,
	“</i>din”
	being a fort and <i>“gwyn”
	</i>meaning
	fair or white.  This could be interpreted as fair skinned people
	from the fort in the valley.</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p><b>Glendinning
	or Glendenning</b></p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>It
	is not clear when or why the name Glendinning changed to
	Glendenning. The original entries in the family Bible, as noted
	earlier, are Glendinning. The name appearing on the gravestones for
	Walter and John, the next generation, is Glendenning.  The early
	land petitions were Glendinning while the later ones were
	Glendenning.  The change is most likely due simply to poor
	handwriting.

	<p><b>Clan
	Connection</b></p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>The
	Glendennings became closely associated with the Douglas clan and
	rented land in 1408 from Archibald, Lord of Galloway who was a
	Douglas. In fact the Glendennings are usually referred to as a
	&quot;sept&quot; of the Douglas clan rather than being a clan in
	their own right. Matthew of Glendonwyn became Bishop of Glasgow in
	1408. William Glendonwyn was Rector at Crawfordian. Simon, chief of
	the Clan, acted as a go-between in arranging a truce between England
	and Scotland in 1451. In 1548 the Glendennings were condemned by the
	Scottish Parliament as one of the &quot;unruly clans&quot;. John
	Glendinning was outlawed in 1667 and his lands and titles were
	forfeited.</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>But
	there also appears to be a connection to the Elliot/Eliot Clan. 
	Certainly they are from the same geographic area but the kinship
	awaits further exploration.</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p><b>Other
	Glendennings</b></p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>New
	Brunswick and Nova Scotia have a number of Glendennings and
	Clendennings who come from Dumfriesshire but a connection has not
	yet been found - at least by me.</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>There
	are Glendennings in Ontario, some of whom came into Canada as United
	Empire Loyalist.  Again, I have not been able to trace a connection.</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>Many
	Glendennings and Clendennings settled in the Eastern half of the
	United States. In fact, Charleston West Virginia was named for
	Charles Clendenning.  Again, I have found no connection to our
	family.  The <u>Synoptical
	Family History Giving Sketches of the Glendonyn- Glendening-
	Clendening- Etc. Family.</u>
	provides extensive documentation about the Glendennings in the USA. 
	The information in it confirms what I have found and adds some
	detail.  In my review, other than general information about our
	roots in the Border country, no precise matches were found, however,
	the following paragraph proved interesting:

	</p>
	<p>John
	Glendinning, my Great-Grandfather, was born on April 2, 1807, at
	Callister Hall, Parish of Middlebie, Dumfriesshire, Scotland and was
	baptized on July 10, 1808</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>In
	1830, he sailed from Annan, a seaport on Dumfriesshire on the south
	coast of Scotland.  This would be the nearest port to where he was
	born. It is likely, although we have no record, that he landed at
	Pokeshaw on the Bay Chaleur near Bathurst, New Brunswick, as
	Pokeshaw was a busy seaport and sailing ships seemed to be a regular
	stop from overseas.  According to Pioneer Settlers of the Bay
	Chaleur, John purchased part of Lot 7 at Salmon Beach, between
	Pokeshaw and Bathurst,  from
	Fidele and Joseph Arceneau</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>On
	August 23, 1833, John Glendinning married Margaret Harley who had
	come from Ireland to New Brunswick to join other family members.  
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">Margaret
	Harley’s father, William, was of English descent but had moved to
	Courtmacsherry, a small town near Cork, Ireland to teach school.  He
	was Presbyterian and, apparently, quite active in the church.  At
	least one of the children, Mary Ann, was born in Courtmasherry and
	refers to herself as having been raised in the church.  Since
	Margaret was the youngest of the family, it is likely that she was
	born in Courtmacsherry as well.</p>

	<p align="justify">Margaret (Harley) Glendinning was a schoolteacher
	and the first school in Salmon Beach was opened in her home in 1838.
	 By 1842 a new school was opened at Upper Salmon Beach.  The school
	measure 12 feet by 12 feet by 6 feet and housed 27 pupils.  School
	reports of the time (1842, I believe) reported that:</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>

		<li><p>instruction

	</ul>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>According
	to the Bay Chaleur history, settlers raised sheep, carded and spun
	wool and wove cloth.  Settlers of the Bay of Chaleur tell that John
	Glendinning, presumably the Senior John, owned one of the first
	weaving machines (looms) in Canobie and taught others in the
	community to weave, however, I think that it is more likely that it
	was our Grandmother who taught weaving.  I recall my mother saying
	that Grandmother Glendenning possessed a shuttle.  Apparently, the
	shuttle passed to Aunt Venetia Doring and from her to Cornelia
	Farrell.</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>According
	to Pioneer Settlers, John and Margaret sold their land in 1855 to
	Abram Buttimer and moved inland to Canobie.  We do not know the
	reason for moving but we do know that waterfront land at Salmon
	Beach took a heavy beating and some flooding from storms.  Also with
	a growing family and cheap land he may have felt that he would give
	his family a better start in Canobie.</p>
	<p style="text-indent: 2in"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">John
	Glendinning petitioned for two lots of 100 acres each in Canobie
	(F5929, F5931)<u>.
	 </u>One
	petition shows the name as John Glendinning, Sr. and the other shows
	only John Glendinning but in both cases the age is given as
	forty-seven years so they are both the same person.  The petitions
	are faint and difficult to read.</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">One
	petition identifies the year as 1854 and mentions the west half of
	... (too faint to read)   No lot number is given.  The lot was
	vacant but had been improved by applicant.</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">The
	other petition, in 1855, clearly identifies lot #30 in Canobie which
	appears to have been surveyed in 1848 for Charles Scott.  The lot
	was vacant but improved - whether improved by John Glendinning,
	Charles Scott, or someone else we do not know.</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>It
	appears that John Glendinning petitioned for both Lots 30 and 31. 
	When the grants were made, however, they were in the names of his
	sons, John and Walter.  He and his family may have been living on
	the lot since it was not unusual for early settlers to live on land
	for a number of years before receiving title; they may have even
	been required to clear a number of acres and even build a house.

	The land is said to be occupied by the applicant, Walter

	<p>To the extent known, this section deals with
	actual ancestral families and their locations.  The nature and
	extent of information for each family or location varies, reflecting
	the extent of my search rather that available information.  In no
	way should this section be considered a complete family history.</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>While we usually carry the name of the male side
	of our ancestral family, in fact, each person is an equal descendant
	of many other families as well.  In the writer’s case, he is
	directly descended on his maternal side from families named Watling,
	Leech, MacNaughton, MacDonald, McAskill and Jardine.  These families
	reflect Highland and Lowland Scottish roots.  Of my maternal Great
	Grandparents, all were Scots except two.  
	</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>The Canadian roots of my maternal ancestors
	reside in the community where I was born, Black River, New Brunswick
	– a community some 10 miles south and east of Chatham.

	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">A.
	W. MacDougall says that the name Black River, in the MicMac language
	is <i>Mat-quan-ti-gook</i>
	- a term intended to describe its waters.    MacDougall describes at
	least one lot, at McDougall's Point near the mouth of the river,
	which was granted to Delesderniere and Marsten prior to 1784. 
	United Empire Loyalists came to Black River between 1785 and 1795. 
	Following this, there arrived mostly people from Scotland,
	highlanders and lowlanders alike, including MacDonalds (McDonalds),
	MacNaughtons, McBeaths and MacLeans.  Many came directly from
	Scotland while others are thought to have come to the Miramichi via
	Cape Breton, Prince Edward Island, or other Maritime ports.</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">The
	Black River flows from west to east and empties into Bay du Vin,
	which is part of the Miramichi River.  By 1800, grants had been made
	to settlers along the shores from Hexham east.  In 1812, there was a
	major push to settle the Black River including the Little Black
	River now known as the Little Branch.  Settlements on the upper
	reaches of the Black River came a decade later and the Meadows
	closer to mid- century.  Some specific settlement dates are found
	later in this chapter.</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">The
	area would have been completed wooded but river banks were
	relatively low with good access to water which was their means of
	transportation.  The forests would be part of what is known as the
	Acadian forest – a mixture of balsam firm spruce, cedar, with some
	white and yellow birch, beech, maple and a sprinkling of ash on the
	higher ground.

	<p align="justify"><b>Transportation</b></p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">Transportation
	between settlements was mainly by boat hence the fact that initial
	settlements were along rivers and shores.  The dates on which grants
	were made also reflect the fact that, in the case of Black River,
	settlement proceeded up the river from its mouth. Adjacent lands
	along at Hexham and in Miramichi (Bayside) were granted in the
	1780's and 1790's; settlers began to spread up the Black River, at
	least along the south side, after the turn of the century.  
	Initially blazed paths, and eventually roads were made between
	communities.  Elsewhere, I quoted my Great Grandmother’s sister,
	Mary Anne Harley, about her walk from Pokemouche through the woods
	to Newcastle.</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">Helena
	(Smith) Kingston remembered her father, or was it her grandfather?,
	traveling from Bayside to Loggieville by small boat to pick up
	supplies.  Later, commercial boats brought supplies from Loggieville
	dropping them off at various locations along the coast often taking
	fish on the return trip.</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">According
	to the History of Bay du Vin, 25 pounds Sterling was appropriated in
	1819 to develop a road from Black River to Bay du Vin.  In 1824,
	John Bailey Williston was given a sum of money to build to a width
	of 20 feet half the road from Bay du Vin to Black River.</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">Even
	when I was a youngster, I remember someone pointing out the “bark
	road” which by then was only an overgrown road where it crossed
	our property but could be more clearly seen and perhaps even used
	where it crossed the McKnight Road.  The Bark Road was used in
	winter to haul bark from the Black River area to be used in both
	Chatham and Newcastle during the shipbuilding era.  It likely
	started somewhere between Black River and Bay du Vin, crossed
	woodland properties in the Branch and Black River, crossed the
	river, travelled along the “short cut” towards Point Aux Carr
	then turned west, crossed the Napan road and eventually ended up at
	Chatham or Newcastle.</p>

	</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify"><b>The
	first Tasks</b></p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">On
	arrival, an immigrant would seek out a piece of land to make a home.
	 The land was heavily forested and the first task would be to make a
	clearing and prepare lodging for the coming winter, Homes were made
	of logs cut on the property by hand; crevices between the logs were
	stuffed with moss to keep out the cold and snow.  Logs not needed
	were used for firewood with the remaining burned as brush; the first
	seeds, wheat, oats, potatoes and garden vegetables were planted and
	harvested among the stumps - again by hand.  A root cellar kept
	vegetables from freezing during the long winters.</p>
	<p align="justify" style="orphans: 2; widows: 2"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify" style="widows: 2; orphans: 2"><b>Schools</b></p>
	<p align="justify" style="orphans: 2; widows: 2"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify" style="orphans: 2; widows: 2">Most
	of the early settlers in Black River spoke Gaelic.  Based on the
	work of A. W. McDougall, the first formal instruction in Black River
	was provided in a barn belonging to Archibald Cameron, Sr.  Later
	teachers provided instruction in their own homes.  In 1825,
	residents petitioned for the erection of a school, which was erected
	across the road from the Richard Godfrey residence (Until a few
	years ago, the residence of John Godfrey); this would be just east
	of the lane leading to St. Stephen’s church. This building seems
	to have served all of Black River and as far east as Bay du Vin. 
	About 1845, the district was divided with one school being built at
	Middle Black River and another at Bayside (now Miramichi).  A few
	years later a school was erected at Little Branch; shortly
	thereafter, the school burned but was soon replaced.  I have no
	information on dates for the first school in Upper Black River but
	believe that the first school was east of Route 11.</p>
	<p align="justify" style="orphans: 2; widows: 2"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify" style="orphans: 2; widows: 2">About
	1937, the Rev. Douglas Smith, Rector at St. John’s Anglican Church
	in Bay du Vin provided tutoring in the Rectory to high school
	students in the area; numbers grew including students from Black
	River.  Teachers were hired and classes were moved to the church
	hall.  In January 1940, the Miramichi Rural High School opened at
	Miramichi (Bayside) with 67 students enrolled.</p>

	George Fowlie erected a gristmill on the Little Black River, which
	commenced grinding last week.  We have seen some bread made of the

	has a never failing stream of water and will be a great

	</p>
	<p align="justify">At
	first the settlement was served by itinerant ministers and
	missionaries.  Among the visiting ministers was the Rev. Dr. James
	Drummond MacGregor, a Scot who had been sent out to minister to the
	Presbyterians in Pictou, Nova Scotia.  In addition to serving the
	folk of Pictou, MacGregor traveled throughout New Brunswick, Nova
	Scotia and Prince Edward Island.  Each visit to a community usually
	lasted several days, and even weeks, and included preaching,
	praying, and religious conversations.   The <u>Memoir
	of Rev. James MacGregor, D.D.</u>
	recount his visit to Black River (p.316) as follows:</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 0.5in">“<i>On
	the first and second visits to the Miramichi in 1797 and 1807, he
	preached and baptized at Black River, Bay du Vin, and on both sides
	of the Miramichi, up as far as the point, so called, at the junction
	of the North and South-west branches.  Those who recollect him
	remark his happy faculty in introducing religious conversation.”</i></p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">In
	1812, a church, thought to be Presbyterian, was built in at Tuckers
	Point, at the mouth of the Bay du Vin River on the west side. 
	(While Tucker’s Point was used in conversation by several people,
	the name does not appear in <u>Geographical
	Names of New Brunswick</u>
	by Rayburn, 1975.)  Some gravestones are still to be found in the
	area.  The church served all Protestants in the area.  
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">Given
	that Black River was a growing community and that most of the
	Presbyterians lived several miles from Tucker’s Point, a community
	of people who worshipped mostly in the English tradition, it is not
	surprising that talk soon turned, first to finding a Presbyterian
	minister and later to constructing a place of worship</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">W.
	MacDougall describes Gunn’s Point (part of Lot #4 granted to
	Alexander Gunn on June 3, 1812) as follows:</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 0.5in">“The
	proposed site for the church, which has long been known as Church
	Point, is a peninsula several acres in extent, jutting out from the
	mainland on the South Side of the Black River about three miles from
	its mouth, and connected to the shore by a narrow neck of land.  It
	has dry sandy soil, and at that time was partly covered with a heavy
	growth of timber.  It is an ideal location for a church, probably
	without parallel in the whole Province.  A portion of it had
	previously been used as a burial ground, and there it was decided to
	build the church.”</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">On
	April 21, 1835 a contract was awarded to William Porteous to erect
	the church; structural timber was cut locally.  The building was 45
	feet long by 30 feet wide with an 18-foot wall.  On November 20,
	1836, the first house of worship, St Stephen’s Presbyterian
	Church, was formally opened with the Rev. Mr. Fraser as its first
	minister.</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify"> By
	the turn of the century, St. Stephen’s sanctuary had become quite
	dilapidated and, instead of making repairs, a decision was taken to
	build a new sanctuary.  The result was the opening of the present
	sanctuary on December 30, 1906.</p>
	<p align="justify" style="orphans: 2; widows: 2"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify" style="orphans: 2; widows: 2">As
	a result of the creation of the United Church of Canada in 1925,
	members who wished to continue in the Presbyterian faith found
	themselves without a church building.  For a few years they met in
	member’s homes or in schools.  In 1930, St. Paul’s Presbyterian
	Church was officially opened; St. Stephens continues to serve the
	community as St. Stephens United Church.

	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>The
	Gaelic spelling of MacDonald, meaning the son of Donald, is Mac
	Dhomhnuill.  – but there were many Donalds.  The Macdonalds were a
	very large clan having taken many septs under their wing.</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>Alexander
	MacDonald was a native of the Parish of Assynt in Rosshire,
	Scotland.  That area of northwest Scotland is hilly and rocky with
	many inlets and streams with little land suitable for cultivation;
	the county also includes many islands</p>

	(I believe a relative of the giant Mac Askill of Cape Breton) and

	<p align="justify">The
	original MacDonald home, I believe, was close to the river in the
	field just above where Norman Glendenning now lives.  There was an
	old apple orchard there as well as a depression in the ground, which
	we always thought was the old cellar.  Teddy Fowlie once said that
	his father, Bill Fowlie, remembered the old homestead in that
	location; other4s remembered a barn.  Lillian (Glendenning) Weeks
	remembered a pile of lumber in that area that she thinks was the
	remnants of the old home.  I remember a pump in the field on Uncle
	Jim’s property, not far from the orchard, and wonder if it may
	have been part of the original Macdonald homestead.  In any case,
	the land sloped from there to the river making easy access by boat.

	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">Settlers
	frequently lived on their land even before legal transfer.  Once
	there, and depending on the time of year, a clearing was required to
	build a home, and a barn, vegetables would be planted among the
	stumps with seeds brought with them from the old country and a root
	cellar would be dug for winter storage.</p>

	in a canoe.  Land being plentiful, Mr. MacDonald decided to secure
	as large a grant as possible.  After he had gone a considerable
	distance, his further progress was barred by a creek, but he plunged
	in and waded across, only to be brought to a halt on the other side

	<h6>D	JARDINE</h6>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>According
	to the “<u>Jardines
	of Atlantic Canada”</u>,
	is of French origin meaning “a dweller at or near a garden.  A
	Jardine fought with William the Conqueror at the Battle of Hastings
	in 1066; it is assumed therefore that the Jardines came from
	Normandy with William.  We do not know for certain if the Jardines
	in Scotland found their way north from England or if they came as
	part of another wave of conquerors from Normandy a few years later,
	however, the first written record of the name of Jardine in Scotland
	was in 1150.</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>The
	Jardines, as with the Glendennings, were Border people.  That is,
	they lived in Dumfriesshire and within 30 to 40 miles of the Border,
	and even closer to the birthplace of my Great Grandfather, John
	Glendinning at Callister Hall not far from Lockerbie.</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>The
	earliest reference to Jardines in my family is Joseph Jardine, born
	in 1767 in Tundergarth, Dumfriesshire, Scotland in 1767.  He married
	Janet Kerr, born in 1772 in Loveland, Scotland and they married on
	November 16, 1792.  It is believed that some of the children were
	born in Scotland, however, Joseph was granted land in Napan on
	February 27, 1827.  Joseph, my GGG Grandfather, died in Napan in
	1849 and Janet in 1860.  Their children include:</p>

	started near Dover, passed through Canterbury, turned north at

	that the Watlings were Vikings who landed in Northern Scotland in
	870 AD, invaded northern France in 910 AD and then came to England

	<p style="margin-left: -0.06in">By
	the time of Richard 1 the Watling name had spread north to
	Watlingford in Oxfordshire, Watlington in Norfolk, Essex and
	Hertfordshire.  Many Norman families moved north to Scotland in the
	12<sup>th</sup>

	<p style="margin-left: -0.06in">Watling
	is thought to share the same roots as Whatling, Watlington,
	Watlingtone, Whatlington, Whatlingtone, Wadling, and Wadlingdon.

	</p>
	<p style="margin-left: 0.5in">“<i>In
	the 5</i><sup><i>th</i></sup><i>/6</i><sup><i>th</i></sup><i>
	century a band of people crossed the North Sea from Europe to the
	British Isles, we do not know if it was one or more boats, but as a
	yachtsman sailing these waters I would suppose the latter, there
	being safety in numbers.  They knew where they were going as trading
	was and had taken place long before, also they would have had oral
	stories from their forebearers who might have served in the Roman
	Legions, without a shred of evidence I like to think that they were
	Angles, or possibly Jute in origin rather than Saxon.  The leader of
	this band was WACEAL, and those with him of the same clan, tribe or
	group were the Waceal – ingas.  Ingas was not the son of as in the
	Scottish Watson, but meaning people of or followers of Waceal, so
	members of this group would be referred to as Wacelaingas.  As time
	past the name began to change from, the vowels hardening, or
	softening, plus the input of people from other tongues and one form
	was Waselin.  The earliest records I have are for Norfolk 1086, the
	DOOM’D DAY BOOK.  In this book is recorded the Manor in the Half
	Hudred Diss, today scholars call it a lost Manor as its whereabouts
	are unknown.  (I have my own theory, but that is another story)  The
	Manor of Watlingeseta it states was held by the king (William in
	1086, and before 1066 Edward the Confessor).  Also recorded in the
	book is Wazalin who held land in Weeting, Norfolk, one of the few
	Anglo Saxons still holding land after William the Bastard and his
	bunch of land grabbing thugs won the Battle of Hastings.  Watling
	Street was built by the Romans during their occupation and the name
	came after the Roman period, the present day town of St. Albans was
	originally Watlingcaster, but after the martyrdom of St. Alban the
	name changed, it can be supposed that the Wacealingas lived there.”</i></p>

	in 1792.   Watling is quoted a number of times on the barrenness of

	because he would not allow his crew to play cards or indulge in
	piracy on the Sabbath.  The name Watling appears frequently in
	literature about the Bahamas.  There may have also been a pirate
	named John Watling.  I am sure that neither of these were part of

	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>According to the 1841 census, Jubal Watling was
	between 45 and 60 years of age, head of the family, his trade or
	occupation was that of a mason, he had 100 acres of land but one
	cannot tell if he rented or owned the land.  The household consisted
	of Jubal as head, one female between the ages of 45 and 60

	of the household were born in England and two were natives of the

	<p>The

	Metfield, Suffolk County, England on November 14, 1814.  Later they
	appear to have moved to Syleham, Suffolk County, England where their
	son, Jubal was baptized on August 17, 1823.  I believe that Jubal

	</p>
	<p>Jubal
	Watling married Susan Leach in Metfield, Suffolk County, England on
	November 14, 1814.  In 1823, they were in Syleham, Suffolk County,
	England where their son, Jubal was baptized on August 17, 1823.  I
	found no evidence of Jubal and Susan coming to Canada, although it
	is possible.  A note in Kenneth Watling’s database says that Jubal
	migrated to the USA -  we do not know the year.  From my research, I
	believe that to be the Jubal who married Christina MacNaughton.  
	</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>Family
	lore says that Jubal came to Black River via Cape Breton and maybe
	PEI; that is certainly possible.  My search of PEI archives revealed
	a number of Watlings, including a Jubal, but the names, dates and
	marriage information did not match that of the Black River Watlings.

	<p>My

	brother had inherited the farm when his father died, was not
	married, was living at home but was not able to operate the farm. 
	As best I can interpret, the land did not include the Jessie
	McDonald property where Norman Glendenning now lives.</p>

	their natural lives with good and sufficient house, room, meat,
	drink, washing, clothing, bedding, fire, light, medicine, medical
	attendance, personal expenses and all such necessaries as persons of
	their ages and conditions in life usually require and are accustomed

	</p>
	<p lang="en-GB"><br />

	</p>
	<p lang="en-GB">Elmer
	Glendenning was born in Canobie, presumably at the homestead, on
	June 29, 1875.  He was the second child, and the first son, born to
	Walter and Elizabeth (Peters) Glendenning; their daughter, Venetia,
	was the oldest.    
	</p>
	<p lang="en-GB"><br />

	</p>
	<p>Elmer’s
	grandfather, John Glendinning, came from Scotland in 1830, purchased
	land at Salmon Beach  and married Margaret Harley who taught school.
	 Sometime between 1855 and 1861, they sold their land at Salmon
	Beach and moved to Canobie presumably because crown land was still
	available there.  John Glendinning petitioned for two lots, Nos. 30
	and 31, in Canobie.  In actual fact, it appears that John Sr. never
	did get title to land but it went directly to his two sons instead. 
	
	</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>This
	land is directly across the road from the Canobie School, which is
	now the Women’s Institute Hall; the family home where Elmer grew
	up would have been in what is now a small grove of trees.   
	</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p style="text-indent: -0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in">Elmer’s
	father, Walter Glendenning, married
	Elizabeth
	Peters, a near neighbour, 
	</p>
	<p style="text-indent: -0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in">On
	March 2,1872 and, on February 17, 1873, Walter was granted Lot 30. 
	</p>
	<p style="text-indent: -0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in"> Walter’s
	brother, John, had already married and moved to the lot next door. 
	</p>
	<p style="text-indent: -0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in">Walter’s
	father and mother continued to live in the old home until their
	deaths,</p>
	<p style="text-indent: -0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in">John,
	Sr. in 1877 and Elizabeth in 1895.</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p>As
	a young man, Elmer would have gone to the one room school next door,
	actually on a corner of his Uncle’s lot.  The school would have
	been heated by a wood stove and served by an outside privy.  It may
	or may not have had a pump for water.   
	</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p lang="en-GB">Elmer
	would have been lucky to have had 6 – 8 years of schooling.  We
	know, however, that the family seems to have valued education; this
	is not surprising in that his grandmother was a teacher and lived in
	the home until Elmer was 20.  As further evidence, his brother, Chip
	took a business course, Guy studied but did not finish dentistry and
	Margaret trained as a nurse.  It is likely that Dad took some
	technical courses; I remember some engineering books at home.  His
	oldest sister, Venetia, provided a home for their sister, Margaret,
	so that she could finish high school in Portland; I believe that
	Uncle Guy also completed high school there; maybe others did as
	well.  
	</p>
	<p lang="en-GB"><br />

	</p>
	<p>Elmer’s
	father was active in the building of the nearby church, a church
	used by Presbyterians, Methodists and the Church of England, hence
	the name Trinity Union Church.  Census records gave his father’s
	church affiliation as Presbyterian roots while his mother’s
	affiliation was Church of England.  Convenience to church was likely
	a deciding factor.</p>
	<p lang="en-GB" align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p lang="en-GB" align="justify">Elmer’s
	father was a farmer and, judging by the amount of land accumulated,
	a successful one at that.  Elmer, and all the boys, and maybe even
	the girls, would be expected to do their share.  The land would have
	to be cleared of trees, and those who know Canobie, will remember
	the stony fields; and all the work would be done by hand or with the
	aid of horses.</p>
	<p lang="en-GB" align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">We do not know the year that Elmer went to the
	USA, where he went first or what he did.  According to the US census
	of 1910, Frank Glendenning arrived in the USA in 1898; furthermore,
	we know that Elmer was living in Portland by 1901.  He probably knew
	people, even friends, who went to Maine or New Hampshire during the
	winter to work in the woods and then return to farm and fish in the
	summer; he may have even done that himself.  Or he may have gone
	first because of having relatives in the area.  
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">We know, for example, that an Aunt, Mary Ann
	(Harley) who had married a Stevens and lived next door for a while
	in Canobie, had moved to Portland to be with family after her
	husband died in 1870.   Or Elmer and his sister, Venetia, may even
	have gone off to Portland together.  Or perhaps he and his first
	cousin, a Knowles, decided to make the move.  We do not really know.
	 Land grant records show that Lot # 28 in Canobie, 100 acres, was
	granted to Atton E. Glendenning on 1901-07-06.  This would be Alton
	E. Glendenning; I believe that this was the lot that Uncle Chip
	lived on.</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p>However it came about, Glendennings seemed to
	have been well established in Portland in the first decade of the
	1900s.  Venetia, the oldest child, likely having played the role of
	&quot;host&quot; as each new family member moved south.  Venetia's
	address was Falmouth Foreside which is just north of Portland and
	between Portland and Freeport.  Falmouth Foreside still exists
	although it may be considered part of the Portland metropolitan area
	today.  Brothers and sisters known to have lived in Portland, at
	least for a while, included Venetia (Mrs R. L. Doring), Margaret
	(Mrs Lucas Marsen), Frank, Raymond and Guy.   In addition, Aunt
	Maude and her husband, Jim Cormier lived in Lincoln, New Hampshire
	where Uncle Jim Cormier worked in the mill, and Leonard and his
	family lived in Maine.

	</p>
	<p lang="en-GB" align="center"><br />

	</p>
	<p lang="en-GB" align="justify">Prior
	to his marriage in 1910, we know that his work was of three kinds. 
	He and his brother, Frank, and perhaps other brothers as well,
	operated a trucking business under the name Glendenning Bros. &amp;
	Co. (All Kinds of Team Work). Robert Glendenning told me that his
	father, Guy, also worked in the cartage business; whether he was a
	partner is not known.  I believe that Uncle Rae also worked in the
	business as a blacksmith.  They operated from 24 Hammond Street,
	Portland, Maine..  They had horses and wagons and did all kinds of
	trucking.  Portland was the terminus of the Great Northern Railway,
	later the CNR, which meant that much goods would be moved, in all
	kinds of combinations, from trains, ships to warehouses, retail
	stores and homes.  One role Dad told about was that of delivering
	ice to homes; there were few, if any, electric refrigerators in
	those days.  Cakes of ice were picked up at the ice plant, loaded on
	a wagon, driven to the residential neighbourhood, carried with the
	aid of ice tongs into the house and placed in the icebox.</p>
	<p lang="en-GB" align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p lang="en-GB" align="justify">In
	August 1993, while in Portland, I visited Hammond Street. The area
	was primarily commercial and fronts on Back Cove.  It is in East
	Portland which is known as Munjoy Hill.  This section of the city
	had completely been rebuilt and there was no trace of #24 Hammond
	Street.    Uncle Frank Glendenning lived nearby at 72 Wilmot Street.
	 We do not know where Dad lived.</p>

	</p>
	<p align="justify"><span lang="en-GB">We
	also know that Dad worked in the woods, we believe in both Maine and
	New Hampshire, but possibly also in Vermont.  My brother, Walter,
	thought that Dad worked in the woods near Skowhegan and Millinocket,
	Maine.  Old photos in Mother’s collection, show men and teams in
	front of a lumber mill in Berlin, New Hampshire.   My brother, John,
	told of a record set by Dad and his crew for the number of board
	feet of lumber cut in one day.  The accomplishment was marked on a
	lumber camp wall.  Brother, Ken, remembers his Uncle George telling
	the same story.</span></p>

	</p>
	<p lang="en-GB" align="justify">It
	is likely, that the horses used in the cartage business in Portland,
	or some of them at least, were shipped by train to the woods area
	although they may have been supplemented by horses and drivers from
	the local the area.</p>

	<br />

	</p>
	<p lang="en-GB" align="justify">Obviously,
	Elmer had a network of New Brunswickers with whom he worked in the
	woods, including Uncles Jim and George Watling, and Ramsay MacLean
	of Upper Black River.  (Interesting to note that Ramsay was a nephew
	of Adam MacLean who married Dad’s first cousin, Millie.) 
	According to Herbert Daley, Herb Daley, Dad’s first cousin, also
	worked in the woods with Dad.

	<p lang="en-GB"><br />

	</p>
	<p lang="en-GB">As
	we know, New Hampshire is very hilly.  I recall Brother John saying
	that he thought that Ramsay had been yarding with a horse or a team
	and, and did not install a bridle to slow down the sled on a steep
	hill.  The load of logs got away from him and dragged the horses
	down the hillside killing one or both horses.  From my reading of
	lumbering on the hills in New Hampshire, this would not have been an
	unusual event.</p>

	25, 1910 he mailed a letter from  Wausau to Jeannie Glendenning in
	Portland.  A postcard picture dated July 18, 1910 shows work being
	done at a dam in Rothschild, Wisconsin.   Quite a number of dams
	were built in Wisconsin at this time.  Some were built to improve
	the rafting of logs; others were built for the generation of power.

	<p lang="en-GB" align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p lang="en-GB" align="justify">He
	also gave, Wisconsin, as his address when he made an entry in Mum's
	autograph album on September 18, 1910, a month before they were
	married.  In fact, Dad’s is the only entry in the album prior to
	their wedding which makes me think that he may have given the album
	to Mum as a memento when he returned from Wisconsin.  I would guess
	that he simply stopped in Portland for a few days on his way back to
	New Brunswick to be married.

Watling was born, presumably at  home, at the Meadows, Upper Black

as Uncle Ern and Aunt Janet called her) while the Glendenning side of
the family referred to her as Jean.  I remember Mum saying that Dad
referred to her as &quot;Jeannie with the light brown hair&quot;.

<p lang="en-GB" align="justify">Jane
was the second youngest of a family of eight born to Jubal Watling
and Grace MacAskill MacDonald.   She was named after Jane Elizabeth
Jardine who married Donald Cameron (Cameron Russell’s grandmother) 
A few years ago when visiting Francis and Phyllis MacNaughton in
Vancouver, Phyllis showed a framed, handmade embroidery (?) made by
Jane Elizabeth Jardine.</p>
<p lang="en-GB" align="justify"><br />

</p>
<p lang="en-GB" align="justify">When
Mum was about 10 years old, the family moved from the Meadows to the
Branch.  We know that she went to school in Upper Black River; it is
unlikely that she went or went for very long to the school at the
Branch.  I remember Mum saying that her mother would take her from
school to help Aunt Elspie MacNaughton who had a young and growing
family and needed help.</p>
<p lang="en-GB" align="justify"><br />

</p>
<p lang="en-GB" align="justify"><b>Portland,
Maine</b></p>
<p lang="en-GB" align="justify"><br />

</p>
<p lang="en-GB" align="justify">Jane
Watling arrived in Portland on January 24, 1908 just prior to her
18th birthday.  In the same way as Maritimers now go to Ontario,
points west or overseas, in those days young people went to &quot;the
Boston States&quot;. Young women frequently were employed to look
after children and to do housework. 
</p>
<p lang="en-GB" align="justify"><br />

</p>
<p lang="en-GB" align="justify">The
exact date that of her arrival in Portland is known only because she
arrived there on the day that the City Hall burned.   I have since
confirmed, through a phone call to the Portland Public Library, that
the fire occurred on January 24, 1908.  (I also recalled Mum saying
that she could have gone to Walter Glendenning's funeral (which was
on February 14, 1908) but she kept, I think, Aunt Millie
(glendenning) Maclean’s children.  
</p>
<p lang="en-GB" align="justify"><br />

</p>
<p lang="en-GB" align="justify">Jane
arrived at the train station in Portland in the early morning and
waited for her brother, George, to meet her. Apparently he came to
the station but did not recognize her; she had grown up while he was
away from Black River.  Her brother Jack also worked in Portland at
that time and likely there were many cousins. We also know that her
brother Jim worked in Portland in a chemist/pharmacy, and also in
photography, but whether he was there at that time we do not know.  
</p>
<p lang="en-GB" align="justify"><br />

</p>
<p lang="en-GB" align="justify">Among
Mum’s possessions was an envelope, addressed in Dad’s handwriting
and mailed from Wisconsin, showing Mum’s address as 130 Emery
Street, Portland.</p>
<p lang="en-GB" align="justify"><br />

</p>
<p lang="en-GB" align="justify">We
think that Mum worked for a Mrs. Jennison and looked after her two
sons, Marshall and Brian.  We do not know the dates.  In 1952, John
and Mary took their son, Frankie, to Boston to see a doctor.  Mum and
I went along.  While there, we visited a friend of Mum’s (I believe
it was Mrs. Jennison.)  She lived on the second or third floor of a
brick apartment building in Worcester near Framingham.</p>

Brackett who was born about 1908 and graduated from high school in
Portland in 1925.  In 1949, I think, John and Mary took their son,
Frankie, to a doctor in Boston.  While there we visited Mrs. Jennison
who then lived in an apartment building in Worcester, Mass. Just
outside Boston.  		</span></p>

mother wrote poetry.  Family members remembered seeing some of it but
it appeared that none had survived.  At a family reunion a few years

mother and, subsequently, she sent the above poem to me.  This poem
was written about a month after her mother died.</p>

	</p>
	<p lang="en-GB" align="justify">For
	years, Maritimers flocked to the USA to find work; this trend did
	not really change until after WW2 when Maritimers travelled west,
	first to work in the plants in Ontario but later to work in the
	oilfields of Alberta.    I am told three times a day, trains left
	Prince Edward Island and made connections with trains to the Boston
	States.</p>
	<p lang="en-GB" align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p lang="en-GB" align="justify">Many
	Maritimers found their first jobs in the woods of Maine and New
	Hampshire, initially in winter only.  Many returned home to fish or
	farm in the summer; later many found year-round work and eventually
	became permanent residents.  Young women, including my Mother and,
	later, my two sisters went to Portland or Boston and found work with
	families looking for a nanny, a cook, a housekeeper or “jill of
	all trades”.</p>
	<p lang="en-GB" align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p>In the late 1800's, Portland was the terminus of
	the Atlantic and St. Lawrence Railroad (Grand Trunk), a line to
	Montreal which &quot;made Portland into Canada's winter port&quot;. 
	Other heavy industry was to be found in that area of Portland
	including the building of locomotives and the construction of docks
	to accommodate transatlantic passenger vessels.  Street names St.
	Lawrence, Quebec and Montreal for example further reflect the
	Canadian connection.</p>
	<p lang="en-GB" align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p lang="en-GB" align="justify">Some
	1500 buildings were destroyed and 12 000 people left homeless in the
	great fire of 1866.  New and presumably better housing was
	constructed and it appears that lighter industry began to locate in
	that area.  Around the turn of the century a few grand homes began
	to appear on the Promenade which provided a sweeping view of the
	water.  Construction provided many jobs and it is likely that Dad
	worked in the construction trade field.  In fact, Walter recalled a
	trip to Portland with Dad and a visit to a construction site to see
	some friends.</p>
	<p lang="en-GB" align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p lang="en-GB" align="justify">In
	the context of all the industrial activity and development, it is
	not surprising that Portland attracted Maritimers, including the
	Glendenning and Watling families.</p>
	<p lang="en-GB" align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p>Earlier sections dealt with Elmer’s and Jane’s
	roots including the communities in which they grew up.  It was in
	Portland that their paths crossed in a way that lead to their
	marriage.  This section describes, as best I can, some of their
	early experience as a family in the USA. 
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">I
	am interested in the fact that so many of the Glendennings and
	Watlings, lived and worked in the USA.  On the Watling side, Mum
	went to Portland just before her 18<sup>th</sup>
	birthday; Uncle Jack worked in the Boston area and eventually
	retired to an Island near Portland, Uncle George lived in Portland
	for a while but, according to Elbridge, also worked in Tennessee and
	Virginia before moving to New Hampshire; Aunt Janet worked at the
	Waltham watch factory but returned to Black River, Uncle Jim worked
	for a number of years in a chemists/ photography shop in Portland
	but came back to Little Branch after his father died; Uncle Ern
	worked with Dad in Tennessee before enlisting in WW1.  Uncle Jim
	Watling, I believe, had not been well and worked in the woods with
	Dad as, I believe, a cook.</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">On
	the Glendenning side, Dad operated a trucking business with his
	brothers in Portland and also lumbered in New Hampshire and likely
	Maine.  After their marriage in 1910, Dad worked on construction
	sites in Tennessee, Connecticut, Virginia, Wisconsin, Alabama and
	Texas; Aunt Venetia lived near Portland and eventually moved to
	Florida; Uncle Guy went to school Dental school in the USA, worked
	in the USA and Peru and eventually settled in Florida; Uncle Chip
	worked for a number of years in Peru; Uncle Ray worked in Portland
	and may have worked in the woods in New Hampshire; Aunt Minnie lived
	most of her life on Long Island, Aunt Margaret finished high school
	in Portland, then took nurses training, she served as a nurse during
	WW1 and settled in Maine; Uncle Leonard lived for a number of years
	in Maine but returned to NB; Aunt Maude and Uncle Jim Cormier lived
	in New Hampshire but returned to NB.</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">My
	mother told of her arrival in Portland on January 24, 1908, a month
	before her 18<sup>th</sup>
	birthday.  She arrived on the day the city hall burned.  She was to
	stay with Uncle George.  She arrived at the train station early in
	the morning but Uncle George did not show.  Apparently he had come
	to the railway depot but he had been away for a number of years and
	did not recognize the grown, young woman in the station waiting
	room. 
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">Less
	than three weeks later my Grandfather Glendenning died while
	visiting family in Portland. Mother knew, or knew of, the
	Glendennings by then and could have gone to the funeral.  Instead,
	as I recall, she looked after someone’s children – children of
	Adam and Millie (Glendenning) MacLean.  I have always been curious
	as to how Mum and Dad met.</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">I
	find it interesting that both sides of our family were so
	venturesome and would welcome information about members of the next
	generation who traveled to the USA to seek employment.

	We

	they met through Uncle George Watling if, as we think, she stayed
	with him when she first went to Portland and if, as I also believe,
	he worked with Dad in New Hampshire (and perhaps in the cartage
	business in Portland).  I recall Mum saying that she could have gone
	to Grandpa Glendenning's funeral (Feb. 14, 1908) but, as I recall,
	she kept someone's children.   Jane was always active in church work
	and it is possible that they met at a church function.  On the other
	hand, there were hundreds of Maritimers working in the USA at that
	time and it is not unlikely that there was a network Maritimers in
	the Portland area.

	Elmer
	and Jane were married at the home of her parents, Mr. and Mrs. Jubal
	Watling at Little Branch by Rev. George Grant on October 18, 1910.
	Venetia recalls Dad telling about travelling by train from Portland
	to Loggieville, then by horse and wagon to Little Branch. 
	Apparently, at that time, there was a corduroy road from the Napan
	Road down through the woods, which joined the Point Aux Carr Road
	near Palmers.  From there he would have crossed the Victoria Bridge
	to Hexham and from there to the Watling home at Little Branch (where
	Neil now lives).  Lillian said they honeymooned in Montreal.  They
	returned to Portland (Bonny Eagle) after the wedding.</p>

	Parksville
	is in the south east corner of Tennessee about 30 miles east of
	Chattanooga and 15 or 20 miles east of Cleveland. It is located on
	the Ocoee River which rises in the mountains of eastern Tennessee,
	western Georgia, and north-eastern Alabama. The Ocoee River flows
	westward into the Tennessee River at Cleveland. Most of the
	buildings in the original town of Parksville were moved to make way
	for the dam and the original site is now under Parksville Lake. (The
	Ocoee River above Parksville was the location of some of the rafting
	events for 1996 Olympics held in Atlanta, Georgia).  Parksville is
	in Polk County whose capital is Benton about seven miles distant.</p>

	A

	at Caney Creek.  Construction commenced in May 1912 and was
	completed in October 1912. Many people who had worked on the
	Parksville dam were called back a few months later to work on the
	second dam and flume line. From entries in the autograph album, we
	know that Mum and Dad were among this group.  We do not know if
	there was a break in Dad's employment and, if there was, if they
	stayed in Parksville or went somewhere else until work resumed.  The
	reason for thinking this is that entries in her journal end on
	November 8, 1911 and commence again on April, 1912.  There are no
	entries for May, 1912, however, entries resume on June 1 under the

	The flume line is situated on ledges blasted out of the side of the
	mountain and on trestles where it crosses ravines and gullies. The
	flume line is fed from a small diversion dam and only drops 17.5
	feet in the 5 miles. The flume was made of &quot;long leafed pine&quot;
	timber, like railway ties, and was cut locally. It is actually a box
	about 10 feet high, 15 feet wide ad 5 miles long. Apparently a small
	&quot;dinky&quot; railroad ran on top of the flume line as the flume
	progressed.  This is not to be confused with the regular rail line

	The

	work at Parksville and the power station is operated remotely from
	another site.  Most of the houses have been torn down or moved.
	Presumably they were all company houses. Today, only three or four
	of the original buildings still stand. They are located on a gentle
	slope back from the river below the dam. Remaining buildings are

	<p lang="en-GB" align="justify">About
	this period of their life, we have little information.  We know,
	however, that for approximately two years they came back to New
	Brunswick and purchased a place at Little Branch.</p>
	<p lang="en-GB" align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p lang="en-GB" align="justify">Their
	first child, Grace, was born in Parksville, Tennessee and the dam,
	Ocoee #1 was completed by end of 1912.  From Mum’s autograph
	album, I would say that Uncle Ern and Hughey, (Mack) Macdonald left
	Parksville at the end of Novembe, 1912, and returned to Canada</p>
	<p lang="en-GB" align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p><span lang="en-GB">About
	the same time, Mum and Dad moved up river to work on the second dam
	and flume line, Ocoee #2.  </span>A
	reference in Mum’s record book shows them living at Goforth Creek
	in 1913.  Goforth Creek was the base camp for the second dam and the
	one where Mum had to cross the river on a suspension bridge.  
	</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>Mum
	was in New Brunswick when Walter was born in September, 1913; she
	may have stayed all winter or she may have returned to Tennessee.  
	We know, however, that Dad purchased the property from Jessie
	Macdonald on July 12, 1914 and was listed by Canada Post as being
	Postmaster at Little Branch on November 1 of the same year. 
	Presumably Dad had moved to the Branch from Tennessee by then.</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>Mum’s
	father, Jubal Watling, died on Feb 16, 1915 and Venetia was born in
	New Brunswick on May 15, 1915.  On August 1, 1916 Dad resigned as
	Postmaster and sometime thereafter the family moved to North Haven,
	Connecticut where Lillian was born on January 8, 1917.</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>We
	know little of their activities during this period at Little Branch
	but presumably Dad would be busy fixing up the farm, Mum would be
	busy with the children and both would be active in the church and
	the community.

	Glendenning to Dad dated May 30, 1918 and addressed to Langley

	charge of the clearing land for Langley Field.  Langley Field was a

	they lived on the Langley base, presumably in quarters provided for

	<p lang="en-GB" align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p lang="en-GB" align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p lang="en-GB" align="justify">I
	believe that Elmer and Jane Glendenning returned to New Brunswick in
	1919 although I do not know the exact date nor even if they
	travelled together.  Named and dated photos in Mum’s collection,
	show that the family was in Mussel Shoals, Alabama in the earlier
	part of 1919.  John was born on December 14, 1919 in Black River;
	the younger children would have been there as well since we recall
	Mum’s many stories of her return trips to Canada for the birth of
	a child.  So the move must have occurred earlier that year.  One
	might assume that the family moved at latest during the summer so
	that the children, at least Walter and Grace, could enrol in the
	Little Branch School by September.  They already had a house waiting
	so temporary accommodation following the move would not have been a
	major problem.   Discussions with siblings suggest that their return
	was in May, 1919.</p>
	<p lang="en-GB" align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p lang="en-GB" align="justify">Dad
	had purchased the property at Little Branch, where Norman
	Glendenning now lives, from Alexander and Ethyl MacDonald; who lived
	in their property during their absence, if anyone, we do not know. 
	</p>
	<p lang="en-GB" align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p lang="en-GB" align="justify">Their
	property was known as the Jessie MacDonald property.  &quot;Miss
	Jessie&quot;, who was a schoolteacher, died in 1912.  This property
	was directly across the road from where mother had lived as a child
	and where her mother and father, and Uncle Jim Macdonald still
	lived.  The western property line, starting at the Little Branch
	School, forms the back property line for many of the properties
	along Black River.  The rear of the property was known as Jessie's
	Corner - probably at the rear of either the Godfrey or Gibson
	property.   While I have not completed my search or county records,
	I believe that the property passed from John MacDonald to Jessie and
	on her death from Jessie to her nephew, Alexander MacDonald, who
	sold it to my father.</p>
	<p lang="en-GB" align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p lang="en-GB" align="justify">The
	original house, owned by Miss Jessie, was a traditional “story and
	a half” with a gable roof and built end on to the road.  Dad added
	an ell, likely in the early 1920’s; by 1920, they had five
	children and the house must have been very crowded.  Most if not all
	of the lumber for the addition was cut on the property, including a
	hardwood for the floor and pine for pantry cabinets ( I remember the
	pantry cabinets and cupboard doors made of a single piece of pine
	cut on the property – and hand planed..  The space added to the
	main floor included a large kitchen, pantry, back entry and another
	stairway to the second floor.  A basement was included under the
	entire house.  Two bedrooms and a large closet/storage room were
	added on the second floor; As I recall, that closet was considered a
	likely location for a modern bathroom.  He also added a closed-in
	veranda along the entire front of the house.</p>
	<p lang="en-GB" align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p lang="en-GB" align="justify">The
	barn was also enlarged by doubling its length and adding a shed at
	the back and included stalls for five horses, a new set of large
	doors to a new “barn floor”, haymow, and some pigpens.  At some
	point a machinery shed and workshop was added to the west end of the
	barn, and a henhouse and grain shed were built as separate
	buildings.  And of course, one must not forget the two-hole
	outhouse.</p>
	<p lang="en-GB" align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p lang="en-GB" align="justify">During
	his lifetime, Dad added purchased five pieces of property in the
	community; he now had a place for each of his sons.  
	</p>
	<p lang="en-GB" align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<ul>
		<li><p lang="en-GB" align="justify">Dad
		had purchased the property at Little Branch, where Norman

		</p></li>
	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li><p lang="en-GB" align="justify">On
		June 11, 1924, he purchased 18 acres of land from James Finno for
		the sum of $900.00.  
		</p></li>
		<li><p lang="en-GB" align="justify">On
		July 27, 1929 he purchased the &quot;Mac&quot; place from Jane
		MacDougall.  Venetia thought that the property, up to Hexham
		corner, was owned by Jane and Anne MacDougall.  Later Bob and
		Bioney MacDougall moved to the house at Hexham from their place
		down on MacDougall’s Point beyond Harper's.</p></li>
	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li><p lang="en-GB" align="justify">He
		purchased about 70 acres of land, with 12 acres cleared, from Dan
		MacLean.  Dan, who was a Great-Uncle to Everard and Harry MacLean
		who are residents of Black River, lived on the property with his
		sister Lizzie.  When Dan died, Lizzie moved to the &quot;poor
		house&quot;.  Agnes (Gibson) Glendenning remembers when Dan died -
		likely in the early 1920's.  Walter built a house there in 1938 and
		1939 and he and Agnes lived there until 1958.</p></li>
		<li><p lang="en-GB" align="justify">In
		1931 Dad purchased a property from Bob Mac Lean, Dan's brother. 
		The arrangement allowed Bob to live in the house until he died. 
		According to the agreement, Bob was able to keep some barbed wire
		fencing (This was before herd-law and fencing was needed to protect
		ones crops from roving cows.); he  could also harvest a field of
		oats.  The deed also provided a right of way right of way to the
		Dan MacLean property.  Records show also that Mrs Moodie, Bob’s
		sister?, held a mortgage on the property.  As I recall, Harry
		MacLean discovered Bob dead in the house in the early 1940's.  John
		and Mary built a house on the Bob MacLean property.  The old
		MacLean house was fixed up and is still used for storage</p></li>
		<li><p lang="en-GB" align="justify">On
		November 29, 1926, Dad bought property from James A. and Kathryn
		Watling.  For some reason, the transaction was not registered until
		September 17, 1929.  This property, I believe, was the narrow strip
		of woods between Uncle Jim and Ian MacNaughton.</p></li>
		<li><p lang="en-GB" align="justify">On
		September 9, 1936, Dad purchased a 100 acre woodlot, Lot 7B,  from

	</p>
	<h3>Mixed Farm</h3>
	<p lang="en-GB" align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p lang="en-GB" align="justify">The
	farm was a mixed farm, that is, it included such animals as cows,
	pigs, hens, geese, horses, turkeys; crops included a farm garden,
	oats, barley, wheat, buckwheat, and hay.  As a result, income, or
	other good through trade, was obtained from eggs, chickens,, beef,
	pork, the sale of weaners (Piglets four to six weeks old), geese,
	turkeys, ducks, bales of hay, bags of grain, cream, potatoes,
	furnace wood, and butter, etc.  In addition, it ensured that the
	family had meat and potatoes for their own use.</p>
	<p lang="en-GB" align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<h1><b>Sheep</b></h1>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>We
	always kept a few sheep, perhaps a dozen or so – nor am I sure of
	the breed although I know they were white.  The sheep had their own
	shed at the top of the hill where we coasted.  It was easy to climb
	onto the roof of the sheep shed and jump off into the snow bank,
	which curled around it.  
	</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>Each
	spring there were new lambs, usually twins but sometimes only one;
	they always seemed sickly and some had to be nursed with a bottle. 
	Sometimes they were brought into the house for a few days.  Some
	died.  But all were cute.  In early summer the sheep had to be
	sheared.  Sheep shears were hand operated, very sharp and were
	hinged at one end not hinged in the middle like a pair of scissors. 
	I never sheared   sheep but I helped Norman on occasion.  
	</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>One
	put a few boards on top of sawhorses.  Sheep were caught and their
	front and hind legs were tied together.  Then they were put on the
	table and sheared.  Norm was pretty good at it although occasionally
	nicked the skin and drew blood.  Sometimes the sheep had ticks and
	had to be dusted or sprayed.  They sure looked funny with all the
	wool removed.  Shearing sheep was a dirty, smelly job partly because
	the wool was so oily.</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>I
	remember Norm bringing home half a dozen sheep in the old Model A. 
	He had removed the back seat and turned up the seat on the passenger
	side.</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>Also
	in the spring of the year, we docked the tails of the lambs. 
	Docking meant cutting off their tails to leave only a stub.  This
	was done with one chop with a sharp axe.  We had small cloth
	squares, perhaps a 4-inch square, and a bit of grease was put on the
	cloth and over the end of the stump.  This was used to keep the
	wound clean.

	</p>
	<h3>Cars</h3>
	<p lang="en-GB" align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p lang="en-GB" align="justify">Dad
	owned a Model T Ford; it had a soft top with curtains on the side. 
	Lillian thought it was purchased from  McLennan’s Garage in
	Chatham.  MacLennan's garage was located on the corner of the Park
	probably the site of MacCarthy's (and Flett's) garage in later
	years.  Grace was learning to drive at the time and the salesman
	took Grace for a drive in the car. 
	</p>
	<p lang="en-GB" align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify"><span lang="en-GB">Lillian
	remembered travelling with Dad in the Model T to Moncton to bring
	Grace and Gladys MacNaughton back from Business College.  Lil
	Cormier, a cousin, went with them.  On the way home, I think at
	Gilbert’s Corner, Dad upset the car.  Grace broke her wrist and
	Dad had some cuts and bruises.  Lillian also recalled that, on the
	same trip, they stopped in Rexton on the way home and had supper
	with a friend.  On the way home after supper, they encountered a car
	load of men who tried to run Dad off the road; Lillian thought that
	the men had been drinking and may have been rumrunners.  Dad pulled
	into a store and phoned the RCMP in Newcastle.  Lillian drove back
	as far as John W MacNaughton’s home in the police car.  She also
	recalls that there was a dance that night in the Little Branch
	School.  Even with a broken wrist, Grace loved to dance and went
	that night.  Venetia was also at that dance.</span></p>
	<p lang="en-GB" align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify"><span lang="en-GB">In
	the early 1930s, Dad bought a two-door Model A sedan.  Both Lillian
	and Walter remembered it being purchased from the Babineau sisters,
	the Babineau family operated the cinema in Chatham, and was
	purchased on the day Annie MacDougall died.  </span>Walter
	remembered working with Dad cutting wood up Bay du Vin River to earn
	money to buy one of the cars. 
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">Shown
	below  are the 1928 registrations for the Model T Ford and in 1938
	for the Model A. Ford  Thanks to Lillian (Glendenning) Murray for
	access to the original documents.</p>

	</p>
	<p>The
	gas tank for the Model T, was just in front of the windshield and
	gas flowed by gravity to the engine.  On very steep hills, the
	Tabusintac for example, the car had to be turned around and driven
	backward up the hill.   The Model A sat in the old wagon shed,
	presumably because of the recession.   Walter said that Dad allowed
	$2.00 worth of gas each week but I do not recall for what year.  Gas
	pumps of the day were pumped by hand to fill a chamber at the top of
	the pump.  The gas then flowed by gravity through the hose to the
	gas tank on a car.  I don’t think that Dad was<span lang="en-GB">
	a very good driver. Venetia recalled that Aunt Venetia came to New
	Brunswick, perhaps for Grace’s wedding.  Dad took Aunt Venetia for
	a drive to show her around.  (I think that I went along for the
	drive) On her return, Aunt Venetia said she now understood why Mum
	did not want to travel in the car when Dad was driving.</span></p>
	<p lang="en-GB" align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p lang="en-GB" align="justify">Dad
	would have earned good money when he worked in construction.  I
	vaguely recall seeing a pay envelope and thinking that it was good
	money for the times.  Apparently he left some money in a bank in the
	USA, perhaps Portland, and lost some money in the crash of 1929.</p>

	<p lang="en-GB" align="justify">Patricia
	Hubbard wrote the history of the Northumberland cooperative.  In it,

	a big man with tremendous capacity for hard work&quot;.</p>
	<p lang="en-GB" align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p lang="en-GB" align="justify">Dad
	had a team of oxen which he used around the farm.  Lillian remembers

	<p lang="en-GB" align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p lang="en-GB" align="justify">Dad

	<p lang="en-GB" align="justify">Elmer
	Glendenning was known as a hard worker. He built and repaired his
	own harness, re-soled the children’s shoes, and made axe handles.
	Even when he was not able to work, Brydone Weeks told that Dad had
	himself taken to the field in a wheelbarrow where he sharpened the
	scythes while the men were cutting marsh hay.  Dad suffered for a
	number of years with pernicious anaemia.  Walter remembers the wagon
	rack breaking one evening when coming from the woods with a load of
	wood.  Later he and Dad returned to the woods, unloaded the wood,
	cut poles, repaired the wagon rack, and returned home so that the
	wagon load of wood was ready to be taken to Loggieville the next
	day.  Part of the repair work was carried out by the light of a
	lantern.  Lillian remembers Dad up on the roof shingling at
	daybreak.

	<p lang="en-GB" align="justify">Ken
	recalls that Dad had cleared some land in the back field, behind
	where Eric Glendenning now lives.  He had requested a fire permit to
	burn brush.  Expecting it in the mail, he decided to go ahead and
	burn.  The permit did not arrive; the fire jumped the ditch and got
	into the woods.  Dad and others carried barrels of water on a truck
	wagon from the river to put out the fire.  John Fowlie, who was the
	local firewarden, called the RCMP because Dad was burning illegally.
	 Two RCMP officers arrived; one was Bedford Peters a first cousin of
	Dad’s and the other was Aubrey Falls.  On the way in to Black
	River, Bedford had stopped and picked up the required fire permit. 
	Lillian arrived home from the USA in the midst of all the commotion.</p>

	<p>Jean, Mrs Norman, Glendenning remembers her Uncle
	Allie MacDonald telling about working in the woods with Dad. 
	Apparently Dad lumbered Willard’s (Jean father) place the year he
	bought it.  Allie was on the other end of a crosscut saw with Dad. 
	Dad said, ”I don’t mind giving you a ride, little man, but
	please don’t drag your feet.”</p>

	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p><span lang="en-GB">Dad
	was a founding member of an Agricultural Society (#103) and was its
	Secretary Treasurer for fourteen years.  </span>An
	Agricultural Society, and there were many throughout the Province, 
	was like a Co-op.  Farmers banded together and bought seeds, lime
	and fertilizer, etc. in bulk and sold it to themselves.  Seems to me
	that they also handled some agricultural pesticides or herbicides. 
	Farmers were canvassed each winter; their needs aggregated and then
	orders were placed. Lime and fertilizer was ordered by the ton (by
	the boxcar) either loose or bagged.  It came to the station in
	Loggieville.  When it arrived, John, Walter, Ken and Norm would go
	to Loggieville and shovel the lime or fertilizer from the boxcar to
	the wagons for farmers who had bought it.  Later lime and fertilizer
	could be purchased either bagged or loose.</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>Dad
	kept the Agricultural shed.  The shed was well-built with a pitch
	roof, probably 10 to 12 ft wide and 20 to 24 feet long but that is
	only a guess.  It sat by the west side of the lane across from our
	back door.    I remember seeing the bags of timothy, alsike clover,
	red clover, alfalfa, etc.  As Secretary-Treasurer, he kept the
	books.  The only auditor I recall was Johnnie McKnight.  And I
	remember Johnnie coming to the house and going over the books with
	Dad.  When he finished, he inscribed the following: “Audited and
	found correct, John C. McKnight”.  
	</p>
	<p>Recently Arthur Mills, formerly from Hardwicke,
	sent me a statement of account sent to his father, Jasper Mills, by
	my father, Elmer Glendenning, for 1930 with the <b>Black River
	Agricultural Society No. 103 Dr. and Co-0perative Association.</b> 
	(I am not sure what the Dr. stands for.)”.  The statement dated
	Sept. 16<sup>th</sup> 1930 had the following entries:</p>

	<p>As a follow-up, I checked 2003 prices of these
	items in PEI.  Fertilizer, depending on the mix, is from $125-$300
	per ton; timothy seed  $1.17 lb; red clover $1.65 lb; and alsike
	clover is $1.31 lb.</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>After
	Dad died, Walter became Secretary Treasurer and moved the shed to
	his place.  I remember the men jacking up the shed and putting extra
	long bunks on the bobsleds to carry the weight of the shed.  Then
	one morning, after a light snowstorm, a team of horses was hitched
	to the bobsleds and the shed was taken to Walter’s.  When Walter
	left Black River, I believe that Harry Watling operated the “shed”.</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>Marjorie
	(Watling) Young told me that she
	went across the road to Aunt Jane’s every day.  Dad always wanted
	her to sit in to the table and eat.  Walter always gave her a
	whisker rub.  Mum always had cookies.  Maria Stone boarded at home
	for a while. She may have been a teacher.</p>

		was the best cook ever.  Having a big family to feed, bread to make
		almost every day, and in those days, a bread had to be set
		overnight, starting with a batter called sponge, in which the yeast
		was mixed into about a quart of flour and let rise.  Quick yeast
		wasn’t used until the war years in the forty’s.  That sure was
		an improvement, so much less time to make bread.  Many times Mum
		would cook hot biscuits and applesauce for breakfast along with
		porriage, fried potatoes, lots of fresh cream.  Mum’s specials
		were Yankee toast (bread fried in molasses) scallop potatoes, apple
		pie baked in a square pan and cream on top.  Do you remember when
		she would bake cinnamon rolls and put a sauce over it before they
		were put in the oven to bake,  How we all loved that for dessert.  
		Then there were cooked cranberries with thick cream on them and hot
		biscuits to eat with it”.  </b></i>

	had lived five years longer than they thought he would.  He died at

	GLENDENNING</b></h1>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>After
	28 years of marriage, Jane Elizabeth Jardine (Watling) became a
	widow in 1938; she was 48 at the time.  The two oldest daughters,
	Grace and Venetia, were married and living elsewhere; her daughter,
	Lillian, was living and working in the Boston area.  Elinor and the
	five boys, the youngest being eight years old, were living at home.</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p lang="en-GB" align="justify">The
	next decade, the wartime years, brought a number of significant
	changes to the community.  The commencement of classes in Bay du
	Vin, and the construction of the Miramichi Rural High School,
	allowed young people of the community to continue their schooling to
	the end of high school while continuing to live at home; before
	this, the nearest high school was in Loggieville, eleven miles away.
	 The looming war resulted in the construction of an airbase at
	Chatham, a radar station at St. Margaret’s, and a bombing range on
	the road to Loggieville.  These developments meant a significant
	growth of non-farm jobs for the community.  The outbreak of
	hostilities also soon resulted in sons, sons-in-law, neighbours,
	relatives and friends entering the armed forces.  The decade also
	brought improved roads, regular bus service to Chatham and electric
	lights.  By the end of the decade, Black River had moved from a
	barter to a cash economy.</p>
	<p lang="en-GB" align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p lang="en-GB" align="justify">Although
	her sons continued to operate the family farm for the next decade,
	the decade also brought significant changes to the family;  Walter
	finished building his house on the Dan MacLean property, married and
	moved out; Lillian returned to New Brunswick and married; Elinor
	attended high school in Bay du vin, Kenneth, Norman and Don attended
	the new Miramichi High School; Walter, Kenneth and Norman served in
	the armed forces; John, after operating the farm during the war,
	married, built a house and moved to the Bob MacLean property; Elinor
	married and moved out; Kenneth returned from military service,
	married and moved away; Don finished high school and entered
	teaching; Norman married and settled on the home place.    
	</p>
	<p lang="en-GB" align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p lang="en-GB" align="justify">Mother
	continued to be active in the community generally and encouraged her
	family and others to do the same.  She was especially active in her
	church, the Women’s Missionary Society, the Presbyterian League
	and the Women’s Institute.  She believed in education and
	supported the construction of a high school for the area; she also
	encouraged her family and others to continue their schooling. (It is
	interesting to note that the Miramichi Rural High School was the
	first rural high school in the Province; immediately following WW2,
	the number grew rapidly with, I believe, federal financial support,
	until there were approximately 50 rural high schools throughout the
	New Brunswick.)

</div>
<p lang="en-GB" style="page-break-before: always">Norman
and Jean married in 1951 and Mum continued to live with them until
she died in 1964. Mum died in the Miramichi Hospital of cancer of the
pancreas having been in the hospital only about two weeks.  
</p>
<p lang="en-GB" align="justify"><br />

</p>
<p lang="en-GB" align="justify">The
following vignettes are intended to round out the picture of Mother,
her interests, activities and passions:</p>
<p lang="en-GB" align="justify"><br />

</p>
<ul>
	<li><p lang="en-GB" align="justify" style="widows: 2; orphans: 2">
	While
	discussing VE Day with Vance MacNaughton in June of 1995 at the
	shopping mall in Douglastown, he told Ken and I about his memory of
	VE Day (May 8, 1944).  As readers will know, the Little Branch
	School was down the road and across the brook from home.  Vance was
	a student in the school at the time when, suddenly, there was a
	knock at the door and, without waiting for a response, the door flew
	open and Mum announced to teacher and students alike &quot;The War
	is over&quot;.  
	</p></li>
	<li><p lang="en-GB" align="justify" style="widows: 2; orphans: 2">
	Mother
	had no formal training as a nurse but made herself available and was
	frequently called upon by others in the community in time of need
	such as for a birth, sickness or death in a family.  
	</p></li>
	<li><p align="justify" style="orphans: 2; widows: 2">
	<span lang="en-GB">Mother
	always took the lead role in the washing of the wool and trading it
	for yarn.  </span>After
	the snow and ice disappeared but before the grass grew, it was
	necessary to wash the wool.  It was a major undertaking.  
	</p></li>
</ul>
<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 0.29in"><br />

</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 0.5in">In
preparation for washing, rainwater was saved in large tubs and
buckets.  Rainwater was used because it was softer than water from
the well thereby using less soap but more important, resulting in
cleaner wool; in addition, without electricity, water would have had
to be pumped by hand.  Also, a bench was set up in the front yard to
hold the tubs.  In addition, The bags of wool were opened and the
real dirty parts were snipped off and discarded.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in">The
water was heated on the kitchen stove, carried to the yard, and then
the wool was washed and rinsed several times.  Once Mum was satisfied
that the wool was clean, thin swatches were spread on the grass to
dry.  The clumps were small and kept thin so that they would dry
quickly.    The wool would be left over night, or perhaps over a
couple of nights, to dry then gathered up and bagged.  Leaving the
wool too many days spread out on the grass resulted in the wool
settling down into the grass and, therefore, being difficult to
gather and bag when dry.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in">The
bags of dry, clean wool were loaded into the Model A Ford and taken
to Brown’s Woolen Mills in Nelson where it would be converted into
yarn.  I was there only once but I remember the big machines and the
noise.  Brown’s had, I believe, the only woollen mill on the
Miramichi at that time.  Negations were based on the weight of the
wool.  One could (1) get one’s own yarn back after it was converted
into yarn by paying the cost of processing but that meant a return
trip to pick up your yarn.  (2) One could get an equal amount of
yarn, but not your own, on the day you took your wool to the mill
provided you paid for the processing.  What Mother usually did, in
effect, was to sell her wool to the mill, purchase the number of
skeins and colours of yarn she wanted, and pay the difference in
cash. 
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in">Mum
usually had more wool than she needed, so she sold some to neighbours
and, I think, she had some customers by mail.</p>
<p><br />

</p>
<ul>
	<li><p style="widows: 2; orphans: 2">Mother,
	like other mothers in the community, knitted all our socks, mitts
	and sometimes sweaters.  She could knit a pair of mitts or socks in
	a day and usually knitted while resting, visiting or talking with
	family in the evening.  She often knitted socks or mitts for
	relatives or friends as Christmas gifts.  The men wore heavy woollen
	sock both summer and winter; I cannot remember when I had my first
	pair of “store-bought” socks.</p></li>
	<li><p style="widows: 2; orphans: 2">Bread
	was a staple and a large family required many loaves of bread each
	week.  The recipe was mixed in a large, round blue-enamelled, bread
	pan.  A cake of Fleischmann’s yeast was “started” in a cup of
	warm water.  The dough was made into loaves, set in a warm place to
	rise, and then put in the oven to bake.  My recollection is that she
	would make 7 loaves at a time twice a week.  Often of an evening
	when Mother went off to a Missionary meeting, I was left to keep the
	fire going and bake the bread.</p></li>
	<li><p style="widows: 2; orphans: 2">Mother
	loved to have visitors.  There were a half-dozen at every meal and
	putting up a meal for 15 after church on Sunday, or any other day,
	did not faze her a bit or if it did, she did not let on.  I cannot
	ever even once remember her saying, I wish they hadn’t or wouldn’t
	come today.  Meals were not fancy but they were always tasty.  Of
	course, when the visitors were family, the daughters or
	daughters-in-law, pitched in to help.</p></li>
	<li><p style="widows: 2; orphans: 2">Oil
	lamps were tended early each day so that, when night fell, there was
	no scramble for a light.  We had three oil lamps plus, in later
	years, an Aladdin lamp.  Lamps were filled with kerosene, wicks were
	trimmed, globes were wiped first with an old newspaper to remove the
	soot, then washed, dried and replaced.  When finished, the kerosene
	lights were placed on a shelf beside the clock high on the kitchen
	wall.   The Aladdin lamp used gas, naphtha?, and did not require
	such daily care. 
	</p></li>
	<li><p style="widows: 2; orphans: 2">Securing
	food for the coming winter was a major concern in a household. 
	While Mother had no special role in the planting or harvesting, she
	played the major role in pressuring food for winter.  The first step
	was to have a good garden, which resulted in potatoes, carrots and
	turnips stored in bins in the basement.  Carrots were a bit more
	complex and were usually stored in sand in the basement.  Apples
	were stored in a cold bedroom, usually the large bedroom over the
	driveway.  Some preserves were put up – peaches, cucumber pickles,
	chow and mustard beans.  Several baskets of peaches were purchased
	and these were bottled along with some strawberries, blueberries and
	maybe even raspberries.  
	</p></li>
	<li><p style="widows: 2; orphans: 2">The
	advent of the home canner gave a new twist to preserving – that of
	canning.  Boxes of empty cans and covers were purchased, after
	sterilizing the cans, peas and beans blanched and packed into the
	cans.  The cans were then sealed and boiled for a couple of hours in
	a barrel or huge pot over an open fire.  Then they were cooled
	quickly, labelled and stored for the winter.  If the ends of cans
	did not snap back when cooled, those cans were considered unsafe and
	opened immediately</p></li>
