<div class="reader-summary">Email (January 5, 2008) from Irma Downing to Don seeking information about a Glendenning family in Chatham (1911 census: William, Ethel, Kenneth, Wyona, Marjorie, Lorne, Jean) and mentioning Glendennings in Big River, Bathurst. Irma is a former teacher (1969-1986, Salmon Beach to Caraquet, taught ESL) and discovers connection: her mother Alda Jane Knowles was named after &quot;Alda Jane &#x27;Maud&#x27; Glendenning&quot; (Don&#x27;s aunt), confirming Glendenning-Knowles family connections in the region. Demonstrates Don&#x27;s role as central researcher fielding inquiries about interconnected New Brunswick families.</div>

<p>I found this family of Glendennings in the Chatham area in the 1911 Census..Do you know anything about them?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Also there were Glendennings in the Big River Area of Bathurst..if fact Elmer Glendenning was married to Joy Glendenning..Joy's father was my father's first cousin..Very small world..</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>You said you were the youngest of 9 children..On the Chronicle, I have read notes on 3 of your siblings..very well presented.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Are you planning on doing this for all your family?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Is your Watling branch connected to the Watling families in the Bathurst area?</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>From working on practically all the known families in the New Bandon area, I learned a lot about them..everyone is interconnected..I am sure you have found the same thing in the Black River area..</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I, too, taught school for 17 years..I started in Salmon Beach..the green school, in 1969 and ended in Caraquet in 1986.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I began my teaching career teaching grades 4 &amp; 5 , then married and moved to Saint Leolin, near Grande Anse.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I was then accepted to teach English as a Second Language to Grade 10 - 12.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My first year was very difficult as I couldn't speak French and had no close contact with my students..the following year I started picking up the language and as they say the rest is History..I didn't retire from teaching I just stopped...to much paper work and the Government was reforming the education system which I wasn't OK with..</p>
<p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>My mother name is Alda Jane Knowles, she was named after Alda Jane "Maud" Glendenning..Sanford Cormier's mother and your aunt..again small world..this was the little link that lead me to believe the Glendennings and the Knowles families were connected..many time it seems..</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Well I am fighting a bad cold which has settled in my chest..I should see a Dr. to get a puffer..but I believe in letting the body heal itself..<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I will kee looking out for any tidbit I can find on our Harley's.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Regards</p>
