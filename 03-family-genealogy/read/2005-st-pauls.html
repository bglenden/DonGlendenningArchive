<p><b>Speaking Notes on the occasion of the75</b><b><sup>th</sup></b><b> Anniversary</b></p>
<p><b>July 24, 2005</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Congratulations - 	members and adherents of this congregation for seventy-five years of dedication and service</p>
<p>Thanks for the invitation to take part - Seventh-five years ago</p>
<p>first regular church service. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>I was here and let me see <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Edith, Marjorie, Ken, Norm, George, Marion, Blanche, others ?</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The Chatham Gazette on July 15, 1930 called this church building “a fine and beautiful edifice.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is a credit to any community.”</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The article went on to say:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b><i>“In these days when any kind of building may pass for a church, it can be truly said that the structure in Black River reflects the ideal ecclesiastical architecture for a small house of worship.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The church has evoked nothing but praise from all who have seen it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Great appreciation is expressed to all who have worked to make it what it is – to the building committee, to the carpenters in charge and others who o have laboured without stint.” <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></i></b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>And I would commend all who worked diligently since to maintain it.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>First some comments about the year 1930:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Black River, like the rest of Canada, was in recession.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There was little or no cash; it was a barter economy. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Families spent much effort just putting food on the table, planting, cultivating, harvesting, preserving and storing for the winter.</p>
<p>Telephone service had not yet arrived</p>
<p>Most travel was by horse and wagon or horse and sled;</p>
<p>There were a few cars but many were stored in barns for lack of funds to buy gas</p>
<p>Social gatherings were held at either the church or the school</p>
<p>The community hall was still in the discussion stage</p>
<p>$2.00 was an average wage, Walter received $1.50 a day for shingling, neighbours traded days for cutting wood and threshing, some equipment was owned jointly.</p>
<p>Dad sold 2x4 to the new hall for 25 cents each, a load of gravel cost $1.50 delivered.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Hired men received $.50 to $1.00 per day plus board.</p>
<p>Roads were built and maintained by hand or with horses; landowners were required to perform so many days of roadwork each year.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This was known as statute or stated labour.</p>
<p>Sadler’s sold long pants for a dollar a pair, McKendys sold 6 water glasses for 29 cents and fancy water pitchers for 45 cents; Rubenstein’s sold fresh country butter for 22 cents a pound</p>
<p>A subscription to the Gazette cost $2.00 per year</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>This was the setting in which a small band of members launched the building of a new church.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Construction was delayed the previous year because of severe fall weather.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Their faith was strong, they had the courage of their convictions; they would build themselves a place of worship.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And they did<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>- on land donated by Jack Gibson.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>By the summer of 1930 thanks to a combination of free and paid labour – and the benefit of a mortgage- a building, this building, was ready for service.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>On Friday, July 18, a meeting of the Presbytery was hosted by the new congregation. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The first service was held on Sunday, July 20 at 3:00 pm..<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is the first service that we commemorate today.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was a big event in the lives of the congregation. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>One can imagine folks from both sides of the river, from upper Black river to around the Branch, having early lunch, hitching their horses and heading for church dressed in their Sunday best.</p>
<p>Our family probably traveled in two wagons, Dad, Mother and the younger ones went ahead in the light wagon and Walter followed in the larger wagon with the rest of the family.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></p>
<p>On arrival at the church, they stopped by the front steps, families alighted, the men drove the horses around the church and hitched them to the fence along the upper line; there would be few cars in the yard</p>
<p>Dr. Squires from Chatham led the service, two baptisms were conducted - Burns Adams, son of George and Ida Adams and myself.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Burns died in 1934,</p>
<p>The service over, folks lingered to talk, then mounted their wagons and headed home satisfied that they now had their own place of worship which would be the center for their religious practices and as a source of Christian education for their children.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>On returning home, it was time to change clothes and do the chores.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>We all have memories of this church but not necessarily of those early days.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My memories include:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I probably could point out the pew used by each of the families when I attended this church.</p>
<p>Sunday School under the big tree in Aunt Kate and Uncle Jim’s yard,</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Searching through an old trunk for an appropriate reading for Young Peoples meeting</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Evening services with a gentle breeze coming through the open window and the sound of birds and crickets in the field outside.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Discussions on the way home about the sermon.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The hiss of the gaslights during an evening service</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Lanternslide shows by visiting missionaries (I am still not sure how the light for the projector was provided.)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Following one presentation, I recall, I was all ready to go the mission field in Formosa.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>And I would be remiss if I did not mention the early leadership, energy and dedication of Uncle Jim and Aunt Kate Watling.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Seventy-five years later we celebrate an accomplishment of our ancestors.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In that era, ones faith was central to ones life.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Our parents had the courage of their convictions.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They wanted a dedicated place of worship for themselves and for their families.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They acted on their Faith.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The sacrificed other things to make it happen. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I find that worthy of high praise. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Many here tonight, including myself, were shaped in part by our experiences in this church – and we are the better for it.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Again, I congratulate, commend and thank the congregation on this important milestone. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
