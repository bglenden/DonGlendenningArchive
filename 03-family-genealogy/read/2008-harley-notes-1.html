<p><b>HARLEY NOTES</b></p>
<p><b>January 1, 2008</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>I had a number of queries recently about my Harley connections and information about the Harley Family.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I used the queries as an excuse to review my notes and files.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Here are a few notes that do not seem to fit into the actual family tree but may be of interest:</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>My connection to the Harleys is through my Great Grandmother, Margaret Harley who married John Glendinning</b></p>
<p><b>While all evidence points to my Great Grandmother being a daughter of William and Ann (Bidders) Harley, I do not have, nor have I seen actual proof of, the relationship. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b>Margaret’s siblings are William, John, Elizabeth and Mary Anne</b></p>
<p><b>The Spring 2004 Issue of Generations, Journal of NB Genealogical Society, carried an item from the obituary of John Harley taken from the Union Advocate of Sept 29, 1875.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I can send it to you if you would like to see it.</b></p>
<p><b>According to my information, our Harleys came to Canada in the following order:<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>William in 1820, Mary Ann in 1822 and John in 1823; I do not know the dates of arrival of Elizabeth and Margaret.</b></p>
<p><b>Books of interest:<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Louise Manny<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Ships of the Miramichi” and Margaret Hunter “Pioneer Settlers of the Bay Chaleur” in 1978; I have not seen the first one but have a copy of the second.</b></p>
<p><b>Burton Glendenning, a descendent of Margaret Harley and John Glendinning, was NB Archivist and wrote a book, perhaps a thesis for a degree, on the Burchills of the Miramichi.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I have not seen the book.</b></p>
<p><b>I note the possibility that Hurley and Harley may be the same family; I did not encounter that but understand that they have the same roots.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Interesting to note in Heather’s list of Hurleys, that a John Hurley married Elizabeth Burchill in 1841.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Our John Harley and George Burchill were partners in shipbuilding on the Miramichi; they probably came from the same place.</b></p>
<p><b>As some of you know, I publish a Family Chronicle” ( HYPERLINK "http://www.glendenning.net/don" </b><span><b>www.glendenning.net/don</b></span><b>)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This started as a way to pass along family information to my siblings – I am the youngest of nine.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Later I began to include information about the community where I was raised, Black River Bridge, New Brunswick, about 15 miles east of what was Chatham and now is Miramichi City.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Some time ago<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I decided to devote an issue of the family Chronicle to each of my siblings.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The one on myself is Issue No. 18, May 6, 2006.</b></p>
<p><b>Harley information may be found in the following Family Chronicles: 1, 4, 125, 134 and 136 ( HYPERLINK "http://www.glendenning.net/don" </b><span><b>www.glendenning.net/don</b></span><b>)</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>In preparing these notes, I simply reviewed the notes I have in my file.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I know that there are others who have dome much more than I<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>but am glad to share anything I have that others may find useful.</b></p>
