<p>MOTHERS</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The lamp is lit in the window</p>
<p>And back of it is her chair</p>
<p>And as I look across, it seems</p>
<p>She surely must be there.</p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>I picture too her little room</p>
<p>So very neat and snug</p>
<p>Her very fingers made it so</p>
<p>Oh yes, the braided rug.</p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>The cushion on her rocking chair,</p>
<p>The quilt upon her bed,</p>
<p>Her dresser with the many things</p>
<p>Her very hands had spread.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I pull apart the curtains</p>
<p>Her mark again I see</p>
<p>Her dresses hung up neatly</p>
<p>Yes, as neatly as can be.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>And as I sit and ponder</p>
<p>A picture there I see</p>
<p>It’s of my Mother’s Mother</p>
<p>Whose room it used to be</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Yes, patient, tireless Mother</p>
<p>Who gave to their world their best</p>
<p>Your children call you blessed</p>
<p>God’s love made manifest.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>And when my work on earth is done</p>
<p>And I have crossed the Bar</p>
<p>God grant that I may enter in</p>
<p>Where those dear Mothers are.</p>

<p>Family members remembered seeing some of my Mother’s poetry but none of it survived.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>At a family reunion a few years ago, Ruth (MacNaughton) Lewis mentioned having a poem written by my mother and, subsequently, she sent the above poem to me.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This poem was written about a month after her mother died.</p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>

<p><b>Watling Roots</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>My information about the earliest Watlings was the Jubal Watling was married to Susan Leach, that he came from Suffolk, England, was married in 1814, had a son, Jubal who was born about 1823.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>(The census of 1851 shows Jubal as age 28)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Thanks to Tina (Watling) Newton, we have a bit more factual information about the Watlings. Based on the above and additional information gathered from the Roger Watling website, here are my conclusions.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Jubal Watling, born in 1823 in Syleham, Suffolk, England, He was the son of Jubal Watling and Susan Leach. </p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Jubal Watling married Susan Leach in Metfield, Suffolk County, England on November 14, 1814.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They appear to have moved to Syleham, Suffolk County, England where their son, Jubal was baptized on August 17, 1823.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I believe that Jubal and Susan stayed in England, although I do not know for sure.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A note in Kenneth Watling’s database says that Jubal migrated to the USA -<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>we do not know the year.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Family lore says that Jubal came to Black River via Cape Breton and maybe PEI.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Siblings of Jubal who came to or lived in Black River include William who married Mary MacNaughton, Emma who married William Eddy, Mary Ann who married William Maxwell, and George who lived in the USA</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Jubal Watling<b> <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b> (F4243) petitioned for 50 acres of land situate as follows: on the South side of Black River adjoining south of William McBeath’s meadow<span> </span>lot and east of a lot applied for by John Edge.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The petition is dated at Chatham on April 9, 1851 and includes his signature.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The property was vacant, surveyed but without improvements.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Other handwritten notes on the page are confusing in that they show apparent approval on May 21/1851 and Auction, August 51".<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They are signed by Peters, the Deputy Surveyor.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>No lot number is given but records show that a William MacBeath owned property in the area.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I believe that this was the Jubal Watling married to Christina MacNaughton.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This land was probably not in the Meadows.</p>
<p><span></span><br></p>
<p>Children of Jubal and Christina (MacNaughton) Watling were:</p>
<p>Donald</p>
<p>Catherine (Kate)</p>
<p>Jubal, 1846-1915 married Grace MacDonald</p>
<p>Alexander (Sandy)</p>
<p>Susan</p>
<p>Malcolm</p>
<p>William</p>
<p><span></span><br></p>
<p><span></span><br></p>
<p>On April 20, 1881, Lot No. 30, consisting of 100 acres in the Meadows was granted to <b>Jubal Watling</b>.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This matches the location where Mum was born.<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>It is likely that this is the Jubal Watling married to Grace MacDonald – my grandparents.</p>
<p>The New Brunswick Crown Lands Grant Index records of grant of 100 acres located at A30 BL. 15 SE SD Black River, Glenelg Parish Northumberland County to Jubal Watling, Jr. on April 20, 1884. (Recorded in vol. 105, No.18287)</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Lot #30, granted to Jubal Watling, is located in an area known as the Meadows - a name that has long since disappeared.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The Post Office, however, would have been Black River.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The Meadows are found a mile or two west of Route 11 on the south side of the upper reaches of the Black River.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There was, I believe, a road along the south side of the Black River, however, in my time, access was from a road along the north side of the river and across MacBeath’s Bridge.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Buildings on the property have long since disappeared although Ken remembers visiting the property once and I think that I was there once picking blueberries.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Apparently a mound for the old root cellar still could be seen. The old property has reverted to forest and the community has disappeared.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The forests have now reclaimed whatever fields were cleared. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><b> <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><span></span><br></p>
<p>Neighbours, according to the original land grants, would have been (starting at Route 11 on the south side of the river and moving west) with the date the land was granted:</p>

<p>I would be interested to hear from any readers to see if this matches their information.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>With this new starting point, I hope to do some additional searching.</p>

<p><b>Wausau, Wisconsin</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>While traveling recently, I met a woman who had taught for a number of years at Wausau, Wisconsin.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My Dad worked there in 1910.</p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Glendinning</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>While in Victoria, earlier this year, I purchased a book called Glendinning by Pamela Ferguson.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is a story about a young boy who immigrated to the USA in the early 1900’s.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He started out as a shoe shine boy but eventually became a rum runner during prohibition but eventually became legitimate through the purchase of a company called Glendinning</p>
