<div class="reader-summary">A concise genealogical summary (titled &quot;Meadows to Little Branch&quot;) documenting the Watling family migration and property succession. Details Jubal Watling Sr.&#x27;s 1814 marriage to Susan Leach in England; the immigration of five children to Canada; Jubal Jr.&#x27;s 1851 land petition and 1881 grant of Lot #30 (100 acres) in the Meadows where Don&#x27;s mother was born; Grace MacDonald&#x27;s 1874 marriage to Jubal Jr.; their move to Little Branch after 1901; Alexander MacDonald&#x27;s original 1812 grant and property division between his son John and daughter Jessie; and the November 1901 agreement where Jubal and Grace took over John&#x27;s Little Branch property to care for elderly Elspeth MacDonald and her son James. Notes Jubal Jr.&#x27;s death on February 16, 1915, and Uncle Jim&#x27;s return from Portland to manage the farm.</div>

<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>Jubal Watling married a Susan Leach in Metfield, Suffolk County, England on November 14, 1814 and moved to Syleham, Suffolk County, England where their son, Jubal, was baptized on August 17, 1823.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They likely stayed in England, however, the following children came to Canada:</p>
<p>Jubal who married Christina MacNaughton</p>
<p>William who married Mary MacNaughton</p>
<p>Mary Ann who married William Maxwell</p>
<p>George who moved to the USA</p>
<p>Emma who married William Eddy</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Jubal Watling petitioned for land (F4243) on the south side of Black River on April 9, 1851, presumably this is the Jubal who married Christina MacNaughton.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They also had a son, Jubal.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Alexander MacDonald was granted Lot #2 on the Little Black River on June 2, 1812.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Half the property passed to his son, John, (where Uncle Jim Watling lived) and the other half passed to his daughter, Jessie.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My father bought the Jessie MacDonald property on July 21, 1914.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Grace, the daughter of John and Elspeth (Jardine) Watling married Jubal Watling on Dec 22, 1874 and, moved to Lot #30 in The Meadows.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>(The Meadows has long since been reclaimed by the forests.)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>All of their children were born there.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I believe that the elder Jubal died in 1900 and his wife, Christina died in 1901; Grace’s father, John MacDonald also died in 1900.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Graces mother was not well<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>(She died of “debility” in 1907) and Grace’s brother, James, was living at home but was not able to look after the farm. An agreement was struck late in 1901 for Elspeth MacDonald and her son, James, to turn over the property at Little Branch to Grace and Jubal.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In return, Grace and Jubal, and their sons, agreed to “keep, support, maintain and provide the said James J. MacDonald and his mother, Mrs. John D. MacDonald, each of them and the survivor of them during the respective terms of their natural lives with good and sufficient house, roof, meat, drink, washing, clothing, bedding, fire, light, medicine, medical attendance, personal expenses and all such necessaries as persons of their ages and conditions in life usually require and are accustomed to.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>agreement was also signed by all of the sons.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>My Grandfather, Jubal, died on February 16, 1915 and Uncle Jim came home from Portland to take over the farm and look after his mother.</p>
