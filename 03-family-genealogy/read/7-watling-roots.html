<p>To the extent
known, this section deals with actual ancestral families and their
locations.  The nature and extent of information for each family or
location varies, reflecting the extent of my search rather that
available information.  In no way should this section be considered a
complete family history.</p>
<p><br />

</p>
<p>While we usually
carry the name of the male side of our ancestral family, in fact,
each person is an equal descendant of many other families as well. 
In the writer’s case, he is directly descended on his maternal side
from families named Watling, Leech, MacNaughton, MacDonald, McAskill
and Jardine.  These families reflect Highland and Lowland Scottish
roots.  Of my maternal Great Grandparents, all were Scots except two.
 
</p>
<p><br />

</p>
<p>The Canadian roots
of my maternal ancestors reside in the community where I was born,
Black River, New Brunswick – a community some 10 miles south and
east of Chatham.

<p align="left"><b>BLACK RIVER CONNECTIONS</b></p>
<p align="justify"><br />

</p>
<p align="justify"><br />

</p>
<p align="justify">A.
W. MacDougall says that the name Black River, in the MicMac language
is <i>Mat-quan-ti-gook</i>
- a term intended to describe its waters.    MacDougall describes at
least one lot, at McDougall's Point near the mouth of the river,
which was granted to Delesderniere and Marsten prior to 1784.  United
Empire Loyalists came to Black River between 1785 and 1795. 
Following this, there arrived mostly people from Scotland,
highlanders and lowlanders alike, including MacDonalds (McDonalds),
MacNaughtons, McBeaths and MacLeans.  Many came directly from
Scotland while others are thought to have come to the Miramichi via
Cape Breton, Prince Edward Island, or other Maritime ports.</p>
<p align="justify"><br />

</p>
<p align="justify">The
Black River flows from west to east and empties into Bay du Vin,
which is part of the Miramichi River.  By 1800, grants had been made
to settlers along the shores from Hexham east.  In 1812, there was a
major push to settle the Black River including the Little Black River
now known as the Little Branch.  Settlements on the upper reaches of
the Black River came a decade later and the Meadows closer to mid-
century.  Some specific settlement dates are found later in this
chapter.</p>

</p>
<p align="justify"><br />

</p>
<p align="justify"><b>Transportation</b></p>
<p align="justify"><br />

</p>
<p align="justify">Transportation
between settlements was mainly by boat hence the fact that initial
settlements were along rivers and shores.  The dates on which grants
were made also reflect the fact that, in the case of Black River,
settlement proceeded up the river from its mouth. Adjacent lands
along at Hexham and in Miramichi (Bayside) were granted in the 1780's
and 1790's; settlers began to spread up the Black River, at least
along the south side, after the turn of the century.   Initially
blazed paths, and eventually roads were made between communities. 
Elsewhere, I quoted my Great Grandmother’s sister, Mary Anne
Harley, about her walk from Pokemouche through the woods to
Newcastle.</p>
<p align="justify"><br />

</p>
<p align="justify">Helena
(Smith) Kingston remembered her father, or was it her grandfather,
traveling from Bayside to Loggieville by small boat to pick up
supplies.  Later, commercial boats brought supplies from Loggieville
dropping them off at various locations along the coast often taking
fish on the return trip.</p>
<p align="justify"><br />

</p>
<p align="justify">According
to the History of Bay du Vin, 25 pounds Sterling was appropriated in
1819 to develop a road from Black River to Bay du Vin.  In 1824, John
Bailey Williston was given a sum of money to build to a width of 20
feet half the road from Bay du Vin to Black River.</p>
<p align="justify"><br />

</p>
<p align="justify">Even
when I was a youngster, I remember someone pointing out the “bark
road” which by then was only an overgrown road where it crossed our
property but could be more clearly seen and perhaps even used where
it crossed the McKnight Road.  The Bark Road was used in winter to
haul bark from the Black River area to be used in both Chatham and
Newcastle during the shipbuilding era.  It likely started somewhere
between Black River and Bay du Vin, crossed woodland properties in
the Branch and Black River, crossed the river, travelled along the A
short cut towards Point Aux Carr then turned west, crossed the Napan
road and eventually ended up at Chatham or Newcastle.</p>
<p align="justify"><br />

</p>
<p align="justify"><br />

</p>
<p align="justify"><b>The
first Tasks</b></p>
<p align="justify"><br />

</p>
<p align="justify">On
arrival, an immigrant would seek out a piece of land to make a home. 
The land was heavily forested and the first task would be to make a
clearing and prepare lodging for the coming winter, Homes were made
of logs cut on the property by hand; crevices between the logs were
stuffed with moss to keep out the cold and snow.  Logs not needed
were used for firewood; burned the remaining as brush and the first
seeds, wheat, oats, potatoes and garden vegetables were planted and
harvested among the stumps - again by hand.  A root cellar kept
vegetables from freezing during the long winters.</p>
<p align="justify" style="widows: 2; orphans: 2"><br />

</p>
<p align="justify" style="widows: 2; orphans: 2"><b>Schools</b></p>
<p align="justify" style="widows: 2; orphans: 2"><br />

</p>
<p align="justify" style="widows: 2; orphans: 2">Most
of the early settlers in Black River spoke Gaelic.  Based on the work
of A. W. McDougall, the first instruction in Black River was provided
in a barn belonging to Archibald Cameron, Sr.  Following this,
teachers provided instruction in their own homes.  In 1825, residents
petitioned for the erection of a school, which was erected across the
road from the Richard Godfrey residence (Until a few years ago, the
residence of John Godfrey); this would be just east of the lane
leading to St. Stephen’s church. This building seems to have served
all of Black River and as far east as Bay du Vin.  About 1845, the
district was divided with one school being build at Middle Black
River and another at Bayside (now Miramichi).  A few years later a
school was erected at Little Branch; shortly thereafter, the school
burned but was soon replaced.  I have no information on dates for the
first school in Upper Black River but believe that the first school
was east of Route 11.</p>
<p align="justify" style="widows: 2; orphans: 2"><br />

</p>
<p align="justify" style="widows: 2; orphans: 2">About
1937, the Rev. Douglas Smith, Rector at St. John’s Anglican Church
in Bay du Vin provided tutoring in the Rectory to high school
students in the area; numbers grew including students from Black
River.  Teachers were hired and classes were moved to the church
hall.  In January 1940, the Miramichi Rural High School opened at
Miramichi (Bayside) with 67 students enrolled.</p>

<h3>Mills 
</h3>
<p align="justify" style="widows: 2; orphans: 2"><br />

</p>
<p>The History of Bay du Vin records a
sawmill in Bay du Vin operated by Ortho Robichaud in 1789.  The Bay
du Vin history also reports the following taken from the Gleaner in
1833.</p>
<p><br />

</p>
<p><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><i>Mr.
George Fowlie erected a gristmill on the Little Black River, which
commenced grinding last week.  We have seen some bread made of the
flour manufactured at this mill and it was of superior quality.  It
has a never failing stream of water and will be a great accommodation
to the inhabitants of Bay du Vin and adjoining settlements where such
an establishment was much wanted.”  The Fowlie mill was burned and
rebuilt twice.</i></p>

</p>
<p align="justify" style="widows: 2; orphans: 2"><b>Churches</b></p>
<p align="justify" style="widows: 2; orphans: 2"><br />

</p>
<p align="justify" style="widows: 2; orphans: 2">According
to A. W. McDougall, most of the first settlers were Presbyterian and
would have been served by an itinerant ministers and missionaries. 
The first church, thought to be Presbyterian but used by all
Protestants in the area, was built in Bay du Vin in 1812.  In 1818
the people of Bay du Vin, Burnt Church and Tabusintac petitioned for
a minister to serve the three charges.</p>
<p align="justify" style="widows: 2; orphans: 2"><br />

</p>
<p align="justify" style="widows: 2; orphans: 2">The
people of Black River decided to build their own church and, on
November 20, 1836, St. Stephens Presbyterian Church was officially
opened.  The first building, I believe was erected in what now serves
as part of the cemetery. The church became dilapidated and, rather
than undertake repairs, a new building, the present St. Stephens
Church (at that time Presbyterian) was opened on December 30, 1906.</p>
<p align="justify" style="widows: 2; orphans: 2"><br />

</p>
<p align="justify" style="widows: 2; orphans: 2">As
a result of the creation of the United Church of Canada in 1925,
members who wished to continue in the Presbyterian faith found
themselves without a building.  For a few years they met in member’s
homes or in schools.  In 1930, St. Paul’s Presbyterian Church was
officially opened; St. Stephens continues to serve the community as
St. Stephens United Church.

<p><br />

</p>
<p><br />

</p>
<p>The
Gaelic spelling of MacDonald, meaning the son of Donald, is Mac
Dhomhnuill.  – but there were many donalds.  The Macdonalds were a
very large clan having taken many septs under their wing.</p>
<p><br />

</p>
<p>Alexander
MacDonald was a native of the Parish of Assynt in Rosshire, Scotland.
 That area of northwest Scotland is hilly and rocky with many inlets
and streams with little land suitable for cultivation; the county
also includes many islands</p>

<h2>Believed
to be Alexander and Grace (MacAskill) MacDonald</h2>
<p align="center"><br />

</p>
<p>My
Great Great Grandfather, Alexander MacDonald married Grace MacAskill
(I believe a relative of the giant Mac Askill of Cape Breton) and was
said to have actually come to the Miramichi by way of Cape Breton. 
George Loggie said that Alexander MacDonald spent the first winter in
Point Aux Carr after coming from Cape Breton</p>
<p align="justify">In
fact, some suggest that they were married in Cape Breton.  Their
children include:</p>
<p align="justify"><br />

</p>
<p align="justify">Kenneth		(1805-1837)</p>
<p align="justify">Annabel		(1806?-	)</p>
<p align="justify">Hugh

<p align="justify" style="page-break-after: avoid">Isabella

<p align="justify">Margaret		(1815-1900)		married
William Godfrey		(825-1904)</p>
<p align="justify">John			(1817

<p align="justify">Mary			(1821-1885)

<p align="justify">Jessie			(1823-1912)</p>
<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 2in"><br />

</p>
<p align="justify">The
original MacDonald home, I believe, was close to the river in the
field just above where Norman Glendenning now lives.  There was an
old apple orchard there as well as a depression in the ground, which
we always thought was the old cellar.  Teddy Fowlie once said that
his father, Bill Fowlie, remembered the old homestead in that
location; other4s remembered a barn.  Lillian (Glendenning) Weeks
remembered a pile of lumber in that area that she thinks was the
remnants of the old home.  I remember a pump in the field on Uncle
Jim’s property, not far from the orchard, and wonder if it may have
been part of the original Macdonald homestead.  In any case, the land
sloped from there to the river making easy access by boat.

	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>According
	to the “<u>Jardines
	of Atlantic Canada”</u>,
	is of French origin meaning “a dweller at or near a garden.  A
	Jardine fought with William the Conqueror at the Battle of Hastings
	in 1066; it is assumed therefore that the Jardines came from
	Normandy with William.  We do not know for certain if the Jardines
	in Scotland found their way north from England or if they came as
	part of another wave of conquerors from Normandy a few years later,
	however, the first written record of the name of Jardine in Scotland
	was in 1150.</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>The
	Jardines, as with the Glendennings, were Border people.  That is,
	they lived in Dumfriesshire and within 30 to 40 miles of the Border,
	and even closer to the birthplace of my Great Grandfather, John
	Glendinning at Callister Hall not far from Lockerbie.</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>The
	earliest reference to Jardines in my family is Joseph Jardine, born
	in 1767 in Tundergarth, Dumfriesshire, Scotland in 1767.  He married
	Janet Kerr, born in 1772 in Loveland, Scotland and they married on
	November 16, 1792.  It is believed that some of the children were
	born in Scotland, however, Joseph was granted land in Napan on
	February 27, 1827.  Joseph, my GGG Grandfather, died in Napan in
	1849 and Janet in 1860.  Their children include:</p>

	<p><b>1	Origin
	of Name</b></p>
	<p style="margin-left: -0.06in"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="margin-left: -0.06in">The
	first record of the name was found in Sussex, England somewhere
	between London and Dover.  It is likely that the name arises from
	Wartling which was a hamlet in the area but others believe that it
	was associated with Watling Road, the great Roman Road, which
	started near Dover, passed through Canterbury, turned north at
	London and went as far as St Albans     It is thought, furthermore,
	that the Watlings were Vikings who landed in Northern Scotland in
	870 AD, invaded northern France in 910 AD and then came to England
	with William the Conqueror in 1066.  The name is found in the
	Domesday Book which was a census taken in England in 1086.</p>
	<p style="margin-left: -0.06in"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="margin-left: -0.06in">By
	the time of Richard 1 the Watling name had spread north to
	Watlingford in Oxfordshire, Watlington in Norfolk, Essex and
	Hertfordshire.  Many Norman families moved north to Scotland in the
	12<sup>th</sup>
	century and this might have included some Watlings.</p>
	<p style="margin-left: -0.06in"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="margin-left: -0.06in">Watling
	is thought to share the same roots as Whatling, Watlington,
	Watlingtone, Whatlington, Whatlingtone, Wadling, and Wadlingdon. 
	Over time, the name spread into the northern parts of England and to
	Scotland as well.</p>
	<p style="margin-left: -0.06in"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">Kinsmen
	of the family Watling who came to North America include Ffrances
	Watling who settled in Virginia in 1660, John Watling who landed in
	America in 1753, James Watling settled in Philadelphia in 1842 and
	Mary Watlington who settled in Antigua in 1679.  Some Watlings moved
	to Canada after the American Revolution.  Thomas
	Watling was banished to Australia for forgery in 1792; Francis
	Watling settled in Virginia in 1660, John Watling landed in America
	in 1753 and Mary Watlington settled in Antigua in 1759.</p>

	<p style="margin-left: -0.06in">The
	Roger Watling Website includes the following comments about the
	origin of the Watlings:</p>
	<p style="margin-left: -0.06in"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="margin-left: 0.5in">“<i>In
	the 5</i><sup><i>th</i></sup><i>/6</i><sup><i>th</i></sup><i>
	century a band of people crossed the North Sea from Europe to the
	British Isles, we do not know if it was one or more boats, but as a
	yachtsman sailing these waters I would suppose the latter, there
	being safety in numbers.  They knew where they were going as trading
	was and had taken place long before, also they would have had oral
	stories from their forebearers who might have served in the Roman
	Legions, without a shred of evidence I like to think that they were
	Angles, or possibly Jute in origin rather than Saxon.  The leader of
	this band was WACEAL, and those with him of the same clan, tribe or
	group were the Waceal – ingas.  Ingas was not the son of as in the
	Scottish Watson, but meaning people of or followers of Waceal, so
	members of this group would be referred to as Wacelaingas.  As time
	past the name began to change from, the vowels hardening, or
	softening, plus the input of people from other tongues and one form
	was Waselin.  The earliest records I have are for Norfolk 1086, the
	DOOM’D DAY BOOK.  In this book is recorded the Manor in the Half
	Hudred Diss, today scholars call it a lost Manor as its whereabouts
	are unknown.  (I have my own theory, but that is another story)  The
	Manor of Watlingeseta it states was held by the king (William in
	1086, and before 1066 Edward the Confessor).  Also recorded in the
	book is Wazalin who held land in Weeting, Norfolk, one of the few
	Anglo Saxons still holding land after William the Bastard and his
	bunch of land grabbing thugs won the Battle of Hastings.  Watling
	Street was built by the Romans during their occupation and the name
	came after the Roman period, the present day town of St. Albans was
	originally Watlingcaster, but after the martyrdom of St. Alban the
	name changed, it can be supposed that the Wacealingas lived there.”</i></p>

	Street</b></p>
	<p style="margin-left: -0.06in"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="margin-left: -0.06in">Watling
	Street was a major Roman Road built by the Romans after they invaded
	Britain in 55 BC.  It started at Reculver, near Dover, passing
	through Canterbury (where a street sign bears the name) and on to
	London and points north.  From London, Watling Road runs north and
	west passing through St. Albans  (ancient Verulamium) a distance of
	about 200 km.  An Internet source says that Watling Road ran from
	Dover to North Wales.</p>

	<p>I

	Dumfries, Scotland, transported for forging notes on the Bank of
	Scotland; Watling was a landscape painter who arrived in Australia
	in 1792.   Watling is quoted a number of times on the barrenness of

	in honour of Captain George Watling a famous buccaneer and pirate. 
	(It was renamed in 1926).  He was also known as the “pious pirate”
	because he would not allow his crew to play cards or indulge in
	piracy on the Sabbath.  The name Watling appears frequently in
	literature about the Bahamas.  There may have also been a pirate
	named John Watling.  I am sure that neither of these were part of

	time of the 1841 census.  Lot 52 is at the Eastern end of PEI near
	but not including Montague and Cardigan.</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>According to the
	1841 census, Jubal Watling was between 45 and 60 years of age, head
	of the family, his trade or occupation was that of a mason, he had
	100 acres of land but one cannot tell if he rented or owned the
	land.  The household consisted of Jubal as head, one female between
	the ages of 45 and 60 presumably his wife, and 4 males under the age
	of 16.  Four members of the household were born in England and two
	were natives of the Island.</p>

	<p>The

	Metfield, Suffolk County, England on November 14, 1814.  Later they
	appear to have moved to Syleham, Suffolk County, England where their
	son, Jubal was baptized on August 17, 1823.  I believe that Jubal
	and Susan stayed in England, although I do not know for sure.  A
	note in Kenneth Watling’s database says that Jubal Jr. migrated to
	the USA -  we do not know the year.</p>
	<p style="margin-left: -0.06in"><br />

	</p>
	<p>Jubal
	Watling married Susan Leach in Metfield, Suffolk County, England on
	November 14, 1814.  In 1823, they were in Syleham, Suffolk County,
	England where their son, Jubal was baptized on August 17, 1823.  I
	found no evidence of Jubal and Susan coming to Canada, although it
	is possible.  A note in Kenneth Watling’s database says that Jubal
	migrated to the USA -  we do not know the year.  From my research, I
	believe that to be the Jubal who married Christina MacNaughton.  
	</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>Family
	lore says that Jubal came to Black River via Cape Breton and maybe
	PEI; that is certainly possible.  My search of PEI archives revealed
	a number of Watlings, including a Jubal, but the names, dates and
	marriage information did not match that of the Black River Watlings.

	<p>On April 20, 1881,
	Lot No. 30, consisting of 100 acres in the Meadows was granted to
	<b>Jubal Watling</b>.
	 This matches the location where Mum was born.    It is likely that
	this is the Jubal Watling married to Grace MacDonald – my
	grandparents.</p>

	Northumberland County to Jubal Watling, Jr. on April 20, 1884.

	<p align="justify"><span lang="en-GB">Lot
	#30, granted to Jubal Watling, is located in an area known as the
	Meadows - a name that has long since disappeared.  The Post Office,
	however, would have been Black River.  The Meadows are found a mile
	or two west of Route 11 on the south side of the upper reaches of
	the Black River.  There was, I believe, a road along the south side
	of the Black River, however, in my time, access was from a road
	along the north side of the river and across MacBeath’s Bridge. 
	Buildings on the property have long since disappeared although Ken
	remembers visiting the property once and I think that I was there
	once picking blueberries.  Apparently a mound for the old root
	cellar still could be seen. The old property has reverted to forest
	and the community has disappeared.  The forests have now reclaimed
	whatever fields were cleared.  </span><span lang="en-GB"><b>

	<p>My
	Grandfather, Jubal Watling, lived at the Meadows; he married Grace
	MacDonald who lived at Little Branch – where Neil Watling now
	lives.  Grandmother’s father, John, died in 1900, I think, and her
	mother, Elspeth, was not well.  In addition, James, Grandmother’s
	brother had inherited the farm when his father died, was not
	married, was living at home but was not able to operate the farm. 
	As best I can interpret, the land did not include the Jessie
	McDonald property where Norman Glendenning now lives.</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>On
	November 13, 1901, James entered into an agreement with his sister,
	Grace and her husband, Jubal.  As parties to the agreement also were
	Jubal and Grace’s four sons, George, John, James and Ernest.  A
	copy of this agreement can be found in the Northumberland County
	Registrar’s office.  
	</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>All
	the land and buildings are to be turned over to the Watlings.  In
	return, the Watlings will “keep support, maintain and provide the
	said James J. McDonald and his mother, Mrs. John D. McDonald, each
	of them and the survivor of them during the respective terms of
	their natural lives with good and sufficient house, room, meat,
	drink, washing, clothing, bedding, fire, light, medicine, medical
	attendance, personal expenses and all such necessaries as persons of
	their ages and conditions in life usually require and are accustomed
	to.”  The Watlings were also to provide a “decent Christian
	burial” paying all funeral expenses.</p>
