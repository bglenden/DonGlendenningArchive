<div class="reader-summary">Don&#x27;s 2022 Christmas letter reflecting on nostalgia for his mother and the importance of Christmas in his family&#x27;s history. He recalls his parents&#x27; moves through Wisconsin, Texas, Alabama, Tennessee, New Hampshire, Connecticut, Maine during their early married years. Don reports having a light case of COVID while Carol remained unaffected. He recounts Brian&#x27;s retirement and new travels (including Egypt and Jordan), Janet&#x27;s visits to Washington and Middle East, and family time at the Orwell Bay cottage. Don mentions PEI&#x27;s September hurricane, which left them without electricity for seven days and damaged trees on their property. He remains engaged with retired friends&#x27; coffees, education work, and family tree projects. Handwritten by Don.</div>

<p><b><i>Christmas Greetings</i></b></p>
<p><b><i><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>from Carol and Don</i></b></p>
<p><b><i>Christmas 2022</i></b><b><i></i></b></p>
<p><b><i>_____________________________________________________________________________________________</i></b><b><i></i></b></p>
<p><span>.</span><b><i>GREETINGS ACROSS THE MILES:</i></b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>‘Tis that time of year again.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>We are looking forward to Christmas 2022. Beautiful fall weather, long evenings, occasionally a lighted fireplace and great memories of family and friends. What a great time of year.</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>I also think of my Mother and how she treasured this time of year and the Christmas cards and notes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Dad and Mum spent the first 10 years of married life moving from worksite to worksite in Wisconsin, Texas, Alabama, Tennessee, New Hampshire, Connecticut, Maine and perhaps a few others. Christmas ws a special time for her.</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Another good year.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We are still here, still together, still in our own home and mostly managing on our own with the help of local restaurants and meal suppliers .I had a light case of Covid but Carol has escaped so far.</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Carol is doing fine, she looks after herself around the house but needs to rest quite a bit. She no longer tends her garden but we managed to spend July and August<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>at our cottage. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Brian and Marie, Janet and Mike spent <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>time with us at the cottage this summer; it is so peaceful atching the sunsets and the tranquil Orwell Bay. It is such a eautiful setting with the red cliffs on all sides of us. Five of the originals still summer there, plus a number of their offspring.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>How fortunate we are!</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>PEI suffered a devasting hurricane in September.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We were without electricity for seven days; we also lost some trees in our back yard. Fortunately no one was hurt.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Janet came home for a week to tend out on us,</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Children. grandchildren and great Granddaughter keep well but live too far away. We are thankful that all keep well and Marie keeps us<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>up to date with photos.</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Think I reportrd last year on Brian’s retirement. He and Marie bought a camper trailer and travel in Western USA. They just returned from a trip yo Egypt and Jordan. Janet and Mike are regular<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>visitors to Washington and Janet managed a visit a couple in the Middle East that she first met<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>while teaching in Korea.</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Doesn’t take much tokeep me busy. Still have regular coffees with old friends and retirees, I keep busy with my education and family tree stuff. If I do anything further, I will update some family information.</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Trust that you folks are well and continue ti escape the Covid.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It has been so good over the years to have a great network of friends and relatives for support.</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b><i>To friends and family, wherever you are, although we may not actually touch base often, you are much in our thoughts and prayers as we write this note.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>May this Christmas season bring peace and joy to you, to your families and all who you hold dear.</i></b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b><i>Merry Christmas</i></b></p>
