<p>	The following life sketch was written by my mother during her ninety-fifth year and is inserted here with no special thought that the general reader may be interested in her or her people, but because there is in it and between the lines an evidence of courage and fortitude, which in her characteristic modesty she would deny as unusual or praiseworthy, and which could no doubt be duplicated many times in a recital of the incidents making up the life stories of the pioneer citizens of the Province.</p>
<p>Of such stuff was New Brunswick and all this New World built.</p>

<p><i>(By Elizabeth Henry, who was Frederick Henry’s mother)</i></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>“It is little I can say for my family. I was not much at home after I was fourteen. My father and mother were born, both I believe, in County Cork, Ireland. Father and his mother, four brothers and one sister came on a sailing vessel. I do not know the date nor where they landed.</p>
<p>“Mother’s name was Mary Love. She had a mother and two sisters and two brothers. One brother, George Love, was in the Union Army in the Civil War. I cannot tell if they all came to America together or not but they soon parted, only one sister remaining in New Brunswick. Father and mother were married at New Bandon about the year 1833. They had seven children.</p>
<p>“After their marriage they settled in Salmon Beach on the south shore of the Bay de Chaleur. Here I was born, April 9, 1844. Lived there and went to school whenever there was school as it was hard to get teachers. When I was fourteen years old I went to school five miles away and remained a year. Went home and worked and studied as best I could for two years. In the year 1862 and part of 1863 I taught school in Youghall, and then went to Bathurst to High School. In January, 1864 I went to Normal School in Saint John. (Note. There was no railroad so her father took her from Clifton to Shediac in a sleigh. This was about 135 miles over rough winter roads. She then went by train to St. John.) After graduating I returned home April 23, 1864. Caught the measles and was sick for three months. October 1, 1864 I went to Clifton to teach school. A week or two after that I met a young man whose name was George Henry. We were married by Rev. William NcKeil in the Episcopal Church at Clifton June 13, 1865.</p>
<p>After teaching one year I quit as the school house was not fit to teach in. We had been living with my husband’s people since our marriage so remained on during the winter. On April 8<sup>th</sup>, 1866 our son John was born. As spring advanced the stone quarries opened and my husband hired out to turn grinding stone in a mill. So passed the summer and as winter was coming on my father wished us to come and spend the winter and he and my husband get [got] timber out of the woods. In April, 1867 my husband went back to work in the stone quarry and I engaged to go to Pokeshaw to teach school, leaving my one year old child with my mother and sister.</p>
<p>At Pokeshaw I could not find a house to board in. They were all dirty Irish. I stayed for six months by hiring an empty house from a widower. Here I lived alone except Saturday evening and Sundays when my husband came home from his work. In September he hurt his knee which laid him up for two years, during which time he had to go on crutches. The doctor wanted to take his leg off above the knee but I would not hear of it. Two months after he was hurt my second child was born. In January my brother Tom came to my father-in-law’s and took us all home to my father’s.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>My husband lay for quite a number of weeks suffering pain in his leg but at last we got a doctor that relieved him so he could get around. During the winter father and brother Tom got out enough lumber to put up a nice frame house at Clifton into which we moved. At this time, I had an ulcer on my eye from which I was almost blind, but after three or four months of suffering I recovered my sight and was able to go on again. We fitted up part of our house and started a shop by which we did very well during the summer while the crowds worked the quarry, then winter set in and we could do nothing. Then the neighbors told me to turn my shop into a school and they would later build me a new school house. This I did. In a few weeks all was ready and I began from nine until four o’clock with one hour for recess. Grandma Henry cared for my baby. My oldest boy John was still at my father’s at Salmon Beach. January, 1868 the young men and women begged me to teach a night school. This I did two hours from 7 to 9 o’clock, four nights a week for three months. The people built the school house and I taught for three years.</p>
<p>In March, 1870 our third son was born. I hired a girl to take care of the children and went back to finish my contract that ended in October. Then I settled down for a winter at home. Winter over and men coming back to work I took in sewing. I bought a sewing machine and made coats, vests, pants and shirts. In November my mother died and I brought John home and the following April he started to school. June, 1872 another son was born. Later my husband shipped on board a schooner to Boston to look for work as he was well again except for a stiff knee. He could not get work and returned home. Life went on as usual, working in the quarry during the summer and living around home in the winter.</p>
<p>The winter of 1873 found us in a camp cooking for a crew of men working on the Red Pine section of the Intercolonial Railroad between Saint John and Bathurst. In the spring moved back to Clifton. In 1874 a son was born but lived only a few minutes. In 1875 another son was born, and a year after we went to Canobie where I engaged to teach school. I remained there five years – teaching three years. While there a son and daughter were born in April, 1881 we left Canobie and came to Portland, Maine.</p>
<p>After coming here things improved some but it still was live to work and work to live.”</p>

<p><span>MEMORIES AND PIONEER EXPERIENCES</span></p>
<p><b>tc \l1 "“AS A TALE THAT IS TOLD”</b><b></b></p>
<p>(Recorded at the age of ninety-nine)</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>	 “I was born in Courtmasherry, County Cork, Ireland on February sixth, 1799, only a short distance from the city of Cork. My maiden name was Mary Ann Harley and my father was a school teacher. One sister lived to be ninety-four and died on her birthday. I can remember where I was born and lived very well and also the names of many of my old friends and school-mates.</p>
<p>One of the first things I can remember was hearing my father and mother talk about the “Rising of ‘98", the year before I was born, and which people talked of much as I grew older. My father was English decent and was an Episcopalian, the church in which I was brought up.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Very well I can remember the day when two big war ships sailed into Cork harbor, decks crowded and masts gay with flags, bringing the first news that we had received of Waterloo, (1815) in which that “terror of the world”, and “ogre of history”, Napoleon, was defeated by our own Duke of Wellington. The people went crazy with joy, the bells of the city were rung and big bonfires were lighted in celebration. Three ships brought home wounded Irish soldiers who fought at Waterloo and there was great rejoicing at their return. Three of the officers of one Irish regiment were quartered at my father’s house many days and I can remember the stories they told of that terrible fight. Their bright uniforms and handsome faces made a great impression on me.</p>
<p>In 1822 I went on a visit to a lady friend of our family at Queenstown, and while there, there came into that harbour the first steamboat seen in Irish waters. Everybody turned out and lined the docks to see the strange craft which moved so swiftly without sails or oars.</p>
<p>While at Queenstown I got a letter from my brother, William Harley, who was in America. He was a Dominion Government surveyor and he wanted me to come over as soon as possible as he had a young, handsome, wealthy husband waiting for me. I went home to my father’s house and it was soon decided that I should sail for America. I left Ireland when I was twenty-three years old. I was one of 150 passengers on board a sailing ship which left Cork, May 7, 1822. It was a terrible voyage. I was sick about all the way and glad enough to sight land after seven weeks and three days. I landed at Pokeshaw on Bay de Chaleur, New Brunswick. It was a very small settlement with only a few houses and they were all built of logs. My brother was waiting for me. We had to walk seventy-five miles to get to his home as there were no roads, no conveyances and not even a path. It was a trackless forest in which not a tree had been cut. We made our way by aid of a compass over windfalls, and across brooks to Newcastle, on the Miramichi River. We were three nights on the road and had to sleep in the woods without shelter. On the fourth night we got to Newcastle and here we found a small settlement.</p>
<p>Eight months afterward I married John Henry who was the Agent and Business Manager for a large mercantile company. He was born in Armagh, north Ireland, the son of a Presbyterian minister. We were married in Newcastle on March 21, 1823 by the Reverend Samuel Beacon. We had nine children, seven of whom grew up and married. My husband died in 1871. I had a brother, John Harley, who was a ship builder on Bolter’s Island near Newcastle.”</p>

<p><br></p>
<p>Still living Spirit of my ancient sires,</p>
<p>Come from that land of seer and bard,</p>
<p>Of chalice and of sword,</p>
<p>To breathe upon these words</p>
<p>And give them life.</p>
<p>With the fact in mind of so man settlers coming to America from Ireland with Scotch and English ancestry, one almost naturally raises the questions as to how these people came to be on Irish soil.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In the latter part of the 16<sup>th</sup> century and the early 17<sup>th</sup> century England began planning her schemes of colonization.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Ireland was a fertile, undeveloped land near at hand.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was roman Catholic in faith and tribal in this social structure.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>England wished to introduce a Protestant element and also needs the land than but sparsely populated, and involved in it was the plan to dispossess the turbulent natives.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This colonial population would also secure the mother country against the use of Ireland as a landing place for any enemies from the Continent who were generally able to gain the friendly cooperation of the natives.</p>
<p>The early schemes related to Munster and some attempts were unsuccessfully made on Ulster, but with the flight of the Irish leaders of the opposition the major part of Ulster was escheated to the King and the territory became the center of interest.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Ulster was the strongest, richest and most Irish of the provinces.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Incidentally it was the center of St. Patrick’s religious and education activities.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>At Armagh he fixed his Cathedral church and he is said to be buries at Downpatrick.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Since the end of the 16<sup>th</sup> century mand Scottish highlanders had settled there, led by the Macdonalds.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>England tried to drive them out on account of the alliance between Scotland and Ireland , but after the union of the crowns of England and Scotland in 1603 the Scottish migration to Ulster was encouraged.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Within a few years they planted Ulster county with thousand of tenants, the ancestors of the Scots Irish or Ulster Scots.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This could easily be done since the channel between is in places so narrow that a person standing on the North Irish coast can on a clear day distinguish houses on the Scottish shore.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Dorry was settled by English colonists under an ancien housing project.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The City of London built two hundred houses there and made a further contract to build three hundred more.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As a result its name was changed to Londonderry.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In Cromwell’s day many English families were settled in Ireland.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In the many rebellions of the Irish people against English rule English soldiers were quartered, sometimes for long periods, during which the often inter-married with the Irish, thus bringing English names into the mixed population.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Married men sent back to England for their families.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When the necessity of military control passed many of these people elected to remain permanently. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Descendants of theses various groups became emigrants to all sections of North America, and came affected by several centuries or generations of Irish thought and culture.</p>
<p><span>A</span> <span>PREFACE</span></p>
<p>In writing these notes my first desire was to freshen fading but always haunting memories, and then came the afterthought that a friendly reader might find some moments of pleasure and perhaps profit in the story of a phase of life which should not be allowed to pass into forgetfulness.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As little as possible names and persons enter for I have tried to draw a picture of the normal, everyday life of a community and its environment.</p>
<p>As the record unfolds and one notes the short list of what might be called conveniences, and the absence of luxuries—few mechanical helps and social outlets—one might think that we hardly lived in these seemingly empty years. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But this is far from the truth.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Life was enriched by what might now seem insignificant and not worth mentioning, but to us really important and full of meaning.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Life was simple, but we lived.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Most important, we were the more thrown upon our own inner resources which developed a wealth of initiative and self-reliance.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In a real sense life was rich in comparison with much of the satiated sophisticated existence of modern days.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We lived close to nature and the immediate source of daily food, rather than upon the prepared supplies which stock our present day pantries.</p>
<p>Looking back upon the simple tools—the sickle, flail, spinning-well, loom and other few implements and machines, I am reminded that we were living under many conditions not much improved or advanced beyond ancient civilizations.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Clothing may have changed in style but he methods of production—preparation of the wool, spinning and weaving—had not changed in several thousand year.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The farmer had just added a colter to his wooden plough, but was reaping with a hand sickle and beating out the ripened grain with a flail.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Cooking was largely done over open fires.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Civilization had arrived at the middle of the nineteenth century with the same machines and aids to labor which had been the common possession of humanity for many centuries.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I watched men at work on the farms as I might have seen them in the days of Greece and Rome.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Our houses were illuminated with dips and candles like those familiar to ancient and medieval times.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>But we were at the threshold of a new age—man and women were about to be released from the bondage of rude makeshifts in the home and on the farm.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In retrospect it seems strange, yet exhilarating, to have had a part in the life of this vanishing age—to have been born in the dawning of the industrial revolution—to have experienced methods and customs that give an understanding and interpretation to long-past historic civilizations.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The years are not many but measuring time by progress our world has taken many long strides—it has traveled with Seven League boots.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Simple ways and thinking have given way to the influences of a fast-moving, complex living.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I think this is not altogether true of the land of my birth.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Its people are still close to the earth and the sea—Forests that have never known a common road or path still welcome the occasional wanderer to their aisles of silence, and a hunter needs an experiences guide to penetrate deep into their trailless wilds.</p>
<p>When one considers the rapidity with which progressing changes enter into our modern life, we cannot be too often reminded of the days of our fathers and mothers—days whose passing we many sincerely regret in sober and worthwhile moments.</p>
<p>This regret is well expressed by Roland B. Dixon in his “The Building of Cultures.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“We believe that what is changing, what has perished, is replaced by something better, and that what we are witnessing is a phenomenon for which we should be profoundly thankful.---Yet one cannot but feel a certain regret that so much of the colorful variety in culture which existed so recently, has passed or is doomed to pass away.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>One cannot help feeling a wistful longing for the old pageantry and romance, the clear-cut individualities which are being ruthlessly eliminated from an increasingly standardized world.-------The past is always glamourous--yet glamor aside, in the breaking down and disappearance of individualized cultures, culture as a whole has suffered a real loss---- The fact takes something of the flavor and bouquet out of life.”</p>
<p>If a record of these memories shall help restore the finer qualities of that past, they will have served a useful purpose.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The enduring things of the present will be found rooted in past excellencies—faith, love, truth, and loyalty.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Insofar as these are absent in any age, life will be artificial.</p>
<p>The day following the writing of these lines I was attracted by this passage.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Above all, I do not believe that any civilization can be called complete until it has made a conscious return to simplicity.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The wisdom of life consists in the elimination of non-essentials, and of finding contentment in those things closest to us—the enjoyment of home, of every day living and of nature.”</p>
<p>“The Importance of Living” Lin Yutang</p>
<p>In writing these notes I am impressed with the thought that no man knows what simple things will draw his footsteps down the aisles of memory—An Irish poet in the following lines expresses the same strange wonder:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>“Four ducks on a pond,</p>
<p>A grass-bank beyond,</p>
<p>A blue sky of spring,</p>
<p>White clouds on the wing --</p>
<p>What a little thing</p>
<p>To remember for years --</p>
<p>To remember with tears.”</p>
<p>“A Memory” <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Wm. Allingham</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span>THE PROVINCE AND ITS PEOPLE</span></p>
<p>New Brunswick is a land for those –</p>
<p>“Who love the haunts of nature,</p>
<p>Love the sunshine and the meadow,</p>
<p>Love the shadow of the forest,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Love the wind among the branches,</p>
<p>And the rain-shower and the snowstorm,</p>
<p>And the rushing of great rivers</p>
<p>Through their palisades of Pine trees.”</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Its history began when Jaques Cartier sailed into Baie de Chaleur four centuries ago.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>At that time and for a long subsequent period, it was the rich hunting ground of the Micmac and Malicete Indians, both of whom in their association with French and English wrote many a bloody page into early American history.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The Province was and still remains one of the wealthiest and most interesting fish and game sections of North America.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A great portion of its territory is still native forest and its bays and rivers are the natural breeding places for the choicest fish of the Atlantic, and remains the source of fishermen’s wealth, not only locally but for the great fleets form New England.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Its villages and towns are confined almost entirely to the coast line and the rivers, leaving the heart of it a great game refuge.</p>
<p>Soon after the discovery of this section of America the French began settlements along the seashore where life was easily sustained by a little primitive farming and the easily obtained, plentiful food from the water.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>These simple French peasants early began intermarriage with the Indians.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But these people lacked a real colonial policy and did little or nothing forth material development of the Province during their one hundred and fifty years of control.</p>
<p>Then came its conquest by England, when there began a vigorous campaign of colonization.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Scattered group settlements were established by North Ireland Protestants, South Ireland Catholics, and Scotch Presbyterians including also some Englishmen.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Among these were many ex-soldiers, veterans from Waterloo.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>One of the most interesting groups to markedly affect the destiny of the Provinces was the thousands of United Empire Loyalists, those ex-soldiers and ostracized British sympathizers who fled form the United States at the close of the Revolutionary War.</p>
<p>The importance of this movement is well stated by Mrs. Lillian B. Maxwell in her recent valuable book, “The History of Central New Brunswick”when she says — “The War of the Revolution in the British Colonies of America was the birth of modern Canada.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Without the immigration of the loyal subjects of Britain to the territories which are now Ontario and the Maritime Provinces, Canada would have been a French colony under British rule.”</p>
<p>These people formed a citizenry of a superior class, being families of wealth, culture and ability.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They were forced to leave most of their wealth behind them in the U.S. but their intelligent leadership was an inestimable contribution to the prosperity of the Province; in fact it was through their influence that New Brunswick established its separate existence.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In after years the Province has returned to the U.S., perhaps with interest, a long list of families and individuals who have given outstanding leadership in statesmanship, education, law and religion.</p>
<p>During its long history the development of the country by these varying stream of pioneering spirits furnishes many a page of heroic endeavor.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Its entire shore territory has suffered the fortunes of war. —Indians against whites and recurring attacks of French and English and Americans.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Altogether the story of New Brunswick is a graphic one and into it are woven names that shed glory upon American history.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Any son or daughter can recall with pride the creditable inheritance bequeathed to the by the simple-hearted and hardy citizens who have put their lives into the up-building of the Province.</p>
<p>New Brunswick as a separate Province as still young when my grandparents came form Ireland, and just before I was born all the Provinces were finally consolidated into the Dominion of Canada, and during this period they saw small log-cabin settlements grow of thriving communities of substantial frame houses.</p>
<p>As these settlers often came indefinite groups out of localized districts in the British Isles they preserved that unity on arrival and settled in prescribed and often isolated districts.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>New Brunswick offers an alluring study in origins. One can readily trace the first steps of the various national groups which settled within her borders.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Some accepted without change the names of rivers, lakes, mountains and localities, which the native Indians had used for centuries.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Here alone is a field full of mystery, romance, and poetry all involved in grotesque superstitions and primitive-minded interpretations of nature.</p>
<p>Then the French, English, Scotch, Irish, and Dutch peoples brought their memories and loyalties and around the names of people and old homes that they admired and loved they established the settlements and villages of their hopes and dreams.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>So as you journey in any direction across the province you will find embalmed in local names old world references to persons and places, and if you could read the whole story you would uncover many a tale of romance or tragedy or a new recital of that stirring yet undramatic march of human spirits seeking along unblazed trails a better country.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Without any aid and lacking leadership trained in new world ways, they groped their way through simple and primitive adjustments, not being aware of conveniences in methods and implements of, being at times too poor to purchase such improvements, they had to content themselves with such assistance as they could get from the crude tools.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Education in new methods and more improved implements was often impede in this movements by seemingly slight but efficient barriers.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There were impassable roads.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Individuals traveled very little and so there was limited interchange of ideas.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Communities felt sufficient unto themselves, and held to their exclusiveness by family ties and common origin, accentuated when it found itself in conflict with national differences.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>These and other factors delayed the process of advancement.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Yet many of these pioneer men and women came prepared in knowledge and spirit for the tasks that awaited them.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They were fundamentally healthy and were endowed with a vigorous spirit of endurance and adventure.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They were also more or less equipped by training in some handicraft or trade.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A general system of apprenticeship was in operation in practically all the British Isles.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The simpler trades necessary for the setting up of isolated or community farm-life could be found in almost any settlement—farmers with practical knowledge of both plant culture and animal husbandry, carpenters, blacksmiths, and general ironworkers, weavers, surveyors, and a reasonable supply of intelligent, if not trained, educators to inaugurate the beginnings of a school system.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In the original community life these trades and abilities were bartered one for the other so that there was little necessity for a complicated financial system.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This developed a spirit of cooperation and the common difficulties of eking out a living tended to destroy many of the localized racial and religious antipathies.</p>
<p>While these heavier material burdens were accepted by the men, this life made its serious demands upon the women.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In it they developed a praiseworthy initiative and resourcefulness.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They became doctors, without title or license, midwives and nurses.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was a rare child that came into the world with the aid of a physician, as the service was efficiently rendered by some good woman neighbor.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>With simple remedies and energetic care they brought their children through the continuity of childhood diseases.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They became emergency caretakers in the many accidents that marked the rugged occupations of the time.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They eased with solicitous care the sufferings of the sick and dying—closed their eyes in death and shrouded them for their burial.</p>
<p>Neither homesickness nor physical hardships could discourage such people.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In many instances they had traded their old-country hampered existence for a free life both of mind and body, and while this new life made strenuous demands, yet they joyed in the venture of wresting a living from the virgin soil and the thought that they were building a new social structure.</p>
<p>Any analysis of the effects of this new world upon these argonauts of civilization should not leave out of mind the aesthetic appeal—the spiritual exaltation—which created new values in life or enhanced the old.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There is a seeming awareness of this in the following passage from Mitchell’s “American Village,”</p>
<p>“The tremendous virgin forests of America must have made a deep impression upon the advance guard of settlers form the Old World.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is easy to imagine them pausing for a moment to look at each other with a mild surmise before plunging into the work of hewing out a place for themselves on the edge of the new continent.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The sight of the giant trees must have been heartening, for here, seemingly, was not only an inexhaustible supply of timber with which to build homes, but also endless wood to burn.”</p>
<p>Owing to the varied soils; here a stretch of shales, or a surface of marl—an outcropping of gray or red sandstone and their rich deposits brought from remote sources by the annual freshets of the numerous brooks and rivers, all of it crumbled and powdered by ages of varying seasons of sun and storm, and reinvigorated by eons of fallen foliage—all of this accompanied by a climate with much rain and snow, summer heat and winter cold, developed a wide variety of wood and foliage which gave the whole country a rare and entrancing beauty.</p>
<p>Centuries of civilization and its wasteful demand upon natural resources in the old country had denuded hills and valleys of all trees except those enclosed within the preserves of aristocratic landlords and the taking of a tree or wood from such a place was a serious offense if not a criminal act.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Coming fresh from such environment it is not strange that this country was a new world—a world in which the emigrant became at once a landed proprietor and in which he discovered within himself new and enlarged mental and spiritual possibilities.</p>
<p>And so beyond this seeming first impression of utility and material values there must have been a spiritual reaction inspired by the beauty revealed in the kaleidoscopic changes of the seasons.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>To such sights a man’s nature cannot remain indifferent.</p>
<p>In these fresh silences souls were reborn—the ugliness of Old World fears, hates, intrigues, and political repression vanished—and men experienced the heritage of freedom.</p>

<p><span>THE</span> <span>HOUSE</span></p>
<p>	Canobie was a small L-shaped gap in the woods, grubbed out by pioneers seeking a home. In my day it was only 25 or 30 years old and the grants were originally taken by Scotch people who gave the settlement its name after a town in Scotland. Our neighbor families were of the following nationalities: One English, one Scotch, one Scotch-Irish, three Irish Catholic and four Irish Protestant. A few rods off the road or beyond the “clearnings’ and one was surrounded by the primeval forest without beaten trail except that of its wild denizens as they sought food or water.</p>
<p>One can readily imagine the fearsome but alluring mystery it held and how a boy hoped and longed for the day when he might be big enough to enter into its shadowed depths. Within these whispering trees and tangled undergrowth was a kingdom of adventure – a place to be startled by any unfamiliar sound and held rigid at times by silences in which the only sound was the beating of your own heart quickened by what might be moving behind a great tree or by imagining strange sharp eyes peering from the thickly matted underbrush.</p>
<p>Whittier had such a spot in mind when he wrote —<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“Only here and there a clearing<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>with its farm house rude and new,</p>
<p>And tree-stumps, swart as Indians</p>
<p>Where the scanty harvest grew.”</p>
<p>“Cobbler Keezer’s Vision”</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The first thing essential to the new settler was a house and as the Province was almost completely covered with forest the necessary timbers could be found on the acres selected for the future farm.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The government began early in 1800 an organized campaign to draw home-seekers from England, Ireland and Scotland.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Some effort was also made in the States.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When the tide of immigration really began, the government prepared printed instructions advising just how to build a log-house; according to this circular these houses were about 22 x 16 with a hip roof covered with sheets of spruce bark which should be stripped from the trees in June or July.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This bark rood idea was no doubt borrowed from the Indians as they used bark for both roof and siding on some of their communal buildings.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Detailed instructions were given for building a fire-place and chimney, the latter either of stone and clay or sticks with clay mixed with straw.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Some settlers sawed boards by hand but where this was not possible “the ground floor can be made of hewn spruce and the upper or attic floor of straight poles.”</p>
<p>This description reveals the fact that stoves were apparently not known or not easy to obtain.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Less than fifty years later no house was built with a fireplace and stoves were being manufactured in the province, first the plain box type and later the improved built-in oven type.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Stoves were an American invention.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In never saw a house in the province with a fireplace.</p>
<p>On many occasions these original houses were hastily erected by a group of neighbors, and a contemporary description is interesting.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>When a cabin was to be built, whether for a new couple or for a newly arriving family, the neighbors gathered.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The first day a party of choppers went out to fell trees and cut them into proper lengths, while a man with a team hauled them to the place and piled them where they should be used, at the sides and ends of the future cabin.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Another man searched the woods for a proper tree for making the clapboards for the roof.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It must be straight-grained and from three to four feet in diameter.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Others got together puncheon for the floor, made by splitting trees about eighteen inches in diameter and hewing their faces with a broad axe.</p>
<p>The first thing to be done the second day was to select four men, the corner men, who notches and placed the logs as they were brought to them and laid them up in the wall.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This required skill.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The door was made by cutting an opening through the logs about three feet wide and putting up timbers for the sides of the doorway.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The roof was made by shortening the logs at the ends until a single log would form the ridge.</p>
<p>Some made mortar and filled in the chinks between the logs while others mad the door of boards, leveled off the floor, and made a built-in bed, a table and a few stools.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Some pegs around the walls supplied a convenient place to hang clothes.</p>
<p>Wood shingles were used for nearly all roof covering.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The saw-mills made them but hey were so expensive many people split their own.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They were cut form cedar, pine or hemlock.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The selection of the logs was guided by certain outer marks.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Straight grain was indicated by the bark.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The quality of the wood for rot by the knots.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The logs being selected they were sawed in 18 inch lengths called “bolts.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The equipment for splitting was as follows: (A) A large hardwood block on which to stand the bolt; (B) This bolt was marked with lines 3/8 inch apart to designate the thickness of the butt of the shingle.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The tool for splitting was called a frow or froe.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>(C) This was very much like a modern cleaver.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The cutting edge was set on the line marked on the bolt and while held in this position a man with a huge wooden maul; (D) or mallet, struck the top of the frow driving the edge into the wood.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The result was a number of strips of wood 18" long and varying in width according to the size of the log. (E) To taper these into shingles there was additional equipment.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A long narrow table (G) with four flaring legs for stability, the rear end of the table being lower than the other.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Near the center of the table was fitted a “Key,” (G) This was a vertical wooden bar the top end of which held a horizontal metal strip with teeth and at the lower en was a cross bar upon which the feet of the operator rested as he sat at the raised end of the table.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A strip of the wood (E) was laid on the table wit the upper end directly under the metal teeth.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>With a pressure of the feet the teeth were set into the wood holding it rigid.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Then the operator took draw knife or drawshave, (H) and shaved the shingle to a thin edge at the lower end.</p>
<p>Our own house was built very much according to these descriptions.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When we came to Canobie a neighbor family ad just moved away from their small house and here we lived while father and the neighbors built what was to be our future home. The house was 26 x 20 and the logs used were about 10 inches in diameter and extended about 18 inches where they were notched and lapped at the corners.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Incidentally these corners made nice places for children to climb. The walls were fifteen logs high and topped by a hip-roof.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>On the inside the logs were stripped of their bark but it was left on the outside.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>These logs were cut in our own woods and before being set up in the wall were slightly squared on top and bottom and any chinks between were stuffed with hay.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The ceiling was eight feet high and two feet of the walls extended into the attic.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The gables were boarded in. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The roof was of boards laid vertically from the ridge to the eaves where they extended about nine inches.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Extra over-lapping boards were laid to cover each joint to guard against leaking.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But after a hard snow storm and the wind in the right direction, we often woke to find little mounds of snow on the floor or on top of the quilts which covered us.</p>
<p>The house was built close to the narrow road which passed it on the north end.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The one door, made of heavy boards set vertically, was on the south end about in the center and overlooking the little farm and<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>clearing and on into the thick woods beyond.</p>
<p>The building was divided by an east and west partition into two rooms.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The north and smaller room had one window overlooking the road.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In the south room were two windows, one<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>in each of the side walls.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>all the windows were half-sash having six lights of 8 x 10 glass.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The door was fastened with a wooden latch on the inside operated with a leather latch -string passed to the outside through a hole in the wood.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In the north room was a big bed and the spinning-wheel.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In the south room the stove was about in the center but nearer to the partition, and in the northeast corner was the loom.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Near the stove was the wood-box and above it you would usually find a goose or hen’s wing for brushing off the stove--an operation which on a hot stove left and odor of burnt feathers.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There was no chimney and the stove-pipe went up through the ceiling and the roof.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The family table was placed on the was side.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Chairs and benches were scattered around for seats.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Above these rooms was a full attic reached by a ladder in the corner of the south room.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As we grew up this “loft”became our sleeping-room where we slept on homemade wooden bedsteads with straw “ticks,” under heavy quilts.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There was a window in the south end.</p>
<p>Floors in all houses had no paint on them, and with gardens and fields so close and dooryards void of grass it was no easy task to keep them clean. It was a mark of a good housekeeper to show white, unspotted floors to all callers.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This meat hard scrubbing, often with soap suds, sometimes mixing a little sand to create sufficient abrasion. it was surprising how white and shiny these floors would be, but it evidenced hard work down on the knees for the mother or some older boy or girl.</p>
<p>With the rapid development of sawmills these log houses served a temporary purpose and were generally replaced in a few years by a frame house and the log-house torn down.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In our day log-houses were rare.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In fact ours was the only one in the settlement and it passed out or existence a few years after we left it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It remains only as a memory,– but such a memory. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>On the more prosperous farms were very large barns about which a word<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>might be said.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They were rather mammoth in comparison with the dwelling.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Although<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>our weather was as severe as in New England, these barns were built some distance away from the house and not connected with it by intermediate out-buildings as was the custom there.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In this they also departed from old country style where the farm home was one of compact and connected buildings.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>These barns had great double doors, each door often built in two sections so that when fully opened loads of hay might be drawn to be forked up to a floor above, a hay-loft, built like a great balcony occupying the rear and two sides.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Under this were the pens and stalls for cattle, horses, and sheep.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The front center of the main floor was used as a threshing floor at harvest time. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>These immense barns often occasion surprise on the part of a city dweller, or one who lives in a milder climate, who does not realize that the entire live-stock of the farm including the poultry must here be housed both day and night for the winter.</p>
<p>One valued asset which came from these barns, was the accumulation of manure fertilizer.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>when properly aged, which is important, it returned to the soil elements which had been removed by the growing crops.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>On the Shore, in fact all around the sea-coast, the land was further enriched by the use of fish.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>All fish in excess of community needs were thrown into the fields and plowed in.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This may have been learned from the Indians for when the white man came to America he found that the Indian when he planted corn added if possible fish as a fertilizer–his system was a fish to a hill.</p>
<p>Being born in or living one’s childhood in a log-house is a unique experience.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It does something to one’s personality.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A man is liable never to be able to get away from its influence. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The logs still seem to be living things.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They are natural – not artificial.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They still belong to the virgin soil and the surrounding woods.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Except for the axe they have not felt the mutilating tools of civilization which would have torn and shredded them into fragments called boards and joists and rafters – the makings of a frame house.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The log house has ruggedness – sturdiness.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There is a sense of security, and simplicity.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The atmosphere of<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>it breathes honesty and humility.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is in harmony with the surrounding country of trees and growing fields and meadows.</p>
<p>Lift the latch of its solid plank door and enter into an atmosphere that no frame house can ever enclose, and if there is a fire-place in the far wall it will speak a welcome and extend a hospitality that will penetrate to the cockles of your heart.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When night comes on climb to the room under the roof and lie awake, not because you cannot sleep, but because of a wakeful sense of peace that you should not deny yourself.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You listen to the steady soft grinding of a worm working his way into the log near your head–or the wind whistling<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>through a loose board; and then the rain begins, first in heavy drops and then it moves into a rhythmic downpour which gradually dies away like departing feet.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>For you it is soundless silence.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A robin calls impatiently to its mate.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You hear it as if in a dreamy distance.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There is no sound of rain. The wind sighs through wet leaves.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is morning and you lie awake in the log-house in the clearing.</p>
<p><span>THE</span> <span>FARM</span></p>
<p>The first work done on new land was the cutting out of undergrowth and small trees.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The larger trees were then cut down and the stumps remained.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Some of<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>these trees were used for necessary building. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The small trees made good fence rails or with the heavy branches of the large ones and the tops, supplied valuable fire-wood, and the small shrubs and other brush were piled up and burned.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Very often the ground was covered with scattered stones, which were gathered in little piles or heaped around the stumps.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>For several seasons the land cleared between the stumps was used for various crops and this virgin soil gave valuable returns, adding much to the support of the family.</p>
<p>Speaking of clearing the land of stones brings to mind an interesting phenomenon.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>All surface stones are first removed and then follows the initial plowing.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>While this was not deep yet it brought up an additional lot hidden just below the surface.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But when these are removed a soil comparatively free from stones is found for a depth of from one to three feet.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This is ascribed to the fact that stones and other mass substances in the soil<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>have a tendency, during the frosts of winter, to rise to the surface from depths of three or four feet.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The frost penetrates in many places to three feet and sometimes deeper in severe winters; and it is observed that stones in this upper layer gradually come up to the surface; so that, if a field be perfectly cleared of stones one year, a new crop will be found on the land in the course of the next year, if the soil within the frost line contains any.</p>
<p>Our farm consisted of eight acres of forest land granted by the government to my grandfather Smith on the established condition that<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>a house be built and five acres cleared and cultivated and residence be maintained for a few years.</p>
<p>This option he transferred to mother when the family came to Canobie to live.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Our tillable farm was small.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A few acres was entirely freed of stumps and stones while a part still held the stumps of recently felled trees.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This partially reclaimed land was called the “clearing.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Beyond this lay the virgin woods, the home of mystery, the dwelling-place of wild life large and small.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Into this we never ventured far.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The clearing of the ground recalls a unique stumping machine which we used.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was a tripod standing about nine or ten feet high.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The legs were made of ash or oak about four by four inches.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Attached in the apex was a large ratchet wheel coupled with a block and tackle operated<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>with chains. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Extending horizontally from the wheel was a long, stout<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>bar upon which several men could pull downward to furnish the leverage.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The stumps were loosened as thoroughly as possible by digging away the soil and cutting the long side roots; the chains were attached to the stump and when the leverage was applied it was remarkable what power was developed to tear the remaining embedded roots out of the soil.</p>
<p>When finally uprooted, these stumps might occasionally be dragged near the wood pile to eventually be split up for fuel. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Often not a very easy job.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Or, in late summer, when they had a season of drying, they were piled up for a great bonfire.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>To children this was an exciting spectacle, especially if it occurred at early night-fall.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But one of the most picturesque uses was to pile them along the edge of the woods in a line to form a fence.</p>
<p>The common fence was the “serpentine” cross-rail, the rails set at opposite angles so as<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>to cross each other at the ends, which with its corners usually filled with tall mixed weeds formed an attractive margin to our fields.</p>
<p>Another, more carefully constructed, was the “block and rail,” a straight fence, the ends of the rails over-lapping each other and sometimes blocked to increase the vertical space between.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The ends were set between two light upright sapling posts set in the ground, the tops of which were bound together with long flexible willow twigs or withes.</p>
<p>Within the confines of these varied fences was staged the drama of growth from seedtime to harvest.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Across the plowed and harrowed ground the sower passed with his bag slung at his side under his arm, or wearing a short apron with a huge pocket to hold his seed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He moved with long, swinging strides and methodically sprayed with a wide motion of his hand the pregnant seed upon the waiting earth.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>From the very beginnings of agriculture this figure has moved across the fields of unnumbered centuries even to our own day and after, but was soon to be banished forever, except in the most isolated areas, by mechanical planters.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But he is immortalized in that graphic word picture still fresh and unimproved after two thousand years.---The Galilean peasant stands to represent the sowers of all time.</p>
<p>“Behold a sower went forth to sow; and when he sowed, some seed fell by the wayside, and the fowls came and devoured the up; some fell upon stony places, where they had not much earth; and forthwith they sprung up, because they had no deepness of earth; and when the sun was up, they were scorched; and because they had no root, they withered away.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And some fell among thorns; and the thorns sprung up, and choked them: but other fell into good ground, and brought forth fruit, some an hundredfold, some sixtyfold, some thirtyfold.”</p>
<p>With the first grain crops from virgin soil recently reclaimed from the forest, the sickle used by either men or women was the most useful harvesting tool. The space cleared between standing stumps was often not large enough to swing the scythe and until these stumps and often large stones were removed the sickle was of necessity a common and valuable possession of all farmers.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This harvesting of grain with these hand sickles was a back-breaking task, and the average worker could cut no more than half an acre in a day.</p>
<p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In the cleared fields the scythe replaced the sickle and it was a pleasant sight to watch the rhythmic movements of a bronzed, perspiring mower as he passed through a field of ripened grain or tall bearded hay, and watch it fall in grace and silence into level ranks upon the ground.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Later the grain will be cradled or raked into sheaves and tied with a rope made of the long straws knotted together, and then piled into a shock of five or six sheaves, some of the m standing upright, and other laid horizontal to protect the main body of the shock against the occasional rains.</p>
<p>The hay will be raked into small cocks when it has lain in the sun and been sufficiently dried or cured,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>and then forked onto flat open-railed trucks called hay-racks to be transported to the center of the field and piled in great stacks, or taken directly to the barns for feeding to the sheltered animals during the long winters when snow and ice covered all pastures.</p>
<p>Out of these fields there comes a sound that floats in far-echoing music across the years.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is the whining tone of the hand whetstone striking in long strokes upon the blade of the scythe to set again a keen edge for the continued onslaught upon the standing harvest.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Or perhaps it is the more gentle and staccato sound as the stone puts a new edge upon the hand sickle.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In the silent heat of a harvest day such sounds burn into one’s consciousness—symbols of an industry that keeps close to the heart of nature and the simple life.</p>
<p>In a shady spot in the shrubbery or beneath a close-leaved tree will be a can or jug of oatmeal water and only an over-heated tired mower can know the invigorating refreshment of such a mixture that is both food and drink.</p>
<p>Some of the labor of gathering the grain was saved by the occasional use of the recently invented cradle scythe which caught the falling stalks on a horizontal rack and held them in alignment, and after a stroke of the scythe the swath or cutting was tossed aside in a window to be readily bound into a sheaf.</p>
<p>The usual method of threshing small crops including oats, beans, barley, buckwheat etc., was with a flail.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This instrument was formed of two round oak or ash rods about an inch and a half in diameter and of unequal length, tied or hinged together at one end with flexible cow hide.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The hand section was about four feet long and the free or beating section about three feet.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In operation the long section was grasped firmly with both hands and then with a full chopping swing the beater was brought down flat upon the spread-out headed straw, or the ripened bean or pea vines, which had been pulled up with pods attached.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This beating process continued until all the seeds were freed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The straw or vines were then forked aside, leaving the beans, peas or grain lying in the chaff or hulls.</p>
<p>This was a slow, laborious, expensive and wasteful operation.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A day laborer will not get more than five or six bushels of grain a day.</p>
<p>There was still another method where farm animals were used, usually horses.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The material to be threshed was laid on the hard ground in a circle.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A boy or man stood in the center and with rains and whip kept them in motion treading the grain.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>At intervals the straw was drawn to the outside and the grain pulled into the center.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This system is still in use among the American Indians in the southwest where they generally use a small herd of goats.</p>
<p>Then came the winnowing.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>On a windy day this mixed mass of seed and chaff was thrown into the air by shovels and the chaff was blown away to leave the heavy seed, which had dropped to the ground to be gathered into sacks and bins for food for the family or the animals.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This is all a primitive picture little changed in untold centuries—a repetition of scenes out of the early days of human history.</p>
<p>One of the exciting experiences of our farm life was the arrival of the portable threshing machine which moved through the country at harvest time and was hired by the day or on shares to the farmers.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The power was developed by two horses of the farmer working on a treadmill attachment.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The men who accompanied the machine superintended its operation.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>At the rear of the machine was a box-stall arrangement for the horses.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Under their feet was a movable floor, a continuous, flexible cross-band of plank with slats forming a corrugated surface.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This was set at a n incline so that the horses looked as if they were climbing a steep hill.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As they walked their feet forced the platform into motion and this being grooved into the large wooden rollers, the outer ends of which were fitted with pulleys, conveyed the power, which was gauged and distributed by other pulleys and belts, to the various parts of the machine.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>For the horses it was a monotonous and tiring task.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This device had a peculiar origin.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was invented and made in England in 1818 for use in prisons and operated by men convicted to hard labor.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The original was a great drum, the face of it being covered with steps.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A large line of men stood on a step and as the drum started to move they stepped on the next above and so kept the drum in motion.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The power generated was conveyed by pulleys and belts to various machines.</p>
<p>To our boyish eyes it was an entrancing sight to watch the bearded wheat and oat stalks disappear into the machine and then see the straw pile up at one end in a golden mound, w while the treasured grains that meant life and wealth fell in a rippling stream into waiting sacks, and over and around all was the dust of the chaff which powdered the men form head of the refined essence of sunshine and rain sifted through the prolific soil of virgin fields into ripened grain.</p>
<p>Mills of various kinds were located at reasonable distances--sawmills, gristmills, and carding mills where also cloth was fulled.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The gristmill commonly took a portion or “toll” of the farmer’s grain in pay for the milling.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The power in most of these mills was water power generated through the water wheel.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Some were the “over-shot” wheel type—the water falling on the upper face of a wheel constructed with a continuous series of troughs into which the water fell.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In the “under-shot” type the wheel was a paddle-wheel and was set so that its lower edge was submerged in the current.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>So in these plentiful streams men found a power which was a ready servant waiting through the ages for the hand of man to guide it into service.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Some of the larger saw-mills had already adopted stream.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>At one of our quarries was to be found a unique form of power.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A large upright frame was erected.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In the center was a revolving upright the bottom end of it fitted with an iron spindle set into an iron socket.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The top was capped with a cog-wheel on a shaft and at the opposite end of the shaft a pulley.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>From this the power was conveyed by a belt to other pulleys.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The speed required was gauged by the size of the cog-wheels and pulleys.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>About for feet up in the center post was inserted a heavy horizontal beam at the end of which was harnessed one or two horses who walked in a continuous circle of “sweep” keeping the center shaft revolving.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This reminds me of an illustration in Milton’s “Samson Agonistes” where Samson in captivity is shown lashed to a “sweep” of the same type.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A stone quarry in our neighborhood used power developed by horses on a treadmill the same as described in the account of the threshing machine. The saw-mills used the rip-saw, worked up and down by oscillating beams, as the circular saw had not yet come into use.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This beam type of saw-mill was the mechanical application of rip or pit-sawing which had long been done by hand.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>For this a long platform was erected on which a log was laid.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A pit was dug at one end. The saw was a long one, about six feet over all, with heavy teeth and with a handle at each end set at right angles to the blade so that a man could grasp it with both hands.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>One man stood in the pit and another on the platform and thus with up and down motion they ripped the log into boards.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Such boards could be found in many an early settler’s house and represented a vast amount of back-breaking labor.</p>
<p><span></span>FARMS ANIMALS AND FOWL</p>
<p>One of the things on a simple farm that probably makes the deepest impressions upon the mind of a child is the young animal and domestic fowl life.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They are a vital part of daily existence.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Horses, cows, sheep and hens, and the full-bodied, long-necked Canada geese–and those vigorous ganders which can certainly put fear into children’s hearts.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>With the coming of spring in the re-awakening of life in plant and tree, there comes also new life and activities among the denizens of the barn-yard.</p>
<p>These happenings call a boy’s attention to mysterious and alluring thoughts–he sees these things, but partial knowledge puzzles him–adult talk is rather secretive–little information is offered–questions if asked are evasively or inadequately answered.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He faces the mystery of emerging and evolving life.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He is also intrigued with the readiness with which these young things adapt themselves to their environment.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The chickens begin at once under the hen’s solicitous teaching, to peck and scratch the ground for food.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The goslings and ducklings almost break from the egg into the nearest water.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The young animals seek with unerring instinct to suck the life-sustaining milk prepared in their mother’s bodies.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And through and in it all is a deep maternal solicitude and protection which at times calls for a type of heroism which appeals to our sympathetic admiration.</p>
<p>In shaded corners of the barn or in an isolated shed, after choice settings of eggs are saved, some broody hen is given the task of hatching out a new addition to the flock.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As you pass this nervous prospective mother what a temptation to make a pass at her, to see her fluff her feathers and hear her angry protest, and perhaps if you are not careful you may feel the vicious peck of her sharp beak.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Then when the day came for the little chicks to appear–what excitement–how eagerly we listened for that first “cheep,” or perhaps first we saw a little head pop out from the shelter of warm feathers.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Then if we could only hold one in our hands!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>What childish delight.</p>
<p>The boy that lives about a modern farm where the hens are closely housed for feeding and laying misses much.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>On a small wood-bordered farm where the hens have the whole place to use as a range one finds unique fun and mystery. We often had to play detective when suspicious that a hen was laying away from home and planned to raise a family secretly.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She would find a quiet spot in the dense, protecting shrubbery at the edge of the woods or in a weedy fence corner.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We were given the task of watching, and after the morning feeding if we saw a hen leaving the flock we were to not e the direction and if possible trail her to her nest.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But sometimes they were successful in keeping the secret and we knew nothing until one came home proudly leading her brood.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>With the close proximity of the woods and its wild animals a hen would often be missing and sometimes never return, and occasionally all we knew was the finding of a lot of scattered feathers.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Often we would find empty egg shells in the nest–the contents having been sucked out–or perhaps one or more hens or chickens would be lying dead with the throat punctured–for weasels loved eggs and the warm blood of birds and fowl.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As I stood inside the barn door one morning I saw one of these sleek, long-bodied, small marauders creep through a hole in the wall and start down the line of hen roosts. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Becoming aware of my presence he suddenly flashed out of sight.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Over at my cousin’s we used to find these nests away back in the hidden corners of the hey-loft up under the roof of their big barn.</p>
<p>You may think a play-room in a modern house is a grand place on a rainy day but I know you would desert it any time for a big hay-loft.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>No arm boy can ever forget the peace and security of such a refuge.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A place for “hide and seek” or the supreme adventure of spending a summer night.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>On a raw, rainy day burrow in and in the clean, odorous warmth of stored-up sunshine, listen to the rain on the roof.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>These may be more technical harmony by some great orchestra but there is no music that haunts the memory like that.</p>
<p>Besides the flocks of chickens there come also the downy goslings and ducklings, and while the spring is still young and cold, new-born lambs run shivering and plaintive upon their long shaky legs–or perhaps the old mare has added a foal, a timid, gawky, lanky-legged child, which is often a most important event, or a young calf is bawling and adding its voice to the farm chorus.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And one would certainly never pass without notice–in fact we were almost dragged away–the new litter of little pigs with their vigorous little squeals.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Also there is that pride in the child’s mind due to a sense of ownership and the possession of these living things as pets and playmates.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>All this enriches his life and prepares in him attitudes that ennoble character.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>His is a world of reality.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>His playthings are not artificial and inanimate.</p>
<p>Then there is the unforgettable picture of strength, docility and patience–that of two oxen yoked together pulling a plow through new soil mellow and dark with the leaf mold of centuries–the plough share tinkling against small rocks or striking sparks on large hidden ones–hear the crack of broken roots–see the impact upon a deeply-bedded stone and the plough handles suddenly wrenched from the hands of the ploughman.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Here is the dramatic play of muscle and brawn struggling to prepare the soil tot bring forth plant and grain to sustain the life of man and beast. After days of such effort from break of dawn until the evening shadows fall–in heat, or wind, or sudden showers–one can easily imagine the tired beasts and the aching muscles of the man.</p>
<p>To keep the oxen going is usually the task of an extra man.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This driver walks beside them with a long, wand-like stick called an ox-goad, at times pointed on one end or there is inserted in the end a sharp metal like the point of a nail.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>With trained oxen it is only necessary to touch the top of the neck with the flat of the stick, but there are other drivers and other oxen who need a sharper and more painful process of urging.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In our community oxen were used very little for plowing or hauling.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Most of them, if saved beyond the calf period, were fattened at the end of two or three years and killed for meat.</p>
<p>You may be down in the field as the day’s work ends and the gentle, plodding horse which has been ploughing is now unhitched as the plough is dropped aside in the furrow and strong arms lift you up and hold you high to set you across the horse’s shoulders, where you can hold on fearfully to the hames which extend above the collar, and you ride in state up to the barn door. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>One of the important occupants of our farm yard was a large gray gender, the leader of small flock of Canadian geese.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>These are an admirable fowl, especially the male with his long, graceful, taper neck and black, riband-like stripe around it, and his small and bright eye.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was a constant temptation for children to tease him, to see his demonstration of temper.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>On one occasion a younger brother had followed mother as she went to the barn for some duty–to milk the cow or gather the eggs.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As he lingered in the yard he picked up a small stick and walked toward the gander who immediately thrust out his neck to full length and with his peculiar nasal hiss waddled to met him.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>At this advance Bob became alarmed and turned to beat a hasty retreat, but in the excitement he stumbled and fell flat on his face.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Immediately the gander was on top of him, beating him with great, strong, hard wings.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Fortunately help was near, but Bob learned that a Canadian gander has a temper and fighting spirit that is best for small boys to let alone.</p>
<p>In the late fall, ushered in by the frosty nights and cool clear days in advance of winter, came the butchering days.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This was a necessary but gruesome occasion.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The farm must supply meat for the family.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>At almost any period of the year chickens, hens or geese or perhaps a lamb or sheep would supply an immediate and temporary need, but this “fall killing” was an event, for it must supply the demands of a long winter.</p>
<p>It began with the sharpening of the knives and hatchets, and the at meat a “chore” on the grindstone.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>For the farm boy these hours are distressing memories–blistered hands–aching arms–breaking backs.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The person holding the knife, axe or other implement on the revolving stone was always unreasonable as to the speed or the edge they required and the end to be attained seemed always far away.</p>
<p>The butchering must have the right of way within the house with the women as well as the men outside.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Every kettle and pot must be filled with water and it did not stream from a faucet–it had to be drawn, hand over hand by rope or pole, by the bucket ful from a deep well.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The fires must be kept going and this demanded many a visit to the woodpile. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There must be plenty of boiling water.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Sometimes a great iron kettle was hung on a tripod outside and a fire kept under that for a convenient and additional supply.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This was especially true on hog-killing days as the carcass must be dipped in boiling water to soften the coarse hair and bristles on the hide so that it might easily be scraped clean.</p>
<p>The details of these butchering days are not at all pleasant.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The elevation of a squealing hog or bawling calf by the hind legs on a block and tackle hung in a barn door or shed, and quick slash of the knife in the throat.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Or with the steer or cow the strong swing of the axe and the dull almost sickening sound as the pole of the axe hits the animal just above and between the eyes knocking it unconscious, and again the knife stoke.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Often these acts meant tragedy to a child as he had known and loved one or more of these animals since their birth and perhaps they were playmates or pets; and we might be sent away to a neighbor’s under some excuse for the day–only to learn the tragedy later.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We often knew that a neighbor had a pig-killing, for a boy from that home would appear next morning on the school play-ground with an inflated pig’s bladder tied loose on a stick and bound around whacking everyone he could reach–reminding one of the antics of the medieval court jester who used the same thing in his clownish acts.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Part of the meat secured in these butcherings was “corned” or “salted down.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>For this corning a very strong pickle was made and it should be strong enough to float a potato.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The meat is packed in a barrel putting a quantity of salt between each layer of meat and then the pickle is poured over covering all the meat.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Both beef and pork are treated the same, the first being “corned” and the second “salted-down.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This term “corned” originated from the use of salt which was in large grains looking very much like a kernel of corn.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Even the Scotch word “pickle” means a kernel or grain.</p>
<p>Of course no farm could be complete without a dog.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Just before we left Clifton our dog, Fido, came to us.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She was a medium size, black and white with smooth hair, and was specially fine for flushing partridge.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She died but we had one of her pups named Jim.</p>
<p><span>HOME</span><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><span>FURNISHINGS</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Household equipment and furniture were very simple.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The major items were homemade.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Sometimes the only article purchased was the stove.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Fireplaces had largely gone out of use and were not built in the houses of our day.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Stoves had been invented.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>First there was the original stove, a box-like, oblong sheet metal affair with a door in one end for putting in the wood-sticks 24-36 inches long.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A stovepipe was fitted at the other end and usually extended through the roof as some houses had no chimney.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>For a time people did all their cooking on this.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Then came the stove with a built-in oven which was a remarkable improvement.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There were no fire-places in our settlement.</p>
<p>Men made their own tables.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Solid ones with square legs.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Bedsteads--the big, double kind--could be bought in the stores--regular four-posters.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But these were also homemade.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Heavy square posts with rails across at foot and head and heavy side-boards.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In between these sides were slats, set rather close together on which to lay the “tick.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Many beds had ropes netted across instead of the slats as this was flexible and more comfortable, but in use the ropes stretched and sagged in the middle.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>These side-boards were often so high the bed looked like a great box.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Into this was placed the “tick.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This word may need a little explanation.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Ticking: was a heavy, stripe, close-woven cotton material used in making a large bag-like cover the size of the bed and which was filled with oat-straw.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Often as a substitute people gathered the blossoms form a plant called “Life of Man,” a plant about 18" high and a silver color.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It grew very like a Sweet William, the blossoms spread out on top in little buttons.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>These were dried in the sun and it took a great quantity of them to make a “tick,” as this was the common name--a contraction of “ticking,” applied to both the material and its contents.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Pillow covers were made of the same material, often filled with straw but usually feathers.</p>
<p>In the parents’ bedstead the straw tick was often topped with one of goose feathers.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When you could sink down in an ample feather bed and cover up with heavy quilts one could snap his fingers at Jack Frost.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A choice wedding-gift for a young couple was a feather bed and they were so prized it was not uncommon to find them mentioned in wills and inventories.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Straw ticks were regularly shaked up and turned over to make them smooth and comfortable, but after long use the straw would break up and pulverize and then they were a lumpy mass.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The value of the feather bed was due to the long process of accumulating the necessary supply of goose feathers.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This recalls what seems a strange and rather cruel practice which gave rise to the term “live” feathers.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In the later summer a goose was caught and its head either covered with a small hood or held so it could not bite, and then the large soft feathers were plucked from its breast and under its wings.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This was done several times during the life of the goose.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>One can readily imagine how many such pluckings would be required to make one of these feather beds, and how long it would take, especially if only a small flock of geese were available.</p>
<p>We had several rather populous Indian settlements in the Province but none very near to us, so only rarely did we see any of them. When an Indian did come to us he was not at all picturesque in a native costume of skin and feathers, but dressed in any old clothes he could get--looking at times like cast-offs from the settlers.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They sod plain and fancy-colored splint baskets, also cow-hide moccasins.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They also made snow-shoes and wooden buckets, and took in exchange for any of these--potatoes, fish or whatever they needed or could get.</p>
<p>Factory straw brooms could be purchased at the stores but our men made what we called “birch-brooms” for general use, and they were especially good for rough sweeping around the house or barn.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This was made out of a round stick of yellow-birch about five feet long and five inches in diameter.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>About fifteen inches from one end begin cutting the wood with a knife in long, thin, pliable strips to about two inches from the end.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Continue this around and to the depth of the heart of the stick.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Pull all these strips down over the know and tie in a bunch with twine.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The long end of the stick is then trimmed down to a convenient size for a handle.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>One of our real necessities was candles.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There were very few lamps and kerosene oil was very expensive, costing about ninety cents a gallon.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We used a lamp so rarely that I have often said that I did not see a lamp until I left Canobie, but mother informs me that she had one--a glass hand lamp.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Every home had candle molds.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The most common type was a battery of six cylinders either in line or three by two.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>These were made of tin.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Traveling candlemakers who visited larger communities had larger sets.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The bottom of each cylinder was closed except for a hole in the center large enough to insert the wick which was carried to the top and tied to a small cross-bar and drawn tight.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Beef and mutton suet was “tried” out and mixed, and while hot was poured into these cylinders or molds, and when cooled and hard the completed candles were slipped out and laid away in a cool dry place.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The candle-wick was a soft-spun cotton thread quite thick--heavier than yarn.</p>
<p>Many types of candle-sticks were in use but all were either hand or table type.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In some poorer homes the candle might be stuck in the neck of a bottle or set up in a saucer.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Patent snuffers were rare.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Using the scissors was common and I have seen people pick the charred wick out of the flame with their fingers.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>For use out-of-doors we had a lantern made of tin with slits in it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We almost never saw wax candles and very rarely did any of our people dip their tallow candles as it was a tedious process.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Matches were already in use.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Some men still had flint and steel to start a fire.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This required a flint and steel and a tinder of some vegetable matter, usually a very dry fine moss.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When mother was young it was very common to carry hot coals from neighbors, and I saw it done in our settlement.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Having no matches and his fir gone out, a neighbor sent a boy with a pan and we scooped a quantity of hot coals out of the stove for him to take home.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Another method was by a flambeau.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This was made as follows: A long stick of soft wood, pitchy, if possible, was split two ways at one end.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Into these splits were fitted strips of birch bark and then the edge of the bark was set on fire.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In this was fire could be carried some distance.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This was also handy for hunting animals at night.</p>
<p>Our matches when we had them were made in what we called “card.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A card was a thin square of pine or spruce wood--about 2 ½ inches, the major portion being slotted into about a dozen narrow strips and the points dipped in a sulphur mixture to ignite by friction.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A small number of these cards were stacked and wrapped in paper for sale in the stores.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>One writer says that 84 imported English matches sold for 25 cents.</p>
<p>A common and necessary article in nearly every home was a boot-jack.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Every man and any boys old enough to work on the farm or in the woods wore high-top boots coming up to the knees.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>With these were worn one or tow pairs of heavy socks, perhaps cotton in summer, but wool in winter.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>For comfort these boots fitted tight about the ankle and after a day in the field or woods with swelled and perspiring feet or wet leather from rain and mud and melting snow, these boots were so tight that it was no easy matter to remove them.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>To ease this task a boot-jack was devised.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This was a board about 18 or 20 inches long, into one end of which was made a deep V-shaped cut large enough to insert the boot heel about even with the ankle.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The board was blocked underneath so that this V-shaped end was raised at an angle off the floor.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In pulling off the boot the heel was placed in the V-cut and the other foot was placed on the back end of the board to hold it rigid, and then by a steady pull the foot was drawn from the boot. The action was then repeated for the other foot.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>When the boot-jack was absent another simple method was resorted to.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Some member of the family backed up to the person wishing their boots removed and pulled the foot up between his legs and with his hands clasped tightly on the back upper heel pulled off the boot.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Sometimes this created ludicrous scenes for if the boot was tight the wearer, for assistance, would push hard upon the back of the puller with his other foot and if the boot suddenly loosened he would, if not careful loose his balance, stumble across the room and sometimes land flat on his face with the boot in his arms.</p>
<p>On many a porch either front or back, sometimes both, one saw the beautiful couch shells, their conical exterior covered with miniature horn-like projections, and the flaring long mouth softly smooth as an infant’s skin and shaded a delicate pink--serving several useful purposes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It might be as a door-stop of porch ornament but often it was used as a horn to call the men from the fields.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>To fit it for such a use it was only necessary to cut off the tip of the pyramidal horn at the large end of the shell thus making an opening into its inner chamber, and when you learned, you could by blowing into this opening produce a mellow, pleasing call which easily floated out to the near limits of the small farms.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In them also was romance and mystery.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It meant that ships and sailors had come form the far West Indies, and if you lifted the shell to your ear you heard the soft murmur of the stored echoes of the Tropic seas.</p>
<p>Clocks and watches were not generally to be found.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Some homes had neither one. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A few people had watches of English make. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Our own clock was a Gothic pointed-type case painted red, about eight inches wide and ten inches high and three inches thick and had brass works.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My grandfather Henry owned a clock with wooden works.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>These were interesting time pieces and it is remarkable that they were so efficient.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The making of clocks in America has a fascinating history.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Those brought from Europe had brass works and as each part was cast the clocks were expensive.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>To supply a cheaper article early in 1800 men in Connecticut began making clocks with wood works and they dominated the market for about twenty-five years until sheet brass became available when the parts were stamped out. Many were sold by peddlers in both the Maritime Provinces and Canada.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A note from Moore’s “Old Clock Book” regarding these first wood clocks is informing: “They would begin one or two dozen at a time, using no machinery but cutting the wheels and teeth with a saw and jack-knife.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They were first marked out with a square and compasses and then sawed with a fine saw--a very slow process.”</p>
<p>When we speak of the lack of clocks and watches it may at first seem strange but it is well to realize that we were living in a world unregulated by hours and minutes. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Working time was daylight to dark an duties often demanded a service in the margin before and after.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Each season might allow or demand a short or a long day.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Time did not matter--work did, and a man could watch the sun whose position was all that was necessary.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Sun-up” and “high-noon” and “candle-lightin’ time” were the important hours--the first with its call form sleep--the second the dinner call that drew the men from the field--and the last calling form the twilight shadows into the light and shelter of the house, but not always to an immediate rest.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Evening chores still waited or there were repairs to equipment or tools that the labor of the morrow might not be delayed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There was little need of looking at the face of a clock for such days as these.</p>
<p>School was the one and only thing that demanded regularity as to time.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There was nothing else--no church--no meetings.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A writer who visited this country almost 90 years ago says:</p>
<p>“There was no blowin’ time there, you may depend.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We plowed all the fall, for dear life; in winter we thrashed, made and mended tools, went to market and mill, and got out our firewood and drails.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As soon as frost was gone, came sowin’ and plantin,’ and weedin’ and hoein’--then harvest and spreadin’ comfort–then gatherin- manure, fencin’ and ditchin’-- and then turn to and face plowin’ again.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It all went round like a wheel without stoppin,’ and so fast, I guess you couldn’t see the spokes, just one long everlastin’ stroke from July to eternity, without time to look back on the tracks.”</p>

<p><span>FOOD</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Living in such close proximity to a bay and ocean teeming with fish, our table could be supplied at all seasons with a variety--salmon, cod-fish, hake, mackerel, herring, lobsters, smelts, haddock, cusk and shad.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Added to the fresh fish was the seasonable fish roe (caviear) especially that of the salmon, considered tot be a choice delicacy on any modern table--to us it denoted neither luxury nor affluence.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Several varieties like cod and haddock were dressed, salted, and dried and became a staple article for any season of the year.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Herring were smoked.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Mackerel were packed in brine--and fresh mackerel with boiled potatoes made a choice meal.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Altogether, here was nature’s supply for every daily need and with bread, and potatoes and a few other vegetables no family need go hungry.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was well that such a supply was available as otherwise the food needed was so far away and the means of transportation so uncertain that it could not be safely depended upon.</p>
<p>These local native supplies were the salvation of the settlements and means of continuation and advancement of the provincial life of America.</p>
<p>Gardens were most informal.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They combined utility and beauty.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was an index of pride and satisfied the hunger of the women of the house for beauty, and oddities in plant life.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Here would be found apple and plum trees which themselves or their immediate ancestors came form the old country, and gathered at their feet down the beaten garden paths would be those flowers which also crossed the water to impart their familiar perfume and recall old garden walks and loved memories.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It would be an interesting and pleasurable venture to trace each of these plants and shrubs to their former home for they too had come as emigrants to a new world, and like their owners, in a new environment were transformed into new types--developing new and surprising characteristics.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Here also were the currant and gooseberry bushes whose fruit added a piquancy to the homely fare.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The morning and evening air were heavy with the odor of mint and musk and old-fashioned roses.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In small buds or bordering the walks were the deep-orange marigolds.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There was “Ladies’ Delight,” our common Pansies. They have a score of names through the centuries.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Shakespeare called them “Love-In-Idleness.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Rose bushes, short or tall--the moss and the common kind, and most attractive of all the musk-rose.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In a sunny corner a tangled wild pink rose, called by some the briar or dog-rose. Ribbon or striped grass.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Groups of stately tiger lilies, orange-colored with black spots. In a cool corner spearmint that you always want to pluck and crush in your fingers.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Here and there a yellow evening primrose.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Perhaps a sunflower or two, and nearly always the tall holly-hocks with their blossomed stalks, the delight of bee and humming-bird.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And hiding in some shady spot underneath the heavy foliage a warty toad watches for unwary flies and bugs.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The odors of these old gardens still linger and recall the gentle, simple hearts of a dreamy long ago.</p>
<p>In a neighbor’s garden was a tomato plant-the “love- apple.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was a long way from its home in South America.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>To us it was poisonous, and its fruit could not be eaten.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was just a garden curiosity.</p>
<p>Our great fruit garden was the big out-doors.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Wild strawberries, blueberries in the open stump-land, and wild red raspberries were plentiful in burnt-over ground.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Of these many of our people made choice preserves.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A few bog-cranberries could be found and some, not many, high-bush cranberries grew in the fence corner in the pasture at Tim Savage’s, our next neighbor.</p>
<p>Orchards were absent.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In some gardens there were purple plums, and apple trees and crab-apples.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Our apples were neither plentiful nor choice.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I have before me a recent picture of two apple trees, part of a planting made by my mother near the old log-house.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They were sour crabs.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They are now about sixty-five years old and still blossom but bear no fruit.</p>
<p>Not every family had a churn.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Some had little use for it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>With a large and growing family there was rarely a surplus of milk unless one was prosperous enough to own a sufficient number of cows.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And this meant prosperity, as there was first the cost of the cows and then the feed through long winter.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Living close to the lines of need, a family with one cow had to count on a part of the year in which the cow gave little milk or none.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If a female calf was born it might mean an economic impossibility to keep it until it was a producer--so it would be traded for some more immediate necessity.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If it was a male it might at an early age be slaughtered to supply necessary fresh meat, or if strong and vigorous it might be saved to become a valuable beast of burden--for in many sections oxen turned most of the virgin soil.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A pair of good oxen was the early settler’s choice possession.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I have seen monuments of appreciation of many kinds in bronze and stone in both Europe and America, but never have I seen one for this patient, faithful, strong beast who cleared the ground and rove and mellowed the soil that man might eat the harvest.</p>
<p>In most homes there was a churning--day and butter-making could be a choice art.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It began with the care of the milk and this was kept without the use of ice, for we had no thought of the storage of ice to temper the hot days and preserve food.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>So the milk was set away down in the spring house or in a prepared earth cellar for the cream to rise.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The cream was then skimmed from the shallow, stone-ware bowls or tin pans, which when emptied must be scoured and scalded and set out in the sun to dry.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Then the soured cream accumulated over a number of days, is put in the tall dasher-churn and the real work begins.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>With what anxiety and impatience we watched for the first flakes of butter.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>These flakes and lumps are at last strained or dipped out and kneaded into dry creamy whiteness.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This careful kneading is the mark of a prideful housewife.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And, oh, the residue--that tangy buttermilk with its globules of butter too small to be considered by the churner or perhaps she had in mind her family and the enjoyment they would get form that extra richness. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>What a heritage of healthful food and drink cows have added to life in all ages.</p>
<p>To a boyish appetite a good substitute for butter was the cold fatty juice of roast beef.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When cooled it solidified into a grayish-whit paste rich in food value and with its delicate meaty flavor added much to a great slice of home-made bread.</p>
<p>A food novelty and what might be considered a delicacy was milk curds.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This was made form “beestings, “ the name given to the first milk from a cow after calving.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As it was not considered fit for human consumption many people fed these first milkings to the pigs.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But form pagan times the Irish and taken this milk and made of it a popular food–It is heated until it becomes thick curds, and these have a pleasant sweet taste and are light and easily digested.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Such a food was very welcome whenever we had a fresh cow and we are grateful to the Irish people that they brought the custom with them across the water.</p>
<p>Among the things our young settlement did not have was bee-hives.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Bee-culture was well established in many sections of America and in some of the more advanced communities of the Province.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Bees are apparently not native to America and it is said the English people brought them.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Some Indians called the “English Flies.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Longfellow places bee-hives in the Acadian village of Grande-pre. On a very rare occasion a hive of wild bees would be found.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Someone one day found a hive in a hollow cedar fence rail near Sealy’s and obtained quite a supply of choice wild honey.</p>
<p>Farm products supplied a limited variety for the table and the menus were noted more for their quantity. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Besides the meat and fowl from the farm-yard there were turnips, carrots, potatoes, beans, peas, beets, cabbage, cucumbers, pumpkins and parsnips.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Dried fish and seasonable fresh fish from Bay Chaleur.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Corn meal for porridge and johnny-cake, whole-wheat flour for bread–and this was really whole-wheat.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I do not recall seeing white wheat flour, which was quite expensive.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>On account of the large Scotch population oat-meal “porritch” naturally came to be a common breakfast food and if one did not feel very well or was convalescent he might have the luxury of oat-meal gruel, so desirable a child might be tempted to think he was sick.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The popularity of oats was also due to the fact that for some years the Provincial wheat crop had failed and people could not afford the price of the imported flour.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>So they tried out the virtues of their own oats.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>To encourage this the government subsidized oat-meal mills all over the Province.</p>
<p>A very common but acceptable meat dish in the winter was rabbit stew.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>These beautiful, clean young animals looking like virgin snow in mid-winter were easily caught.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They had fattened on the birch-berries and other tender growths of shrubbery and were delicately tender.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When stewed in a great pot with potatoes and carrots and turnips they left little to be desired in satisfying a boy’s appetite.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Wild partridge , of which there were many in our woods, furnished many a meal and were both roasted and stewed. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Hens and chickens were too valuable to become common diet.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>On some special occasion we might have a roast goose stuffed with potatoes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Goose eggs were seldom eaten, as they had a strong taste which many people did not like and also the eggs were more valuable for hatching as geese were necessary for food but even more in demand for their feathers.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Fruit such as apples etc. was a scarce almost non-existent article and it may be difficult, if not impossible, for a modern to understand the satisfaction of a raw sweet turnip, or carrot.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Often these were stored in a pit in the field.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A shallow pit was dug and the carrots or turnips dumped in and then covered over with loose straw and this covered with earth.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This was an excellent protection against the frost and yet they were easily accessible.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Scrape away some dirt, brush aside the straw and draw out a juicy vegetable–we took our vitamins raw and liked it.</p>
<p>White wheat flour which came form the States was packed in barrels weighing 196 lbs. Or in bags, eight of these equaling a barrel.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The price was $12.00-$14.00 per barrel.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Fourteen pounds could be purchased for $1.00. Our regular wheat flour was ground form home-grown wheat in local mills and when baked the bread was very dark as most of the grain was retained and not refined to modern whiteness.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In New England people used to mix other flours like rye, buckwheat or corn meal with this wheat flour but this was not a custom with us.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>On account of the high cost of sugar very few pies were made, except pumpkin and wild strawberry, but when made were usually sweetened with molasses.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I have no remembrance of pie or cake.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But real New Orleans molasses could make an appetizing “piece” our of a slice of bread or a square of johnny cake--it even tasted good on thick hot oatmeal porridge, for it was not always, but only rarely that we could have oatmeal and milk, never cream.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Or try it sometime with maple sugar, dropping in small broken pieces and waiting until they melt.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Our porridge was not soupy but cooked long and thick and the grain was a cut, not crushed, in flakes.</p>
<p>Bread baking day was an event. The aroma from that hot bread was an invitation to any appetite and the bread was strength and life.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was such bread as this that became the symbol of vitality in religious phraseology centuries ago.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was truly “the staff of life.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A thick slice of that dark bread with its heavy crust, spread with new butter or butter and brown sugar or molasses was a satisfying repast to allay any between-meal hunger in a growing boy. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Buckwheat which was successfully grown on the poorer upland soil, was a most favored crop. It never failed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is highly nutritive and was a very popular food grain. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Buckwheat bread was baked in large flat pans about the same as johnnycake.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Some people in the Province mixed it with barley or rye.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The most common and desirable use of buckwheat was in thin hot cakes called pan-cakes and eaten with butter, molasses or maple syrup.</p>
<p>Shelled or “pot barley,” which was barley especially treated in the mill for removal of the hard outer shell, was much used for soups.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There is a vast difference between barley soup and souped barley.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>To anyone who likes homegrown and harvested barley, and most country boys do, it was a satisfaction to dip a spoon into a bowl of soup and take up a good supply of barley and<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>a little juice, just enough to moisten it and carry the taste of the meat which was boiled in it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This grain was also used for a pudding made and served much like rice.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was also ground for flour.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Barley cakes were baked in the oven and eaten hot with butter.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I have heard it said, “There is nothing in a name.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I wonder if this is true?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This question comes to mind as I think of “dough-boys.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In these modern days we call them “dumplings,” but I must assert that I have never tasted a dumpling that had the qualify of the “dough-boys” that came from the pot on mother’s stove.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They were big lumps of dough cooked to a dry spongy lightness with a piece of boiling beef or salt pork; served hot and broken apart with a fork and then spread with pure New Orleans molasses it made a repast to linger in boy’s memory.</p>
<p>Is it possible that memory puts halos around the common things of the past?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It may be. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Or is it the appetite of growing boyhood that is glad of anything to eat.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This may also be.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But I am inclined to think that our present thoughts are not rooted altogether in self-deception.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>At least I am willing still to believe that there was some magic in the mixture or in the cooking that produced a satisfying excellence--that it is a pleasure to remember.</p>
<p>While corn was not grown in our settlement much was raised elsewhere in the Province and corn meal was always to be found on sale in the stores.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was much used as food.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There was porridge or pancakes for breakfast, then for dinner or supper there was johnny-cake and also at times a thin flat cake baked on top to the stove.</p>
<p>It is probably true that if the average person was asked to spell johnny-cake he would use a capital “J.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is really “journey-cake” and the name is very appropriate as it is so quickly made.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This was the popular hot bread in all pioneer American homes and it still retains its popularity on the modern table.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is a cake baked in the oven in a large flat pa n and made of corn meal mixed with water, milk, eggs, etc.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>What we liked was the corner pieces where we had more corners in it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In a large family of children here was something to fuss about. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Our not growing corn, and therefore not having it in the variety of uses to which the American Indian had for centuries put the whole grain denied us many attractive dishes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We knew nothing of roasting ears, parched corn, succotash, or hominy.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That we did not grow corn was due either to the fact that our land was too new or because our people were not familiar with its culture.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>After reading scattered records of the origin of corn in some section of south America and its history and the vital part which it played in the early colonization of the Americas, I am constrained to remark that I am more than surprised that an article of such importance and accompanied with such romance has not inspired some writer to add a great and glowing epic to our American literature.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Longfellow and Whittier touched a chapter in it but no writer has essayed the whole subject.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>No man knows what the original plant was like.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Its early evolution is lost in far centuries, and its history is adorned with legend, religious ritual, and romance.</p>
<p>In addition to this the American Indian made a number of valuable contributions to the white man such as their invention of the snow-shoe and the birch canoe--one to conquer the winter snow and the other to follow the waterways.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was the cause of much surprise to me that no writer has yet compiled the facts regarding the full contribution which the Indian made to our original settlers all over both Americas.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>An examination of this subject I am sure would reveal that the story of the settlement of the western world would be much different than it is if the Indian had not given of his foods and inventions.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A worth while story waits the telling.</p>
<p>Our most plentiful and dependable food staple was the so-called Irish potato. Our soil gave munificent returns.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They were a part of every substantial meal, even at times mixed with flour to make bread.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is interesting that this plant, native in South America, and cultivated for many centuries should have such a modern romantic history.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Europeans first became definitely familiar with them when Sir Richard Grenville, seized a cargo of them in a captured Spanish vessel in the Atlantic late in the 16<sup>th</sup> century and took them to Ireland and England.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>England did some experimenting.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>France accepted them as a curiosity and ignored their food value.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Ireland in its poverty, adopted them and they became its most important food, definitely affecting their history for more than a century, and with the Irish immigrant they came back to America early in the 18<sup>th</sup> century with the name of the Irish permanently attached.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>This was the supply of food which our farms and gardens, rivers, and ocean brought to us in return for our time and labor, and as it was usually plentiful one can readily visualize what our usual meals were like--their variety and palatableness depending of course upon the cook.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But always the important thing was to lad the table with plenty.</p>
<p>All British people brought with them the habit of tea-drinking and it was almost universally black tea.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>For women neighbors who “dropped in” and on all occasions black tea was the customary drink.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It cost about fifty cents a pound.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Green tea, being more expensive, was little used.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was the common practice to serve it piping hot and if too hot it was poured from the cup into the saucer and after a blowing, sometimes vociferous and uncouth, it was soon cooled to a bearable temperature and drunk directly out of the saucer.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A change in manners has tabooed this habit. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The picture still remains of men with long moustaches and full whiskers pouring our hot tea, noisily blowing it and then picking up the generous saucer in both hands, closing the lips over the edge and drinking the contents, sometimes gustily as fast as the hot liquid will allow.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Faring off into the saucer, like submerged sea-weed, was the moustache, and when the saucer was put down the wet hairs were drawn or pushed into the mouth to be sucked dry and if still damp a hand was passed over the mouth and then rubbed dry on the pant leg.</p>
<p>For tea we had several substitutes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Leaves from wild raspberry bushes and the teaberry (checkerberry or wintergreen) were gathered and dried and steeped the same as the tea leaf.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Coffee was occasionally to be secured.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In our home we never had it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Our “coffee” was slices of our black bread toasted to almost a charcoal on the top of the stove and then broken into small pieces and steeped in the tea-pot.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This bread was so full of all the natural elements of the grain that it made a surprisingly satisfactory hot drink especially with a little milk, and brown or maple sugar sweetening.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It gave a beverage very like modern “Postum.”</p>
<p>Aware of old country drinking habits it is interesting to call attention to the effect of a new environment upon our people.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Our abundant waters in stream and well meant more than casually appears.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>These early pioneers and come form countries where tea and liquors of many kinds were the only liquids used.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Here in America liquors were more expensive and more difficult to obtain and the people learned to drink water which they had habitually refrained from doing on account of the impure and unpalatable supply in their home lands.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>These limpid, rippling waters held from us a constant source of refreshment and we stooped to drink without hesitation, without thought of germs or pollution--germs were things unknown and civilization was still too far away with its off-scourings and impurities.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The development of this new habit was to make a real transformation in character for many.</p>
<p>We had both white and brown sugar.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The brown was in bulk in barrels.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The white, not very common, was in square lumps.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Molasses came to the stores in barrels and was retailed by pint, quart or gallon.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Spices obtainable were all-spice, whole cloves, whole nutmeg, whole pepper.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>These last three were grated or ground as needed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Salt was coarse grained.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Sage was grown in the gardens and used as a seasoning.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Thyme also.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>These two herbs have an almost continuous history as medicine in nearly all countries from earliest times but were not used by our people except for food seasoning.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Starch, so much in use for the many feminine garments, was made from grated potato.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Yeast was usually made from hops, the necessary supply being grown each summer.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The hops were picked from the vine and dried and stored away.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As needed they were boiled and the juice strained off.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Fresh yeast was made by taking the necessary quantity of this juice and adding a little old yeast to start the fermentation.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A yeast was also made form the pale-yellow moss found on the maple tree.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This was boiled and the juice strained off and sweetened with molasses and set aside to ferment.</p>
<p>In calling to mind this limited variety of simple foods it is well to remember the most important condition.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The great appetizer was natural hunger, the accompaniment of good health and developed by constant outdoor activities.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>So it was not at all necessary for the cooks of our day to resort to refined or fancy cooking.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They were always assured that a generous supply of plain food would on all occasions be acceptable and satisfying.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There was also the additional fact that as each family sat down to eat, the great bulk of the food upon the table came out of their own fields and gardens and represented the results of their own thought and labor.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>So whatever excellence there was in the quality made it double enjoyable.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If a man had intelligently and diligently labored nature had generously rewarded him.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><span>HOME</span> <span>OCCUPATIONS</span> <span>&amp;</span> <span>SOCIAL</span> <span>LIFE</span></p>
<p>The simple life has its moments of pride.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Always a woman handy with her needle of who makes the most colorful hooked rugs, another whose butter is praised, or one who is a bread-maker par excellence (the odor of a modern baker’s shop is not the same as this woman’s kitchen on baking day), and another is praised for her bleached white floors.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>To a modern these are such simple things but in my boyhood days they made demands upon the highest intelligence, and meant long hours of exhaustive labor. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>From this drudgery there was occasional relief.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The usual social gathering was that of a few women who would drop in on some neighbor with their knitting for a “bit of talk” over a “cup o’tay”; or the Sabbath afternoon visiting, when the women would sit around and talk about their babies, their quilts, their weaving, or any one of those subjects dear to the heart of the housewife.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Of course it might be that some choice morsel of gossip was going the rounds with the usual whisperings and knowing looks.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The men, weather permitting, sat out on the wood-pile talking crops or politics, or leaned over the barnyard fence to discuss the weather, some new addition to the livestock or their problems of soil or harvest.</p>
<p>Also we had our “Windows in Thrums” where sharp-eyed women, and men also, guessed at the household happenings of their neighbors.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In an isolated community getting irregular mail from a post-office six miles away through a neighbor, a few newspapers from Saint John coming once a week and read and passed around, it is easy to see how even the smallest happening would be raised to real event.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is truly a misfortune that there is no record of the tall tales swapped over a pipe of “baccy” and a social drink; and if anything could be more important, we should have some transcript of the heated arguments over religion, school, or politics, redolent with naive expressions and idioms and colloquialisms, long dead, expressed with varying brogues, which can never be reproduced.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We had our “characters” who added by their oddities a piquancy to our rather commonplace experiences.</p>
<p>Men quite generally used tobacco, either chewing or smoking or both.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The smoker had an interesting technique.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Tobacco came in the form of a hard cake at times called a “plug” or more commonly a “fig.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The pipe was of long-stemmed white clay, familiarly called a T.D., probably because a large manufacturer had these letters in raised type on the bowl.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Wishing to smoke, a man opened his jack-knife and then taking the plug expertly between the fore-finger and thumb of his left hand he trimmed off thin slices or shreds that fell into the palm below.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Then closing the knife and dropping it and the plug in his pocket, with his closed right fist he rolled, untwisted and pulverized the cut tobacco and filled his pipe, pressing the contents tight into the bowl.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He might have a match to light it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If near a stove he would reach into the wood-box and pick up a sliver of wood, thrust it into the coals until it blazed, or it was a common sight to see him reach for a hot coal and with a quick movement lift it in his fingers and lay it on the tobacco pressing it down and puffing hard to create a draft and secure ignition.</p>
<p>In the lull of the pressing duties of preparing food, women’s hands were ever busy with the needle in the making of all kinds of clothing as little was bought, and if she did sit down to visit or wait upon a baking or a boiling there was always the unfinished knitting–the socks, mittens and scarfs.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The click and flash of knitting needles is an indelible memory.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>One of the important social activities was the quilting.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>While some found special satisfaction in the lighter weights with fancy stitches and designs the necessary demand was for the heavy padded quilt so essential to cold weather comfort.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>First there was the task of cutting and piecing any available remnants of material, often of various sizes, shaped and colors to be sewed into a whole top.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Or if there was choice of material, pieced squares would be assembled and arranged in a variety of designs.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In all of this if there were girls in the house they were drafted into service and they had little chance with this and daily dish-washing and scouring and scrubbing to indulge in the luxury of idle hands which in that day was considered wasteful if not almost sinful.</p>
<p>When the actual quilting day came it was a social affair for a group of women.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Some younger ones brought their babies or young children not yet old enough to go to school, and it is easy to imagine how may interruptions such a group would cause.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It would be pleasant if we could go back to hear<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>the older mothers and grandmothers counsel the younger ones regarding health and discipline, or revive their common talk of the success or failure of their last baking or of some new preserve–all of which would now make strange reading for us of this modern age.</p>
<p>Into the quilting frame would be set the lining usually of white cotton cloth and then a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>filling was set in.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The preparation of this filling was a real task.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There were no rolls of cotton which could in a few moments be spread over this lining.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Practically raw cotton could be purchased by the pound in the stores and this was carded by hand, in most instances, the same as with wool for spinning, except that instead of being set in rolls it was lifted from the cards in sheets and laid on the lining until it was completely covered.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Sometimes instead of this cotton or wool filling an old blanket might be used.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The pieced top was then laid on and the whole cross-stitched and bound at the edges–a fluffy covering to challenge the coldest nights.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Many hands made a short task of the innumerable stitches which to one busy woman would have been a long and wearying duty.</p>
<p>Other events created opportunities of cooperation and were the occasion for companionship and sociability.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There was the “Raising.” This very often was in connection with the house of a newly-wed couple, or a family about to elevate itself from a log cabin to a frame house.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>For perhaps weeks carpenters were busy preparing the frame timbers, and then on a day all the men would gather at the place, the frames would e nailed together and set up and often before the day ended the house would be completely roofed and boarded in.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A few days of such group labor and the new home would be almost ready for occupancy.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>During these days the women would come with food and when the house had become a home the family showed its appreciation by a “house-warming,”which was a thrilling community party. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>There was a “Berrying,”–Days, usually Saturday, when the older boys and girls took their buckets and a lunch out to the berry patches.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>At the close of the day they got together and divided the picking.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If certain boys and girls drifted together it was only natural–and many a later “courting” had its beginning. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Occasionally there was a “Bee,” when men would get together to clear a piece of ground that a neighbor might begin a “clearing” and have a space for a house.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Or they would get together to get out their winter’s wood.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In all these acts the community experiences acquaintance, sympathy and solidarity.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>As a rule there was a sincere social consciousness on the part of relations in caring for their people, but at times persons did become a charge upon the community.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As a solution a rather unique system was adopted.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>At times it might be a man or woman, or a husband and wife or perhaps children were involved. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>On a town meeting day or other convenient occasion the person or persons were brought forward and an auction was held.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A farmer might need a man and wife–or only a man, and another a woman and the dependent might still be able to work; so each individual or pair was auctioned off by the community to some person who was the lowest bidder and the town obligated itself to pay the bidder the amount agreed and the bidder was obliged to furnish food, clothing and shelter.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In the case of children they were “bound out” for a definite period, usually long enough so that the child would become mature enough to render adequate service to pay for its “keep.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>At times this would hold them into their early twenties as very often hard bargains were made.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The system had in it elements of modified slavery, and was the source of many abuses and domestic tragedies. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Boys and girls both suffered cruelly from brutal masters and mistresses, and there were many runaways.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In some communities a “bound-out” boy or girl suffered a certain social ostracism.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>At times the picture was brightened by kind masters and occasionally a happy romance with a son or daughter of the family.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A writer of the period tells of attending a meeting where a man and wife were auctioned to different masters, the price set on the man being six shillings a week. Apparently no provision was made for the person to receive any wage, and additional remuneration depending entirely upon the kindness of the master. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Music was a thing practically unknown.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Of musical instruments, I never saw but three.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Often I sat in Stevens’ barn entranced with the music of the Jew’s-harp as played by my cousin Henry.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If he played any tunes I do not know what they were or where he got them.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I was satisfied if he made a continued series of sounds improvising his own melody.</p>
<p>One night some of us boys went down to Knowles’.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We heard that a hand-organ man had come and was staying there for the night.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Here was the high tide of entertainment.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We sat thrilled while the little dark-skinned man repeated his program over and over.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The night was all too short.</p>
<p>Then there was a night at Knowles’ again when Milton sang.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He had a good voice.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He had a book with the words in it but no notes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I do not think he knew anything about notes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I have no remembrance of what the songs were, except that they were old hymns.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I never knew where he learned the tunes and did not know if they were right or wrong.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>To me it was music.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He was the only person in the community I ever heard attempt to sing.</p>
<p>Then there was a country dance at my Uncle Steven’s. Everybody came, the parents with all their children--even the babies.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Two fiddlers played.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Someone called the movements.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The dancing was vigorous and carefree.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>To a small boy it was exciting to watch rough young farmers hug their buxom partners to them and picking them clear off the floor, swing them until their hooped petticoats and dresses arched out like balloons and exposed their ample legs.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When they swung their partners they swung them.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The men would stray out of the house at times to patronize a bottle which someone usually had in a hip-pocket.</p>
<p>Two types of rugs supplied the common covering for floors.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>One, and the more common, was the hooked rug and the other the woven rug.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The hooked or drawn rug equipment consisted of a four slat collapsible and adjustable frame like the quilting frame, into which was strung a square or oblong piece of coarse burlap drawn tight, or which if a pattern was desired it was outlined with chalk or charcoal.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>For general utility no pattern was attempted.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Several styles of steel hooks were necessary.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>These were short steel shafts at times slightly curved with a notched hook like a crochet needle.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This shaft was inserted in a short wooden handle. There were generally homemade.</p>
<p>The rag strips about a half inch or more in width were usually the remains of worn or cast-off clothing of varying materials.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In making the common rug a pile of these cut strips would be laid upon the burlap within easy reach and a strip picked up indiscriminately and hooked in.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The process of hooking required both hands.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The left hand held the strip in place under the burlap.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The right hand forced the hook through the burlap and caught a loop in the strip of cloth and drew it back above the surface usually about three-eights of an inch.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This action continued until the strip was all drawn.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The short ends of the strips were left underneath until the rug was finished when they were trimmed even with the hooked surface.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>On the floor it was difficult in a well-made rug to note any difference in the two sides.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If a definite color scheme was desired was usually necessary to have a dyeing day.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This required time and patience, and labor with dye kettles over a hot stove in the kitchen or often in a great iron pot hung over an outside fire.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Some of these rugs were beautifully designed and executed showing flower groupings--leaves, and human and animal figures.</p>
<p>Carpets were woven on the loom.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Old rags were cut in strips about one-half inch wide and stitched together in a continuous string and rolled into a big ball.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The spinning-wheel was used to put a twist in the string.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A bobbin was filled with a section of this rag strip and it was set in a shuttle and woven together with a cotton warp.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Strips of this weaving were sewed together to make a complete carpet, or smaller sections were used for rugs.</p>
<p>With the hooked rug three or four people could sometimes work at the same time and often the boys and girls of the household were taught how to do it and it occupied many a leisure hour. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The most clinging memories of our home activities linger around the spinning and weaving.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is difficult and perhaps not necessary to try to describe the spinning well and the loom.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They were features of nearly every farmhouse and there was seldom a time during the winter when the sound of either one was not heard.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Their use was a real home industry.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>While the whole process of spinning is a very definite memory, I have freely drawn upon the wording of the description given by Alice Morse Earle.</p>
<p>The process began with the shearing of the sheep in the early spring after the lambing season.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The wool was carefully washed and dried.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This done the first duty was the carding.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Before carding the wool was greased with rope oil or hog grease, about three pounds of grease to two pounds of wool.</p>
<p>Wool cards were rectangular pieces of thin board (about 5 x 12 inches) with a straight handle fastened on the back at the side.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>On this board was fastened a smaller rectangle of stiff leather, set thick with slightly bent wire teeth, like a coarse brush (teeth were about 1/4 inch long).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The carder took one card with her left hand, and resting it on her knee, drew a tuft of wool across it several times, until a sufficient quantity of fibre had been caught upon the wire teeth.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She then drew the second wool-card across the first several times, until the fibers were brushed parallel.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Then by a deft and catchy motion the wool was rolled or carded into small fleecy rolls, a little larger than a finger, which were then ready for spinning.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>These rolls were laid aside in horizontal piles.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The whole family easily found occupation in this vital home industry, and I recall spending many hours at this light but rather monotonous task.</p>
<p>Wool spinning was truly one of the most flexible and alert series of movements in the world, and to its varied and graceful poises our grandmothers may owe part of the dignity of carriage that was so characteristic of them. The spinner stood, leaning slightly forward, lightly poised on the ball of he left foot; with her left hand she picked up from the platform of the wheel a long slender roll of the soft carded wool, and deftly wound the end of the fibers on the point of the spindle.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She then gave a gentle motion to the wheel with a wooden peg held in her right hand, and with the left seized the roll at exactly the right distance form the spindle to allow one “drawing.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>With the hum of the wheel she stepped backward quickly one, two, three steps holding high the long yarn as it twisted and quivered, then suddenly she glided forward and let the yarn wind onto the spindle.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The gentle drawing motion and the twist of the rapidly revolving spindle results in a compact thread called yarn.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Six skeins of yarn a day was counted a good day’s work, in doing which the spinner walked over twenty miles.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The wooden peg held by the spinner served the purpose of an elongated finger and was called a driver.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was about nine inches long, an inch or so in diameter; and at about an inch from the end was slightly grooved in order that it might surely catch the spoke and thus propel the wheel.</p>
<p>For knitting, this yarn was used in its natural colors either clear white or the grey which resulted when black and white wool was mixed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If other colors were desired for knitting or weaving the yarn itself was dyed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The variety of colors with us was very simple as our native dye materials were quite limited.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Log-wood, which came ground up like coarse sawdust, mixed with coppers produced a black.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Hemlock bark, used also in tanning, made a tan color, as did also the alder bark.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Redwood and alum produced red.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Our common blues came by use of Indigo.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Golden-rod made yellow.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The blossoms were picked and steeped for the yellow juice.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This golden-rod juice mixed with indigo made a beautiful green.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>All these colors were “set” either by dipping in salt or alum water.</p>
<p>This dyeing was a tedious process, and was generally done out of doors, the color being mixed in a great kettle over an open fire.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The dyed material was lifted out of the boiling liquid with a long stick and often plunged first into cold water which gave it a partial “set” and then it was dipped in the alum solution or salt water to make the color “fast.”</p>
<p>A description of weaving, which is a rather complicated process is not all easy especially if the reader is entirely unfamiliar with it so I will refrain from attempting it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is more ancient than recorded history and strange to say the earliest operation differs little in technique from what it is today.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Its value fixed it as a permanent industry in the history of human civilization.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It has enriched our language with some of its most beautiful figures of speech.</p>
<p>Many expert weavers came from both Scotland and Ireland.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>One of our neighbors, a Scotchman, made his own loom as did practically all our people, as they were familiar with it in the old country.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He temporarily moved away from the settlement and we borrowed his loom and set it up in a corner of our kitchen.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I can still hear the swish of the shuttle as it was thrown across the warp and the immediately following thud of the beam as it packed down the woof.</p>
<p>Here was an unforgettable experience.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There on the little farm we raised the sheep and the lambs, and the wool was shorn.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In the house we carded it, mother spun it on the big spinning-wheel, and she wove the yarn into cloth, our familiar “home-spun.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This she cut and made into clothing for her family.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>So we were clothed and the needle, thread and buttons were probably the only articles that came form outside the farm.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The frugality and industry of such a woman was well-known to the writer of the familiar “Book of Proverbs.” <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p>A common woven article was Scotch and Irish plaids.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>An occasional family, still holding to old country habits, grew flax and spun and wove their linen. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The home-woven woolen cloth was uneven in texture and in some spots quite thin.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The fulling-mill, by pounding the cloth with a large oaken mallet while it was kept thoroughly wet in warm soapy water, shrunk the fibers of the cloth together and after drying made of it a much better and more practical article.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>To the fulling-mill, weavers brought their cloth just as they brought their grain to the grist mill, in fact these mills were usually combined and might even be joined to a saw-mill all under one proprietor.</p>
<p>Another occupation familiar to our home life was the periodical soap-making.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>All refuse grease from cooking, butchering, etc. was carefully saved, also the hard-wood ashes from the stoves.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The first operation was to make the lye.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>For this a stout wood barrel was needed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A slot or hole was cut through the side near the bottom.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was then placed on a solid wood or rock foundation at a slight tilt.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was filled with ashes and water was poured in till the lye trickled or “leached” from the opening.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This lye was caught in a small tub or bucket.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The ashes were frequently changed to make a new supply of lye.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The strength of the lye is important and sometimes it was necessary to pour it back over fresh ashes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The test of strength was made by dropping in an egg or potato and if a small portion of either appeared above the surface it was all right.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It took about eighth bushels of ashes and twenty-four pounds of grease to make a barrel of soap.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The grease and lye were boiled together in a great pot over a fire out-of-doors.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The soft soap made by this process was like a clean jelly.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In the boiling it was always carefully stirred one way.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>For hard soap the mixture was boiled longer.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A good worker could make a barrel of soap in a day.</p>
<p>The sugar-maple forms extensive natural forests on fertile soil in eastern Canada and the northern States.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In all this section the Indian was making maple sugar when the white man came and thus made on e more great contribution to our pioneer life.</p>
<p>The sugar making in the early spring was a season of special delight to the children, especially if, as in our case, the “sugar-bush”was close to the house.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A plentiful growth of sugar maples in the near-by woods furnished a convenient field for operations.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This was a real family task.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The lack of sugar in the household, due to expense, and the joy of having such a tasty sweet, made maple sugar not only a necessity but a real luxury.</p>
<p>The whole family found occupation–Father and sometimes an older brother took a sharp axe into the maple grove and with a swift hard blow drove the blade with an upper cut into the soft clean bark and wood of the maple about four feet high in the trunk.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Then a hard, slender, wedge-shaped piece of wood was driven into the center of the cut to guide the little stream of sap so that it dropped from the end of this stick into a bucket set on the ground below.</p>
<p>The boys had much fun stripping squares of birch bark from neighboring trees which we shaped into oblong bowls or baskets and these we would set at some of the less promising trees to make up for the lack of buckets.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was an exciting pleasure to run from tree to tree watching the sweet, delicate-tasting sap drop into our hand-made buckets.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And how we would run to add our accumulations to the more generous big buckets.</p>
<p>During this time of gathering the sap a great open fir-place was prepared by setting a cross-bar made of a stout young tree set on two erect crotched pots, usually two young trees which had been cut down and trimmed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>On this cross-bar was hung a great iron kettle or sometimes two, and underneath was built a camp-fire.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The gathered sap was poured into the kettle to boil.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This “boiling-down” process was one of constant watchfulness and stirring; when it was “sugared down” to the proper crystalized state the kettle was removed and the contents poured into small dishes, pans or moulds to cool.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>All this was labor with much discomfort.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was a season when snow was still on the frozen ground and the days were cold, for although he sun might be shining it did not penetrate with much warmth into the woods.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Then too unless wood had been prepared in the preceding fall it was no easy task to gather the necessary fuel for the camp-fire.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Then if you imagine the one whose duty it was to watch the kettle you see a person standing on the cold ground facing a hot fire and its occasional smoke and this for hours at a time.</p>
<p>So while it was fun for the children to play with the beautiful sap and then occasionally get a spoonful of the boiling liquid from the kettle to drop in the snow to make our own candy–for the adults it was real work.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And if there was a real good “run”of sap they might often stay at the task all night, for this sugar-making season lasted only a few days, depending entirely upon the flow of the sap, which could quickly be affected by a change in the weather.</p>
<p>If some neighbor did not have sap-maples convenient they would come in and help, to get their supply of sugar, and then it became another of those many co-operating enterprises which developed sociability and the good-neighbor spirit.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If the neighbors came then other boys and girls would come and this added to the activity and excitement and perhaps we could have a camp-fire of our own from the waste brush that would not be used at the other fire.</p>
<p>Simple hardware could be obtained at the stores but nearly every efficient farmer had to be, if possible, both carpenter and blacksmith, for many farm implements were still made by hand.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A handy man could often trade his labor for the more arduous work on his farm.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The addition of a colter to the old wooden plow was recent.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A good carpenter could make the wood frame of the plow and a local blacksmith could beat out a sheet of steel to add the share.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Any farmer could construct a cross-barred frame of small hewn timbers and insert on one surface heavy iron teeth to form a harrow.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The blacksmith made hors-shoes and shod the horses, although some farmers preferred to do their own shoeing.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>These people made sleds, wagon-bodies and even the wheels, also ox-yokes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They made all or part of their harness.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If a new settler or poor farmer did not have the necessary equipment he could borrow what he needed, usually paying for it by day labor on the lender’s farm.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>So they were independent and co-operative.</p>
<p>They learned to make snow-shoes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The frame was made of ash, a close-grained wood which bends readily when steamed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When bored it is bent into shape and netted with narrow flat leather strips.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A foot foundation was formed in the center and the straps for binding over the instep and ankle.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The farmer sold some of his cattle hides to the tan-yards, others he would have tanned and kept the leather for a number of uses.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Many doors on barns and out-buildings, and also gates had leather hinges.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>From it some made their own moccasins, some being ankle-length and others knee length.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The latter were commonly used with snow-shoes.</p>
<p>Carpenter tools were of a limited variety, and could be found on nearly any good farm.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Always one or more common axes, the broad-bladed axe for squaring timber, the adze, or flat-bladed axe, the blade being set at right angle to the handle and used for hewing flat surfaces, small hand axes, cross-cut saws with heavy blade and teeth with an upright handle at each end, to be operated by two men–hand saws and buck saws, augers for large holes, bits for small holes very rare, planes, squares, levels and hand gimlets for very small holes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In the absence of a necessary boring tool I have seen a man burn a hole with a red-hot iron–in heavy lumber a tedious task.</p>
<p>The prosperous farmer had besides his usual wagons and bobsleds, both single and double, a small open-top buggy for summer driving and in the winter a small box-sleigh and with this last there was always the belt of bells.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The buggy and sleigh were usually owned in consideration for the women folk and the wives and older daughters were usually competent to secure the needed horse out of the pasture and harness and drive anywhere they wished.</p>
<p>In heading this chapter “Home Occupations and Social Life” the terms seemed rather contradictory and in our modern experiences should not be associated but we are here describing a world in which the days seemed filled with a continuous round of duties, and if there was any relaxation or sociability it was usually to be found somewhere in the performance of the day’s work.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The individual found his pleasure in his associated activity with the group.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We had no occasion to be concerned about any program for leisure time.</p>
<p><span>CLOTHES</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>When one knows that a modern woman’s clothes weigh a total of some ounces it is more than interesting to list the numerous and heavy garments our women wore.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The flannel underwear was in two pieces, the upper garment in the form of a shirt usually with full length sleeves, the lower half, or underdrawers, extending to the ankles.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A high-bust corset fitting over the hips and laced in the back as tight as possible to make a wasp-like waist.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>One-pieces combination cotton drawers, covering waist and shoulders and the pants extending below the knees, and usually edged with lace.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Knitted wool home-made stockings or cotton ones purchased at the stores, knee length and held in place by a tape or elastic.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A white cotton or linen chemise covered the entire waist and bust like a shirt with short sleeves and lace-trimmed, especially for dress occasions.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Then cam e the hoop skirt or crinoline, made of light wire rings and tape, a dress foundation made stylish by the French court several centuries before, modified now from the extreme pannier style with extended hips to the graduated medium flare form the waist to the ankles.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The article was now on its way out and would soon be discarded.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Over all these were three or four petticoats, some woollen, some cotton, and some line, depending on the prosperity or social standing of the individual or whether at the moment she was doing her day’s work or expecting company.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Also these were the days of padded busts, and bustles.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>So the bustle is fastened on–a cloth covered, lightly padded wire frame held in position by tapes brought around the waist and tied in front.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>These bustles were of many sizes, some being small and modest, while others were quite large, extending eight to ten inches back from the waist line and were the butt of many hilarious jokes on the part of men and boys.</p>
<p>And then over all these was the dress.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The style in that day was a close-fitting waist carried high about the neck, the skirt dropping low to the instep and almost touching the floor–modesty forbade showing the ankles and any exposure of the bust was taboo except with the ultra-fashionables.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>For out-of-doors were heavy cloth coats both hip and full-length.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Hats were brimmed felts of somber colors trimmed with flowers or feathers.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The old ladies had their black, plaid or paisley shawls and close-fitting bonnets.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Earrings were fashionable, and we heard much talk of girls having the lobes of their ears pierced.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Shoes were high, the tops coming almost to the calf of the leg, and laced.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Milady also had low shoes and slippers.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Hooks and eyes were being substituted for buttons on undergarments but buttons were much in use for adornment on dresses and coats.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Beads were much in vogue and waists were weighted down with elaborate designs.</p>
<p>Dressmaking in the home was an event, a woman coming into the home and often remaining for weeks.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A good dressmaker had a series of appointments which kept her engaged for almost the entire year.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And when one considers all the under garments worn by women and girls, the washing, starching and ironing looms as an appalling task.</p>
<p>At night women and children wore nightgowns of cotton or cotton-flannel while men and boys very commonly slept in their two piece underwear.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The women before retiring took down their hair which during the day was worn in a coil at the back of the head or wound in a knot on top.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When taken down it was combed out and woven into a single or double queue.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They then put on a cotton night-cap which was tied with strings under the chin.</p>
<p>Our modern life may have its conveniences, and they are many, but the life of the early 19th century had its compensations.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In this age of machines a boy or girl steps into an attractively equipped store and a clerk sells a perfect-fitting shoe without thought of all the minute processes which brought it to its perfection.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The pioneer boy passed through his barefoot experiences which usually lasted from late spring to early fall often until he was fifteen or sixteen years old.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But when the time came for a pair of shoes or boots he could watch the whole process form the plain leathers until at last he put the finished product on his feet, proud in an ecstacy unknown to the modern boy and knowing that every stitch and every peg and nail in it was set by his father or grandfather at a little bench in the corner of the kitchen.</p>
<p>Occasionally a neighbor would have some ability as a shoemaker.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It must always be remembered that the settlers came with old country training in many trades.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It might be that such a man would confine his effort to the care of his own family.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Many men could take care of the usual emergency repairs.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But there was a unique and somewhat regular visitor to every small community and isolated farm house, the itinerant shoemaker.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He was heartily welcomed for a stay of days or weeks as necessity required to supply the family with new shoes, and also because he would bring a fund of local gossip and stories or news of the outside world.</p>
<p>He came with his stock of leather for soles and uppers, or the farmer furnished it, and established himself with a little bench in a convenient corner usually in the big kitchen, for his visits were most often in the winter.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>His bench consisted of tow sections, one the low seat so that as he sat his knees would be elevated, and the other a raised platform a t his side on which he could conveniently place his materials.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>His tools and supplies were simple things.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A ball of homespun linen thread, a piece of brown beeswax , a bunch of hog bristles, a bag of wooden pegs, nippers, pincers, a broad-faced short-handled hammer, and awls–a polishing bone, whetstone, and a lap-stone, a stirrup strap, apron and wooden lasts.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This lap-stone was flat and smooth on which he hammered the stiffness out of the leather to make it pliable for bending and sewing.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The stirrup-strap was a continuous leather or heavy cotton band which held the shoe in place, sole up, the shoe-maker keeping it rigid by slipping gone of his feet into the slack of the strap as one would put a foot in a stirrup.</p>
<p>Usually these shoemakers were small statured men past middle life with keen eyes and quiet manners, and it was intensely interesting for a child to watch im work.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He sat on his low bench with coat off and sleeves rolled above his elbows and his heavy bib apron bound around his hips and reaching below his knees.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>With his sharp knife he cut and skivered his leather.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Between his knees stood a small iron post on the top of which he could fit a wooden last around which he could form the shoe.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A small variety of these lasts made the necessary forms for the usual family–at least if there was a good fit it was due to the painstaking care of the shoemaker.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Of special interest was his sewing.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He would select a hog-bristle from his little bundle and twist about half of it into the strands of the end of a working length of his linen thread, leaving one end of the bristle exposed to act as a needle to lead the thread into the holes made by the awl.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When the bristle was attached he picked up his wax and carefully coated the entire length of the thread finally laying it across his knee and rolling it across his knee and rolling it with the ball of his thumb.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The awl was a sharp pointed steel held in a short stout wooden handle.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The driving of this awl with a blow of the hammer, the insertion of the wooden peg in the hole and then a quick stroke to drive it home was all fascinating.</p>
<p>It was with a deep personal interest bordering at times on impatience that we watched this whole process form raw material to the finished shoes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Here was an artist who loved his work, building something before our eyes and assured at every stitch of his waxed thread or blow of the hammer that his labor would meet with deep appreciation.</p>
<p>Except in extreme weather most small girls and boys went barefooted and a graphic writer has well described a boy’s seasons as those of “chilblains and stun-bruises.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Perhaps there was some compensation as one can climb trees more easily barefooted than with shoes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Mud puddles and pools and brooks were enjoyed without any embarrassing explanations to be made at home.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The one annoying necessity was a nightly washing of feet unless one could sneak to bed without it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Then too we did not have to be constantly reminded to tie our shoe-laces, and we could dress more quickly in the morning.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And socks and stockings represented many hours of labor by the mothers or grandmothers of the household.</p>
<p>The usual footwear for boys and men was ankle-high laced shoe or a boot, the top rising close to the knee.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This latter was for working when the last leg was folded inside the boot top; but when used as regular foot covering the pant leg was brought down over the high top furnishing a dressed-up effect.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A boy’s special pride was “boughten” boots with an ornamental red top and bright copper toes.</p>
<p><span>WILD-LIFE</span></p>
<p>Through centuries of hunting and handicapped with short range weapons the Indians had learned the calls of the desirable game and through their imitation had developed the power to lure them to their destruction. The matin-calls of animals and birds like the call of the bull moose and the caribau–the drumming of the partridge–and other lures in infinite variety became his invaluable possession.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They had also devised a variety of traps and snares.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>All of this technique they taught the white man and thus equipped him in a short period to deal with the wild life of his strange new world.</p>
<p>The white hunter’s equipment included a muzzle-loading musket and the necessary accompaniments--several flints or a box of percussion caps, a bag of shot, slugs and bullets, and a powder horn.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As the percussion cap was a recent invention there were still many flint-locks in use.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Father’s gun was a percussion-cap muzzle-loader of which an older brother says: “It was dangerous at both ends.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This remark is very intelligible to anyone who has ever shot one of these old guns---they had an awful kick at times if loaded with a heavy charge, and a few shots produced a sore shoulder.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The powder-horn was a home-made article.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was a cow’s horn cut flush at the base and the end plugged with a block of wood.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It would be difficult to imagine any article being more adaptable to its use than this horn.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Its conical shape curved to fit the body--its hollow center--here was something almost made to order and available in any barn-yard.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The tip end was cut off sufficiently to leave a small opening.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Just below this opening a groove was cut into the horn to hold a stout string, the other end of which was attached to the butt end of the horn and was carried over the head so that the horn was slung under the arm.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A wooden stopper plugged the small end of the horn.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Altogether it made a light, strong container impervious to moisture.</p>
<p>Shot could be purchased in the stores but lead bullets or balls were homemade and slugs were cut from sheet lead.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The shot bag was made of leather with a leather lacing through and around the top to close it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In the making of balls for the muskets a graduated mold was necessary as the bores varied with different makes of guns.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This mold was made of iron and split in half horizontally and hinged.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Half-spheres were cut in each half inside.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The outer surface of the top section was drilled with a round hole above each sphere.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The desired ball was made by melting sheet lead to a fluid and pouring it into the proper sphere.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When cooled the mold was opened and the ball smoothed of any roughness with a knife.</p>
<p>One of the great events for the men in mid-winter was the moose and caribou hunt.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>With the ground everywhere covered with a great depth of snow the surface of which, through days of warm sun and bitter cold nights, was frozen hard as ice, one could start across the country and through the woods in any directions.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The snow was so deep all fences were hidden and stumps and shrubbery buried out of sight.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Here was an open highway built up of accumulated snow--each new storm laying its downy burden upon the ice-cap of the one before and then the sun and frost changed this new surface into a crust of iron thus preparing an unyielding platform for the next snowfall.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Upon such a highway men were free in an otherwise snow-bound wilderness.</p>
<p>Usually the company was made up of half a dozen neighbors.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The equipment was a horse and bobsled which carried the food and bedding for they would be gone for days.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Each man had his snowshoes and musket.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>At camping places they would build their shelters of saplings and boughs with beds made of spruce and fir branches.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This was not altogether a sport.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was a necessary effort to supply additional meat.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And when they returned, as they always did, with a sled load of dead animals, the meat was duly quartered and divided between the hunters who had participated and others of the neighbors.</p>
<p>Our common smaller wild fold were porcupine, skunk, weasel, mink, fox, otter and cottontail rabbits.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Some of these were much sought after for their valuable furs, and so there was much trapping by both Indians and whites.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Our larger game animals were bear, caribou and moose.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Fallow deer had come into some sections of the Province, but not ours, from Upper Canada, the story being that they were driven in some years before by the wolves.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This species of deer and wolf had not been previously seen in the Maritime Provinces.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Deer have since become plentiful but moose and caribou are now very scarce and the few that remain are carefully protected by the government.</p>
<p>Black bears were most dreaded.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They were quite numerous and because of the great damage to live-stock the government paid a bounty of $3.00 or $4.00 for each one killed and the proof to be offered was the bear’s nose, or the nose and a paw.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They would suddenly appear some night and make a killing often of several animals in different fields and apparently for the satisfaction of killing, an animal being torn and mutilated without any part being eaten; and then as suddenly disappear and never be tracked and however carefully the country was watched for days, they would not return.</p>
<p>Log traps were built.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>One used by a neighbor in his woods was a three-sided log enclosure about four or five feet high with a “dead-fall” or heavy log set high up horizontally on a trip support.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>At the bottom of this support a piece of meat was tied to a movable lever for bait.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When the bear grabbed this, the heavy log was released and he was pinned helplessly under it or his neck or back was broken.</p>
<p>At one time the builder found in this trap a live she-bear and whining beside her two small cubs.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He shot the bear and carried the cubs home where he arrived with most of his clothing torn to shreds by their vicious struggles.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He kept them until almost fully grown when he was obliged to kill both of them.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The Province paid him a bounty of $4.00 a piece.</p>
<p>Also, there was a day when several of us small boys left the Steven’s home and walking down the road we sensed the odor of dead animals.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Looking into Tim Savage’s field there lay two mutilated sheep which had been killed the night before.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In the soft earth at the side of the road were deep footprints showing where the bear had climbed back over the fence and then had gone down the road.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In nervous excitement we trailed along passing at times from one side of the road to the other.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>For more than a mile we went and then the tracks left the road and crossing the field at John Knowles’ entered the woods.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Going in about one hundred feet we found a young cow torn and dead, another victim of the marauder who seemed to kill for the joy of killing.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The size of the foot-prints showed that he was full grown.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>At this point our curiosity ended.</p>
<p>I was suddenly wakened one night by the sharp nervous barking of our small dog.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It continued until I heard father go out of the house.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was a clear, starry, moonlit night.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There was a sound as a single blow struck and the dog quieted down.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I learned in the morning that father expected some small animal was prowling about and as he walked in the direction indicated by the dog he passed the wood-pile and picked up a stick of fire-wood.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When he located the animal he let drive and with such true aim that he instantly killed the intruder--a beautiful white-striped full-grown skunk.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The odor reminded us of the incident for some days.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>These animals are specially fond of hens and chickens.</p>
<p>On another day he killed a large porcupine which had wandered out of the woods into the clearing.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>His body lay for some days on a large pine stump and we were tremendously interested in the needles that are his weapons of protection.</p>
<p>Our common belief regarding the porcupine was that he could at will when attacked, throw to some distance, by a muscular movement of his skin, a battery of quills.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But this idea has long been abandoned as it was found that the animal, by nature very sluggish, usually halts at the sign of danger, pulls its sensitive nose between its legs and erects its coating of quills which offer a sharp phalanx of defense--woe betide any animal not wise enough to know that the dormant porcupine is not a ball of fur.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>These quills, about one and a quarter inches long, are sharp as needles and pierce flesh easily, and the other end embedded in the porcupine’s skin releases readily, so it is easy to imagine the condition of the paws and muzzle of a dog or any animal that should pounce upon such prey.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is an agonizing experience, as without human help it takes weeks of effort to extract the quills from the paws and for the muzzle it is worse and sometimes hopeless as the victim has no means of pulling them out and they constantly work themselves deeper.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Death often results in extreme cases.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>These quills are a beautiful scintillating blue-black and were much sought by the Indians who worked them into artistic designs on their moccasins, belts and clothing.</p>
<p>This animal’s greatest fault is the destruction of trees, especially evergreens, as he often satisfies his appetite with the tender bark of the young trees and the wood being exposed they gradually die from the wound.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This girdling is the same as that practiced by the woodsman when he wishes to kill a tree and then allows it to stand until thoroughly dry before cutting down. While not a general practice people did occasionally eat the meat and found it had a taste much like pork.</p>
<p> A noisy chatterer in our rather quiet woods was the small red squirrel and his warning put every bird and animal on guard and passed the word that a human or some other enemy was present.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Occasionally a wild-cat made us a visit.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>One day an older brother went into the woods across the road to cut a sapling and saw a cat creeping up on a hen and her chickens.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Having an axe in his hand he threw it at the animal.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They were both so scared they ran in opposite directions as fast as they could.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The animal was much larger than a house cat and a dirty gray color.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We heard about the Canada lynx or loup-cervier and knew it was in our section but it was rarely seen.</p>
<p>Snakes were rather common but I do not remember that they were poisonous.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We had the usual belief that when killed the tail did not die until sundown.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We often killed them on the road or in the field but never stayed long enough to learn if the saying was true.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But it is interesting to remember that the tip of the tail did move long after the body was apparently dead.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I remember it was an attractive but uncanny sight to see one swimming in a small pond or brook--their little heads with beady eyes the only part showing above the surface.</p>
<p>We also believed that they charmed small birds to helplessness and eventual death.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I remember coming upon what seemed such a scene on e day on the walk in the Knowles’ garden, but startled both snake and bird so that the one flew away and the other scuttled into the deep shrubbery.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>So I really do not know if I saved the bird from a tragic death and cheated the snake of his prey.</p>
<p>The snaring of rabbits was one of our most interesting experiences in the winter.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The making of these snares was a rather simple matter.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Rabbits were plentiful.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Entering the woods a trail would be located and at a point where the rabbits would pass through close shrubbery or low branches a neighboring springy sapling would be pulled down above the tracks and to the top would be attached a wire with a stout string noose; the tip of the sapling was then hooked into a notch on a small tree, or if no tree was available a notched stick was driven into the ground.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The noose, set at the proper height, was spread open so that a rabbit running on the trail would be caught in its circle and as the slightest struggle would pull the sapling from the notch, it was free to spring back to its normal position. So if we had a rabbit it would be up in the air.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>These snares were set in a series and in the morning we could quickly make the rounds.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Sometimes of course the trap was sprung by accident or if caught the rabbit might escape, but even with all the slips we got many and nearly always all we needed, and they made a choice meal.</p>
<p>My oldest brother, John, went out one morning to visit the rabbit snares and came back with a beautiful snow-white cottontail, carrying him along by the hind legs.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Once in a while the rabbit would jerk and twist showing he was still alive when released from the snare.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As John passed the wood-pile he picked up a stick and struck the rabbit a blow on the back of the head with the intent of killing it instantly.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Then he laid the limp body on a block at the corner of the house.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Turning he entered the house but had hardly passed the door, when, attracted by a cry of alarm, we rushed to watch a four-footed piece of white fur leaping across the unmarked snow of the clearing in a mad race to reach the shelter of its native woods.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If there is such a thing as rabbit language he probably told a most exciting tale regarding his adventures when he returned to his burrow.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Wild birds added much to our woodland and combined an attractive variety.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Wild geese, ducks, gulls, loon, king-fishers, sand pipers, partridge, wild pigeon, plover, wood-pecker, blue-jays, crows, robins, swallows, snow-birds, and humming-birds.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Then there were their common enemies, the bird-hawk and hen-hawk.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was a common sight to see a dead hawk with outspread wings nailed to a barn door as it was common belief that nay hawk seeing it would not attempt to invade the premises.</p>
<p>It is impossible to picture to anyone, except possibly a country boy, all the phases of adventure involved in the mere mention of these birds.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We were intrigued by their mating and nesting habits, their calls and their songs, the sizes and colors of their eggs.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>To become in any degree familiar with these there must be many woodland visits at all times of day at various seasons, the quiet, patient watching of low, matted shrubbery, old stumps, fallen trees, or tall dead trees riddled with woodpecker holes. Surprises waited in any fence corner and the least suspected tree might veil the nest or bird you sought.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And always from such journeys and vigils the lover of woods and birds came back with some experience that could not be adequately described–just a feeling–a thrill–always to be remembered.</p>
<p>In all this wild life one memory remains supreme.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>To stand beside the wood-pile or in the clearing when the sun was melting away the long winter snow and hear a call far up in the blue, and looking thrill to the sight of the rhythmic flight of the wild geese; or it may have been in the still night time as I lay wakeful in the attic room close under the roof, that I heard their coming and listened intently to the last dying note as they moved into the mysterious north land.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This was not an incident.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was an event.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was a real harbinger of spring.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That V-shaped phalanx of strong wings led unerringly to its goal by a kingly and untiring leader could not be mistaken.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Spring was following in their path.</p>
<p>The faint, firm “Honk!” of the flock of imperious wild-fowl lifted every man’s eyes form the chilled fields and dreary, cold tasks of winter and turned them wistfully forward to prospective planting of seed in fallow ground and through sunny days to white and gold harvest fields.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In every household voices almost sang “Spring Has Come,” and a new spirit was abroad in the community.</p>
<p>It is long ago since I first heard that haunting cry of the sky wanderers but the wonder still remains.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I hear it yet and a strange nostalgia grips my soul.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Still my heart wakes when the wild geese cry.</p>
<p><span>NATURE</span> <span>AND</span> <span>HER</span> <span>MOODS</span></p>
<p>“I love thy rocks and rills,</p>
<p>Thy woods and templed hills.”</p>
<p><span>Around</span> <span>the</span> <span>Year</span></p>
<p>To present to the mind the things which enter into the landscape to create the scenes of beauty meeting the eye at all seasons, it is only necessary to remind one of the beautiful lakes, the rivers, and the extensive shore line with its numerous bays and inlets, bordered with rich variety of trees and shrubs which are the choice possession of New Brunswick.</p>
<p>It is not easy to interpret the nature and quality of this beauty but to me it has three avenues of appeal: the woods as seen in the changing seasons; the fields and their crops; and the sight and sound of running water.</p>
<p>In the woods surrounding us could be found hemlock, larch, scrub-pine, white pine, cedar, spruce, fir, white, yellow, and black bird, poplar, beech, ash, rock-maple and sugar maple interspersed with scattered hazel, alders, and willow.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Any person familiar with these trees, and acquainted with their individual characteristics through the circle of the year can conjure up a variety of pictures to give delight to the eye and mind.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>In the procession of the seasons each was distinct.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Here we actually had Spring, Summer, Autumn and Winter and thrilled to the peculiarities and privileges of each in turn.</p>
<p>Spring came with life breaking at the return of warmth--snow melting to lie in puddles on the still frozen ground--blue and white ice shedding drops of diamond brilliance in to the unleashed brooks--the apparently lifeless black, brown and gray branches and twigs bearing a new burden of green buds which grew at last to marvelously veined and fringe-edged leaves until the whole landscape was adorned with color and lights and shadows that defeat any artist’s skill.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Pussy-willows break in soft grey, the earliest answer to Spring’s bugle call.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>However phlegmatic no soul can stand unaffected before such a moving scene.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>To experience those Northern spring times is a rich inheritance for any boy or girl.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>To stand in fields or woods and feel life breaking at one’s feet and almost see the buds swelling as they cast their aromatic odors on the air was to be possessed with a spirt which made poets and musicians out of common men and women.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It enhances reverence and instills into personality a deep regard for the finer things of life.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Summer follows with soothing heat which steals into the woods and across the fields germinating the seeds in the fruitful soil , and giving warm welcome to blade and stalk.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A green verdure clothes the dull earth and life moves at marching steps to the gold of harvest.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This is the year’s high season with growth and blossom--drifting white clouds and storm wrack when the thunder crashed.</p>
<p>Then Autumn comes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The sun declines and the days shorten.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A new tang is in the air.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The nights are clear and cool.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Some morning there is a white powder of frost in the lowlands and new colors come on the trees and bushes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Then comes the glory of the autumnal scene.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>At first just a tinge as the frost gently touches a spot on a tree at the forest edge--and a young maple holds a torch against a green background.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In a few days the whole scene is changed, and all is enveloped in a blaze of beauty.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The larch rises like a cone of gold; the maple is clothed with a crimson robe, fading in the distance into changeable shades of brown; the beech presents its bright yellow leaves, but near the trunk it is still green where the frost has not penetrated; the stately ash with its gray trunk, and the birch its leaves still green and its white body decorated with black.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The dark pines and firs and mossy spruce defy the effects of alternate heat and cold and as they tower above the work of destruction break with the pointed tops the smooth uniform round outlines of the hard-wood trees.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is a rich and gaudy but transitory scene.</p>
<p>If the spring is short in this country, Nature has compensated us for the deficiency by giving us a second edition of it at this season, called the Indian summer.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Sunny skies, bland southwest winds, and delicious weather, which has the warmth of spring without its showers, the summer sky without its heat, and Autumn nights without their frosts.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is Nature’s holiday--the repose of the seasons, the lingering beauty of maturity, ere the snows of age efface it forever.</p>
<p>With the fall rains the gold and red fade off into a dull brown--the leaves begin to fall, at first hesitatingly, and then, caught by the wind they drop in myriads and carpet the forest aisles with their shiny, crisp beauty.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As the days pass, lowering clouds gather along the horizon--the raw winds spread them across the heavens, a hush falls on wood and field as they wait the first fall of snow.</p>
<p>Preparedness for the long cold winters created many activities.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The cutting of cords of wood for cooking and heat--the making of snowshoes to cross the white wastes where all paths were hidden and at times no road appeared; the spinning of yarn and the knitting of heavy socks and mittens as some relief against the bitter cold.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>These and more.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Such conditions and labors made households into homes and bound the varying units into compact families who took a simple pride in their co-operating tasks and faced the world with a spirit of unity.</p>
<p>Then on a day the clouds advance out of the far horizon.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The wind is raw and cold.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Out of the moving clouds rain begins to fall and then out of that gloomy murkiness floats in rain-drops the feathery white snow.</p>
<p>“Announced by all the trumpets of the sky,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Arrives the snow, and driving o’er the fields,</p>
<p>Seems nowhere to alight; the whited air</p>
<p>Hides hills and woods - - - -<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>And veils the farm-house at the garden’s end.”</p>
<p>Emerson</p>
<p>The coming of these winter storms which we experienced has never been more graphically described than in the lines of Whittier’s “Snow-bound.”</p>
<p>“The sun that brief December day</p>
<p>Rose cheerless over hills of gray,</p>
<p>And, darkly-circled, gave at noon</p>
<p>A sadder light than waning moon.</p>
<p>– – – – – – –<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>A chill no coat, however stout,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Of homespun stuff could quite shut out;</p>
<p>A hard, dull bitterness of cold</p>
<p>That, checked, mid-vein, the circling race</p>
<p>Of life-blood in the sharpened face,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The coming of the snow-storm told.</p>
<p>– – – – – – –<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Unwarmed by any sunset light</p>
<p>The gray day darkened into night,</p>
<p>A night made hoary with the swarm</p>
<p>And whirl-dance of the blinding storm,</p>
<p>As zigzag, wavering to and fro,</p>
<p>Crossed and re-crossed the winged snow:</p>
<p>And ere the early bedtime came</p>
<p>The white drift piled the window-frame.</p>
<p>– – – – – – –<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>So all night long the storm roared on:</p>
<p>The morning broke without a sun;</p>
<p>– – – – – – –<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>All day the hoary meteor fell;</p>
<p>And, when the second morning shone</p>
<p>We looked upon a world unknown,</p>
<p>On nothing we could call our own.</p>
<p>Around the glistening wonder bent<span class="Apple-converted-space"> 	</span></p>
<p>The blue walls of the firmament,</p>
<p>No cloud above, no earth below,--</p>
<p>A universe of sky and snow.</p>
<p>The old familiar sights of ours</p>
<p>Took marvelous shapes; strange domes and towers,</p>
<p>Rose up where sty or corn-crib stood,</p>
<p>Or garden wall, or belt of wood;</p>
<p>A smooth white mound the brush pile showed,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>A fenceless drift that once was road.”</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>An early morning winter scene after a fresh fall of snow is an unforgettable picture.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The ghostly whiteness. The sun tinting it with pink and gold.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Elongated shadows of skeleton trees, their awkward branches showing black against the white–or shapely silhouettes of evergreens with delicate edging; and at the wood’s margin one sign of life in all the dead silence–the tracks of birds and mink and weasel–and rabbit trails–all showing where these little creatures had ventured forth for food.</p>
<p>And there is another scene equally impressive, a night with a full moon when the still lanes of white are broken with the black shadows of the tree trunks and in between the tracery of leafless limbs and twigs, or the full shapes of the young evergreens thrown across the snow like sections of a fallen storm cloud–and if you listen you may hear the sound of snow as it falls from an over-loaded branch or perhaps a sharp crack as the penetrating frost splits a tree trunk out of which the sap had not retreated.</p>
<p>On such days, with faces pressed against eh window we hailed the coming of flocks of buntings–our common snow birds. Above the undulating banks of new-fallen snow they came and we were held entranced with the riotous darting flight their dainty grey and white bodies poised on vibrant wings, looking almost ethereal in the frost-laden air, filled at times with the fine powder of the wind-driven snow–Strange that such a flash of wing and sweet note should come at this unseemly season–days of still-white desolation, and buried seeds and ice-encased buds.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Winter is fully here.</p>
<p>Nature has gone her rounds like one moving to music, now fast, now slow–in sunlight and shadow–at times dreamy and sentimental, and then to martial strains–blushing like youth at a first kiss–at last white and still as one whom death has touched.</p>
<p>A soul sensitive at all to such changing moods cannot experience a series of such years without feeling that life has a meaning and end beyond the sunset and the dark.</p>
<p>The streams are sealed</p>
<p>From sight and sound.</p>
<p>Yet from the silence they will break again<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>In view of cloud and sky,</p>
<p>Glad to feel the glancing sunlight<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Dance upon the rippling current;</p>
<p>To hold the moon’s soft, nightly-changing form</p>
<p>In quiet pools–to feel the raindrops</p>
<p>Fall in gentle, sweet caress,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>And hear the winds sing lullabies</p>
<p>That hush the birds to rest.</p>
<p></p>
<p><span>IN</span> <span>FIELD</span> <span>AND</span> <span>WOOD</span></p>
<p>It is possibly true that at the time much beauty may be all around us but the sense of utility blots it out of our immediate consciousness.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>So we often go back in memory to recall old sensations at a time when we can analyze the effect they should and may have had upon us at the moment of experience.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Such a thought arises as I think of the various fields on the farms.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The golden waves of embodied sunlight as a late summer wind plays across a stand of wheat or oats.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A field of timothy with its restless gray-green seed-tops is like a sun-flecked pond whose surface is agitated in varying lights and shadows.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The delicate white or green star-laden sprays of buckwheat in bloom, and the fronded red globules on the scarlet-runner beans and the white sprays of the common bush-bean or peas--the cool softness of the corn-silk emerging from the tightly-cased ears on the rustling stalks, or the plumed greenness in the rows of turnips and carrots.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In the days of the early introduction of the potato into France, a gentleman who had some plants in his garden conceived the idea of presenting a bouquet of them to one of the ladies of the Court.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>On the occasion she created a mildly pleasant sensation by appearing in public with the unique flowers.</p>
<p>Just beyond this cultivated beauty was surprise and mystery.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A partridge drums suddenly out of the cool shrubbery.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A bird flies startled from a weedy fence corner, stops at a little distance chirping and fluttering to attract attention.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The farther you follow her allurements the farther you will wander from her hidden nest.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Hornets fly near you and you look overhead to a globular nest, a center of humming activity, on a low-hanging branch or under the eaves of the barn. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Swallows fly in quick, graceful sweeping curves, seeming never to res--field mice scamper to their nests at the base of the stalks in the hay-field.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Crickets and myriads of strange bugs lie in the cool pockets underneath nearly every good sized stone.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The music of living things seems everywhere and far-off a woodpecker hammers on a dead tree-or there is the continuous monotone of the water over the stones in a little brook.</p>
<p>The variety of wild flowers was small.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When the clearings were burned over there came up among the various plants the tall, vigorous fire-weed or iron-weed--to some the bee-plant--with a rather beautiful spike-shaped head of blossoms either red or white.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>These seem to be nature’s compensation, and their simple stateliness contrasted with the gray or blackened stumps and became a decoration for an otherwise scarred and unsightly land, for they disappear when the soil is cultivated.</p>
<p>Or if you go in early summer, and you should, to the open barren you will be rewarded with the unforgettable daintiness in the modest blossom of he blue-berry.</p>
<p>There was a singular beauty in the yellow bloom of the wild mustard that sprang up in the fields of buckwheat, and a wild tang in the air when the choke-cherry trees were in blossom; and directly across our road opposite the house was a “dog-wood” tree which through the summer was a thing of beauty, splashed with its clusters of reddish berries, dropping, half-hidden in the shapely green leaves.</p>
<p>And along any road was the Scotch thistle, standing erect with its blue blossom, its filaments bound together in a gracefully moulded cup of green, the stalk fortified with thorn-edged leaves—the whole set in a grassy green sod, a picture of loveliness attractive enough to adorn a rock garden or reflect its image in a pooled grotto.</p>
<p>And if these allure your feet to wander, on the road west after passing Tim Savage’s place there is a small brook.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It emerges from the woods, to the south and flows in scintillating, rippling beauty through a clearing and meadow at the edge of a hill, crosses the road under an unrailed log bridge and enters the woods again where it laughs in quiet ecstacy, leaps in miniature fairy-like waterfalls smiles with the rays of sunlight and moonlight falling through the trees, and in its shadowy pools offers shelter and security to little native trout.</p>
<p>All around was mystery and the possibility of adventure.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Ears were alert to catch every sound, and bare feet guarded against dry twigs, that no rude noise betray intruders into these aisles of silence.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In the distance was the faint drumming of a partridge, and overhead a squirrel scolded.</p>
<p>A bare-foot boy walks along the edge of the field to avoid the stiff, sharp stubble.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He stoops at times to pluck some wood-sorrel--a small plant growing close to the ground with spade-shaped leaves.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It has a pleasing sweet acid taste.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Or again he may have spied the bloom of the re-clover whose minute sacs were so full of a sugary sap--a popular supply for the stray honey-making bees--and also the lumbering bumble-bee which we struck down and killed with our caps to drain their honey bags or pick the lumps of pollen off their legs.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Occasionally he stopped beside a round puff-ball and crushed it to feel the warm brown powder ooze up between his toes.</p>
<p>At the edge or close within the margin of the woods along the road or beyond the clearing, the hazel bushes grew with their choice nuts which we gathered in the early fall.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>These nuts grow singly or in clusters of two or three, and each is enclosed with a touch sac-like envelope.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This has the appearance of a round ball having been laid in a small napkin and the corners pulled up around it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This membranous sheath is completely covered with a thorn-like fuzz and when one has spent a little time removing it several fingers and the thumbs are full of these almost invisible thorns which for several day create very unpleasant prickly sensations</p>
<p>These nuts are a satisfying delight.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The meat comes whole in a solid round ball form its smooth shell and when eaten fresh from the bush they are easily crushed and have a cool delicate flavor.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You might also come upon a rare-oak tree with its acorns either sweet or bitter or best of all a beech-nut tree with tis dainty leaves that always seem to drip sunshine, and in the late fall the small sweet nuts were a prize worth seeking.</p>
<p>As you continue your walk you may find yourself before a barrier of unique design--a stump fence.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The man who with much labor hauled these stumps and piled them in alignment to create a wall at the edge of the clearing unconsciously rendered an aesthetic service.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In the late fall their gaunt and twisted soft-grey roots with stones entangled as they were when torn from the earth, present a grotesque and almost ugly outline against the background of the trees beyond; but at the end of a few months when the early snows have fallen the long line seems like the skeleton of some huge pre-historic monster that ages of sun and rain has whitened.</p>
<p>Spring comes and growing vines find it a glorious place to creep and wind-shrubs and fern fireweed and wild raspberry begin to veil it and dissipate its seeming ugliness.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Golden-rod and mid-summer flowers flaunt their loveliness along it sheltering border.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And what a tenement for gentle creatures.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>From end to end it is a home of mystery and surprise. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>At any season of the year it will repay any nature lover’s visits if he goes with open ears and eyes and quiet feet.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Nervous wasps and hornets, armored and bayoneted, flit in and out, and hollow roots become a hive for wild bees, and always a careful search would discover a bird’s nest with dainty eggs of fledglings unfeathered and ugly, and always hungry.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Here squirrels and field mice hoard their stores and the fence supplies them with parade ground and conceals their thresholds.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The impenetrable tangle of wild raspberry bushes, their long interlacing canes covered with hoary bloom in the spring, made a spot worth visiting--a mecca of desire and satisfaction when the berries were ripe.</p>
<p><span></span>“<span>MUSIC</span> <span>IN</span> <span>RUNNING</span> <span>BROOKS</span>”</p>
<p>Nature’s music is at times delicate and sweet and perhaps never sweeter than in the soft murmur or book-water crossing a low-banked meadow--or washing with a low hissing the twigs and stalks of the arching alders as it emerges from the woods; or as it drops in murmuring little falls in shady forest lanes.</p>
<p>The seasons also bring to the waters varying moods.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Early spring breaks a miniature dark gash in the last fluffy snows of winter and at the water’s edge the white, powdery ice mixes with the clear crystal plates which, as they break, chime like a shattered Venetian wine glass.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The sun falls on it and it is rainbow-tinted.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In the clear cold water there is a sound of hurrying as if to flee beyond the cold and prisoning bonds to reach in haste the lands of sunshine and warmth.</p>
<p>Then come the days when the last snow has melted, green grass and verdure spring upon the bank--swelling buds trail upon its surface, the tingling cold departs from its waters and it is soothing to the touch.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>On its clear, pebbly bed the water-cress blooms in star-like beauty.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You reach into the shallows and pluck the sprays and your tongue tingles with the delicate peppery taste.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Down below the rook in the shadow of a great tree there is a deep pool and if you approach cautiously you are almost sure to see a spotted trout in its depths.</p>
<p>The summer sun forms miniature reflections of trees and shrubs in its undulating mirror.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The “Devil’s Darning-needle,” that will sew your lips together if you offend him, darts back and forth above its surface with his blue-back, gauzy wing outstretched.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Strange how this superstition regarding the “dragon-fly” should be so wide-spread and persistent, and we might apply this same query to many other ideas which we hold that have as little foundation.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Out of the current in quiet pools the little “skaters,” gray wheat-seed-shaped bugs with long legs, glide on the glassy surface making distorted moving shadows on the white sand of the brook bed, and you wonder on the mystery of its ability to walk upon the water.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A minnow, startled by intruding feet, darts to refuge under a shelving rock.</p>
<p>There is a stagnant pool where the water has seeped through the bank in to a hollow and in the greenish scum are masses of frog spawn that feels like soft jelly in your fingers, and already there are swarms of pollywogs which if you come often you will see in process of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>transformation--heads forming--legs emerging--tails vanishing--color changing--and then on a day you will see small frogs airing themselves on half-submerged rocks and logs--that is, if you have come quietly--for noisy feet and voices will cheat you of many things in the worlds of nature.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Above this slimy water the mosquitoes are whining if you are there in the early twilight, while later if the darkness steals on you, you will be intrigued by the flashing light of the fire-fly and the raucous night-call of the bull-frogs.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>All of these things are but a suggestion of the mysteries and delights that wait the questioning mind in the great out-doors.</p>
<p>Some day as you linger there is a chill in the air at sunset time and a golden-red leaf flutters down to the brook’s margin and is borne away.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Soon all along the banks there is a mottled covering of autumn leaves and the branches overhead are bare.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There is a harshness in the air and a spirit of loneliness.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The water is humming a lullaby.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Soon it will be a dirge.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Chill, frosty nights will turn the water into ice--hoary feathers will fall, at first dropping with an almost imperceptible sigh into the current; but the unseen pygmies of winter stretch through lengthening nights their cantilever bridge of ice on which the snow finds a sure foundation and won all the landscape is white.</p>
<p>The song of the brook is ended,</p>
<p>Its music is hushed in a sigh;</p>
<p>But it waits the day of freedom,</p>
<p>To break the days of its bondage</p>
<p>When the wild-goose calls on high.</p>
<p><span>RANDOM</span> <span>INCIDENTS</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>“Come back with me to the first of all,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Let us learn and love it over again.”</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Browning.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I wish I might go back</p>
<p>Along the ways so long remembered.</p>
<p>The trails perhaps are overgrown<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Or widened into dusty roads;</p>
<p>The trees that circled house and farm<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>May too be gone,</p>
<p>Felled by the axe or fire-consumed.</p>
<p>The hills we climbed with quickened breath</p>
<p>May altered be, their romance lost.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The years, no doubt, have done as much to us</p>
<p>As to those haunts of long ago.</p>
<p>And so I sit beneath the quiet stars</p>
<p>At a far-distant spot,</p>
<p>And in the silence, thus apart,</p>
<p>Relive in tremulous speech and pulsing thought</p>
<p>The days that were, and what they held.</p>
<p><span>My</span> <span>First</span> <span>Scar</span></p>
<p>During my first winter father and mother were engaged as cooks at a camp in the woods a short distance south of Bathurst.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>For an assistant they had a French woman to do the rough and heavy work.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The Government was building the Inter-Colonial Railroad from Saint John to Caraquet and this camp, known as Red Pine, was established to lay some miles of road-bed which included a large culvert of granite and cement. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The camp buildings were constructed of logs cut on the ground.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The main building was about 30 x 20 feet with a hip roof.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The floor was built of logs and after the logs were laid, the top rounded surfaces were hewed off to make the floor level but not smooth.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This was what was called a “puncheon floor” in New England.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It could be swept but not washed or scrubbed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>About thirty men were in camp.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Most of them slept upstairs in the open loft.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There were two small tool and material buildings about three hundred feet away with some space in which a few men could sleep.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>From the residence in this camp I carry a memento.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>On the fleshy part of my arm just above the elbow I have a long white scar.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Mother calls it the “Red Pine” mark.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As she tells the story I was in a cradle set close to the stove at the time she was preparing a meal.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>On the stove was a tea-pot piping hot and as she worked about the stove something disturbed the tea-pot and it and its content landed in the cradle on my arm</p>
<p><span>Ghost</span> <span>Story</span></p>
<p>The following story records a mysterious happening during this same winter.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Very often things of this nature may be explained by knowing the character and disposition of the person relating the experience.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But in this case such knowledge makes the difficulty greater.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Mother is a cool, self-possessed woman.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I never saw her excited in the presence of any problem or happening--so when she tells this story I can only wonder--as I can suggest no explanation and she has none.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Here is her story.</p>
<p><span>A</span> <span>Ghost</span> <span>Visits</span> <span>Red</span> <span>Pine</span></p>
<p>Red Pine Section Inter-Colonial Railroad, date December 23, 1872.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The day before Christmas eve.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The men number about 20, more or less, and were paid off to go home and return in a week to take up work again. Three or four remained in the shanty.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>All was quiet after supper; the men that remained went upstairs to bed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Downstairs was my husband, a French woman assistant, and myself.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>On the stairs was one loose step, which I told the men would cause someone to fall if not nailed down, but they did no heed me.</p>
<p>This night I put two geese in a tub of cold water to take the frost out of them as I was to cook them on Christmas day. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This tub was set on a stand, covered with a board, by the stairs.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Inside the bedroom door was an old trunk.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If you lifted the cover and let it fall it made a peculiar sound.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The windows were half-sash built solid into the log walls.</p>
<p>In the evening John Thomas, one of the men, handed me a pocketbook and asked me to keep it until he called for it, as he had no safe place to put it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I put it between the mattress and feather bed.</p>
<p>In the night I was awakened from a sound sleep by a noise form the stairs as if that loose step had fallen down.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I thought one of the men was coming downstairs, but no more noise.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Then I thought the cat threw the board off the tub.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Next I heard footsteps as if a heavy man was striding across to the door.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It sounded as if a heavy man was striding across tot he door.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It sounded as if he had half frozen moccasins on.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He went out and left the door open. (To open the door it would be necessary to lift the latch on the inside or draw it up by the latch-string outside.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If latched, the door could not possibly be blown open by the wind, and if closed it would lock).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I awoke my husband, after an argument, to shut the door.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Next morning I asked the men and they denied it and said they never heard anything.</p>
<p>The next day passed and night again.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Everyone retired as usual.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In the middle of the night I was again awakened by the noises of that trunk lid falling, and next the same footsteps as the night before from the door of my room to the outer door and the door left open as before.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I had to wake my husband to get up and shut the door.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I thought when I heard the trunk lid fall someone was looking for the pocketbook I had in my keeping.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>After passing out, he t ramped around the side of the shanty, past the bedroom window, up into the woods.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It sounded on the crusted snow as if he broke through the crust at every step.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In the morning I told my story and the men went out to follow the tracks, but there were no tracks to be seen in the new snow.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Now there had been a light fall of snow in the evening.</p>
<p>Next night the men put props against the door.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Two of the men went out and tried to burst it in, but could not.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The men said no one could open the door.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This was the third night--Christmas night.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The French woman, probably afraid, left the house that afternoon and went up the railroad to the next section camp.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Everyone was confident that all would be right and so retired fro the night.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But again I feared the latchstring pulled quickly form outside, eight or ten times, and the door flew open.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I had to waken my husband again to shut the door.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The props were lying on the floor.</p>
<p>Everyone was puzzled at what had happened.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>All these visitations occurred between twelve and one o’clock each night.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The loose stair step had not fallen; the cover on the tub was not knocked off; there were no steps in the fresh snow; the little dog (a good watch dog) sleeping under the table did not bark.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He never seemed to hear anything any more than the men upstairs.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It seemed I was the only one to hear it all.</p>
<p>Next night two of the men had a gun which they loaded and said they would sit up and shoot at whatever they heard or saw, but nothing happened.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We remained at Red Pine until the middle of April.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Everything continued peaceful.</p>
<p>Mrs. Elizabeth Henry</p>
<p><span>A Night Visitor</span></p>
<p>The north window of our house overlooked the road.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Immediately across this road the woods began and stretched away for miles, and at the edge opposite the house was a log pig-pen--even the top was closely covered with small logs.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Such a pen was necessary as otherwise the pigs would wander off into the woods, and also they had to be protected from wild animals, especially bears.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>One night while very young I was asleep in mother’‘s bed and was awakened by movement and light.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>On opening my eyes I saw mother standing in night-gown and little cap holding a lighted candle and looking out the window.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In the morning she said she had heard a noise and the pigs squealing and when she looked out the window she saw in the dim light a bear dropping from the top of the pig-pen.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He had been trying to loosen the logs, which of course were held in place by cross-bars, but was frightened away by the light in the window.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>After breakfast we excitedly examined his tracks in the soft dirt where he wandered down the road.</p>
<p><span>A Mote in the Eye</span></p>
<p>While still in pinafores there occurred an incident which recalls the quick-wit and resourcefulness of my mother.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I had been playing on the floor and a fleck of some material had gotten in my eye.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>After rubbing at it a while and no relief, I came to her.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She was sitting nursing the baby and as I voiced my complaint at her knee she had me look up at her and then quickly reaching for the breast at the baby’s mouth she pointed it toward my eye and with a slight pressure of her hand shot with unerring accuracy a stream of milk into the offending eye.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Instantly my trouble was over.</p>
<p><span>First Lesson in Dish-Washing</span><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Childhood disappointments are tragic experiences.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>On a day possibly when I was not more than five my older brothers all planned to go fishing.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Of course I longed to go regardless of the fact that I could not possibly have walked the necessary distance as it was quite a ways and they would be gone all day.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>On their departure I sobbed and wailed and mother tried different methods of quieting me.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As we had just eaten and the dishes were still unwashed she induced me to help her wash the dishes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In later years with only one girl in the family I was to have a lot of such experience and even after I was married.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I have often said that I began washing dishes so early and kept it up so consistently that it seemed at times that I was conscious of a previous existence in which I had done it also.</p>
<p><span>Frosted Windows</span></p>
<p>The stream-laden, heated air of our room, when it came in contact with the glass of the window, condensed and froze into beautiful, translucent, silvery coatings, exhibiting, in the delicate texture of their brilliant tracery, every imaginable form of landscape, figures of men, and animals, trees and variegated patterns, like exquisite embroidery.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The beauty of this partial incrustation of the glass no language can describe.</p>
<p>In every pane of glass the creation was different as nature had no limit to the patterns.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In the varying degrees of heat and cold, in shadows and in sun, a kaleidoscopic change came upon the whole window.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In a day, some times in an hour, all would vanish and then with the cool of twilight would begin again the whole process of artistry that aroused the deepest sense of beauty.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I confess to having spent much time in the childish amusement of studying and admiring the infinite variety of shapes it presented.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>For us it was nature’s ever-changing picture book.</p>
<p><span>Hot Water Again</span></p>
<p>Another accident of my boyhood was rather unique.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I had a habit in the cool winter evenings of lying on the floor on my stomach with me legs stretched under the stove which stood up on legs about ten or twelve inches form the floor.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>On this particular night some neighbors and come in and during the visit I fell asleep in the position I have described.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But I was rudely and suddenly awakened.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>An iron pot full of boiling water was on the stove.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The fire needed attention and some one lifted a lid and started to put in a chunk of wood.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In doing so the pot was disturbed and as it tipped in my direction a good portion of its contents hit me square on the buttocks.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was a painful experience and after being in bed some days I literally had to eat standing up.</p>
<p>Speaking of this habit of falling asleep, I recall the additional experience of often waking hours after or sometimes not till morning and being surprised and happily satisfied to find myself comfortably tucked in bed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And often during mature years, worn with the day’s demands, I have wished that I could again fall asleep to be picked up by someone with the same concern and care and undisturbed be laid to rest.</p>
<p><span>Tongue Trouble</span></p>
<p>One day I learned that it is not pleasant to put one’s tongue on frosted metal.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>On an early winter morning I had been sent to get something from some outer building.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The door into this was fastened with a metal hasp and as it did not readily release under my fingers I thought I would pull it open with my teeth as I had found this a very efficient method in untying knots.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But this was not so good.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As my warm moist lips and tongue came in contact with that frosted iron a burning sensation shot through them and as I jerked away I left some patches of skin from my lips and the tip of my tongue showing white on the black metal.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But I opened the door.</p>
<p><span>Another Scar</span></p>
<p>Another day as I played near the door of the house I had the misfortune of stepping barefooted upon a piece of a broken glass bottle.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Father was at home--mother was not.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>So he brought a pan of water to where I was sitting on the ground and I can see today that fresh clear water turning quickly red with my fast-flowing blood.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>What breathtaking terror grips a child’s mind at the sight of blood especially their own.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>With care it was soon stopped but the scar still remains.</p>
<p><span>Warts</span></p>
<p>I have often been interested in hearing people talk about warts and how to cure them, so you may enjoy a boyhood experience.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I listened one day very intently to an older cousin telling of a sure way to get rid of warts.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was so simple and in a way so mysterious it gripped my imagination.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This is the way you do it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Count carefully every wart on your hands--of course, if you have been playing with toads you are liable to have a good many; then take a cloth bag and go out and pick up small white pebbles, one for each wart.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Put them in the bag and carry it with you and drop it where someone is likely to pick it up.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When it is picked up your warts will disappear.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>These instructions I followed faithfully.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I counted one hundred and sixty-five warts, and, believe it or not, somebody must have picked up that bag of white stones, for in a remarkably short time every wart disappeared.</p>
<p><span>Chips</span></p>
<p>A small chore that fell to the lot of small boys was gathering chips.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The wood for the stove was felled trees dragged from the woods and thrown in a pile near the house.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Then at intervals when it could be worked in between other tasks it was chopped into stove-lengths and piled in neat order where it could be ready at hand during the winter.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In this cutting process the ground would become littered with chips.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>After lying in the wind and sun for weeks they would become very dry and made and excellent starter for the fire in the stove.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The fresh, clean, sappy odors of those chips from various wood still lingers in memory.</p>
<p>A generous wood-pile was a sure mark of frugality and foresight and a farmer could be judged by it as surely as by any other condition.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Wood was a vital daily necessity and it was good and bad.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It could be clean and dry and heat-producing, or green, soggy and smoky; and a man could furnish either one to his women-folk.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is easy to imagine that some men would supply the one which meant the least labor to themselves and some were inconsiderate enough to leave the saplings or logs lie for the women to cut as they could.</p>
<p><span>A Great Journey</span></p>
<p>I had a very memorable tip one day when mother took me out to Clifton on “The Shore” near which was located the grindstone quarry and mill where father was working.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is a rather dim picture but some details have not entirely faded out.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was here that I was born a few years before.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was a straggling farm settlement with three or four stores in the center.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We went with horse and wagon--mother driving.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>On the north road there is a beautiful brook crossed by an unrailed natural timber bridge.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>On the left it breaks out of the brown alders whose roots it bathes and on the right passes a grove of choke-cherry bushes which bore a luscious harvest each summer.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I remember this well for once besides what I carried home I ate enough to make me very sick.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>From here the brook wandered off into the woods, to wend its lonely way to the bay through ever-widening channels.</p>
<p>Passing this spot we continued for miles on a narrow dirt road closely bordered on either side by the forest through which it had been cut.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>At the end I saw Bay Chaleur and off in the distance was a sailing vessel waiting for a cargo of stones.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>These are loaded on scows---flat tub-like rectangular boats, and these are then towed out to the side of the vessels where derricks operated by man-power lift the stones above the deck and lower them in to the hold.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The stones of many sizes are shipped to Boston and New York.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Here the tides are very high and we had no wharves at the shore.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Near the water’s edge was a long, low, frame building--the mill--open at one end where the stones were shaped.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I do not remember seeing the quarry but in this some years before my father had a serious accident.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A blast had been set and the fuse fired and the warning given. Father started to run and tripped, falling hard upon the rough rock on his right knee. The knee-cap was broken and for several years he had to use crutches.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>During this time he suffered excruciating pain.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The doctors talked amputation.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Finally a doctor burned the cords below the knee relieving the pain, but stiffening the leg for life.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Occasionally he walked the six miles home from the mill for the week-end arriving late after dark but I remember seeing him go in the early morning light, his gun over his shoulder and passing quickly out of sight in the trees with that peculiar hitching walk due to his stiff knee.</p>
<p>After writing this story there came to me through the courtesy of Mr. Gordon Read of Stonehaven, N.B. an ably written article describing the processes of quarrying and milling the grindstones.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>These are made in all sizes from 84 inches in diameter by 14 inches thick weighing 3 1/4 tons down to those 8 inches in diameter.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Small scraps of material are made into scythe stones or whetstones.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This quarry has been in operation for almost 100 years and the company is still headed by the same family.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Three great-grandsons of the founder, Joseph Read, are the present executives.</p>
<p>It is a curious fact that this industry, so important to the cutlery and hardware and every farm and machine-shop business, is barely mentioned in any of the best reference works.</p>
<p><span>Forest Fire</span></p>
<p>On a momentous day and night a forest fire broke out and raged in the woods between us and the Shore of Bay Chaleur.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It swept from west to east.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I learned later it was not a great fire but such experiences were easily impressed upon my boyish mind.</p>
<p>We had seen during the day the black smoke reddened at times with the glare of the swift moving ravenous fire below.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Twilight passed and as night came on men and older boys of the community came to our house and stood about in the road or leaned leisurely upon the fence.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The fire was still miles away and there was the usual conjectures as to what might happen if the wind veered.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In my young mind it was exciting, awe-inspiring and calamitous, and if my thoughts needed further stimulation it came in the fact that neighbors brought with them their guns.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Off there in the near recesses of the woods were many wild animals fleeing terrified before that holocaust.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A slight change of wind and the path of the fire would be altered.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>These men seemingly feared that it might turn in our direction.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As the darkness deepened the light from the fire cast over the landscape a semblance of moonlight that threw isolated trees, fences and buildings into a ghostly silhouette.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The low-lying, far-flung smoke clouds glowed like dying embers on a mammoth hearth.</p>
<p>We boys stood around expectantly excited.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>At any moment a caribou might dash across the road--or best of all-our of those shadowy trees might come a black bear--even smaller creatures like porcupines and rabbits would have satisfied our curiosity as they fled for safety.</p>
<p>The hours passed and it was long past a small boy’s bedtime, so an older brother and I were sent with a cousin of about the same age to his house about a mile up the road. Leaving these exciting surroundings was not easy and we carried with us our fears and apprehensions.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The distant fire cast a deep shadow upon the roadside, which was bordered closely by the thick woods and shrubbery.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We were more than half way when suddenly out of this forbidding gloom came a sound--a quick deep breath.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Standing with clasped hands we were rooted to the spot.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Then a part of the shadow moved and rose out of the drainage ditch.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Fear gripped us to helplessness and then we saw it was a familiar form--that of a neighbor’s calf which had wandered from an adjoining field.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>With deep relief and trembling knees, and minds yet full of apprehension we went on our way.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The next day the smoke rested over the far-off blackened stumps and charred trees.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The fire had burned itself out.</p>
<p>To reveal what disaster can be wrought by these forest fires I am repeating a description given by an eye-witness of the “Great Fire” on the Miramichi in 1825 when my grandparents were living in Newcastle, a town which was almost totally destroyed.</p>
<p>“It was excessively hot summer and fires were burning in numerous places upon the Miramichi and St. John rivers and their tributaries and the air was hot and everywhere obscured with smoke.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The wind began to blow from the southwest and the fire to spread.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The wind increased gradually to a hurricane, and the fire advanced with proportionate rapidity.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>At one o’clock in the afternoon, it was still seventy miles up the river; and in the evening it was at Douglastown.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It traveled 85 miles in nine hours, so that scarcely on a fleet horse could a man have escaped from it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Lumberers in the woods were caught, and solitary settlers with their families; and while all their property was destroyed, some saved their lives by rolling themselves in the rivers till the scorching blast had passed over them.--The flame as it advanced was 25 miles wide--coming from the west it rushed past the tows of Newcastle and Douglastown, leaving a green margin of some miles in breadth between its southern edge and the river.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When, in its easterly course, it reached Burnt-church River, the wind lulled, turned round, and drove the fire up the river again.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It then came back along the green fringe it had left as ti descended, and by the way licked up the towns of Douglastown, and Newcastle--of their 254 houses leaving only 14.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>At these towns, men and cattle rushed into the river; and though a hurricane was raging on its surface, people hurried into vessels and boats and scows and eagerly thrust off from land.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The lesser dread was forgotten in the presence of the greater.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But although so huge a flame was raging, there was no light.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Showers of ashes and burned twigs, and still burning brands, and thick smoke filled the air, and for two days afterward, amid a perfect calm, the darkness on the river was such that a bell was kept tolling on each bank to indicate the site of the ferry, that people might know where to steer to.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The town of Chatham, on the opposite side of the river, in a great measure escaped; but the Nassau settlement, six miles behind it, was burned to the ground, the settlers only saving their lives by rolling themselves in the river till the flame passed away.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In many streams, where the native woods still overhung them, the water proved insufficient to preserve human life; and thousands of salmon and other fish found floating on their surfaces showed how intense and penetrating the heat must have been.</p>
<p><span>By Candle-light</span></p>
<p>The poet Whittier records that it was the transient visit of a schoolmaster to his home that stirred him to poetic composition.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This master had a copy of Robert Burn’s poems which he used to read aloud by the fireside during the winter evenings and, perceiving the impression they made on the boy, he left the book with him when he moved on to the next family.</p>
<p>I too have a memory of Burns—a picture which through the years has never faded from my mind.--A deal table set against the east wall of the common kitchen and living-room.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>On it a lighted, home-made tallow candle, and sitting close to it with his book held into the light, my father, a black-bearded man in his early thirties, reading aloud with a pleasing, clear voice--knowing well the broad Scotch--the poems of Robert Burns.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And within the modest halo of that light several boys drank in their first droughts from the fountain heads of literature.</p>
<p>In the half-shadowed background sat a round-faced, brown-eyed woman busy with her knitting and if at times she heard a restless sigh of whimper her foot touched gently the rocker of the wooden cradle that stood beside her chair.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Years may pass but memories of scenes like this are in the blood streams of our lives.</p>
<p>In “A Memory” Whittier paid tribute to Burns in the following lines which I quote as expressing also my own feeling toward a singer I have always loved.</p>
<p>“Yet when the panes are frosty-starred,</p>
<p>And twilight’s fire is gleaming,</p>
<p>I hear the songs of Scotland’s bard</p>
<p>Sound softly through my dreaming.”</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The table mentioned in this incident is still in use at the home of a good neighbor who live in Canobie.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My father made it about sixty-five years ago.</p>
<p>Speaking of my father I am reminded that recently in reading the works of Stephens, the modern Irish poet, I came upon the term “Da” used for father.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This was a common term of address which we children used when speaking of or to our father, but I had not thought of it for years nor was I, until then, aware that it was of Irish origin.</p>
<p><span>SCHOOL</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The government required each community to erect tis own school house and select a master or mistress.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Some effort was made to find efficient teachers by requiring education in a Normal School or an examination by the head of the School.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The necessary qualifications being approved, the teacher was given a certificate.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>These certificates were graded and the government paid the teacher a stated amount per year according to the grade.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In our school, my mother’s contract called for a twelve month school and she was to be paid $200.00 by the government and an equal amount by the school district.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In her experience she often received government “due-bills” for all or part of her salary, which could be traded in the stores at a discount, and the district might pay in farm produce and perhaps some money.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She got a few days now and then for a vacation.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If the teacher employed was single the community paid its part of the contract by “boarding him or her around” for stated periods.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>With homes of varying accommodations and family groups such an arrangement occasioned many ludicrous and trying experiences for the teacher.</p>
<p>The men, in a community chore, at some time each summer accumulated in stove-lengths the necessary winter’s supply of wood.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This was neatly piled in one room of the school-house.</p>
<p>My first introduction to education was in a one-room, one-teacher school-house.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The unusual thing about it was that my mother was the teacher.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When I began I already had three brothers ahead of me.</p>
<p>As I look back through the years the amazing thing is that my mother did her tasks in the home, her duties in the school to the satisfaction of the community, and raised her family.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In later years I have found the secret of her accomplishment in a quiet inner resourcefulness that faced each experience of life open-eyed and unafraid.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Her life was actuated by a natural, reserved dignity that gave her a sympathetic understanding of her children and her neighbors–always a woman with clear convictions based in knowledge and reason.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Her religious life was without parade and inspired with sincerity and unwavering faith.</p>
<p>When about four years old and perhaps not with the desire to go to school but wishing to find my mother I several times followed her at a safe distance, appearing at the door when school had well started.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My appearance was the cause of much giggling and a general disruption of all deportment.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>On each occasion I was sent home with some large girl to see that I safely arrived.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But one day mother took the matter definitely in hand and taking an ever-ready switch I was chased down the road with the switch playing on my legs and urging speed and tears.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That settled it and I did not try to go to school again until my age of five years gave me the legal right.</p>
<p>That first school still remains a very definite memory and I have before me as I write a picture of it as it is today, standing and in use after all these years.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was located in about the center of the little settlement which was a one-road community.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was a one-story frame structure consisting of two rooms.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The small north room was the “entry” and wood room. Through this one came into the class-room which contained about twenty school desks.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>These desks were made of unpainted boards with sloping tops.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The seats were plain benches seating two pupils at a desk.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Immediately inside the door was the stove, a box-shaped sheet-metal affair with a door at one end to put in the wood.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It would hold a stick about thirty inches long.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Opposite the stove was a raised platform on which was the teacher’s table.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Windows on the sides over-looked the play-ground.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>On the west wall was the blackboard , and our chalk was in lumps not sticks.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>At the south end of the room were two doors opening on the play-ground, one for the boys and the other for the girls.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But once outside we were all together.</p>
<p>A few feet south of the building was the well.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A frame covering about four feet high was built over the mouth to protect it form snow and dust.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The water level was about ten feet below the ground and the water was drawn up in a wooden bucket which was lowered on a pole with a hook near the butt end in which to engage the bail or handle of the bucket.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This pole was a long sapling completely trimmed and smoothed except for the up-turned stub of one branch which served as a hook.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The system was to lower the bucket held by this hook and when it reached the water give it a quick jerk sideways so that one side would sink and take in some water. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As it gradually filled it would right itself and was then drawn hand over hand to the curb.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Another way was to lower the bucket and with the butt of the pole inside push the bucket down into the waste.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In either way there was danger if one was not careful that the bail would escape the hook and if it filled the bucket would sink to the bottom.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In the winter time it was very common for the escaping water, as the bucket was being raised, to instantly freeze as it fell against the side wall and it was quite a task to keep an opening large enough to allow the bucket to pass to the water below.</p>
<p>A hand-bell vigorously rung by the teacher or some privileged pupil called the scholars to assembly on all occasions.</p>
<p>The school session began each day with a pause for reverence in the reading of a portion from the Bible.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The selection was generally from Psalms or the Gospels.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This was done without comment.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The pupils at the beginning of the term were divided into groups or classes according to age or ability. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The day’s program covered reading, writing, arithmetic, spelling, geography, history and grammar.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Text-books were in use for most subjects, and were purchased by the pupils.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The minimum age for admission was legally set at five years but there was no maximum limit, so very often teachers would have pupils as old or older than themselves, a thing which very often created serious problems in discipline.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Spelling-bees were often held and were the occasion of much rivalry.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Our slates were bound with wood frames, and we used plain gray slate pencils.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was of course not very sanitary but a boy’s usual method of cleaning the slate was to spit on it and wipe it dry with the sleeve of his jacket.</p>
<p>Writing was practiced on fool’s cap paper with pen and ink.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We had no copy-books so the teacher would write a copy–some phrase–a proverb or saying, at the top of the sheet and we copied it many times.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Goose-quill pens had very recently gone out of use so we were using steel pens.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>With a plentiful supply of goose feathers at hand we used to try to make pens just out of curiosity.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There were no blotting papers, or any devices for drying ink. A few years later I picked up a round wooden box like a salt-shaker containing a black powder which was shaken on the written page.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When think dried the powder was accumulated and poured back into the shaker.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In a recent “Movie” I saw one of these in use on Abraham Lincoln’s desk.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The usual habit after writing was to wave the paper around until the ink dried.</p>
<p>When we had to draw straight lines we obtained a black ebony ruler from the teacher’s desk.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This was about seven-eighths of an inch in diameter and about a foot long.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We had no flat rulers and none with graduated inches and fractions.</p>
<p>Lead pencils and paints were unknown to us.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We found in the mixture of pebbles in the beds of the brooks flat, smooth fragments of keel (ocher), usually red which would mark nicely on almost any surface and this was a good substitute.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A fragment of this was about as common in a boy’s pocket as a lead pencil is today.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is soft and chalky and ground into a fine powder is used in artist’s colors.</p>
<p>We heard of major school disciplines and difficulties but in our experience the punishments were minor.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Standing in the corner.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Hands slapped with that black rule.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Occasionally someone was “birched.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>To make this most embarrassing a boy so punished was sent out to cut his own switch.</p>
<p>One incident stands out from the general picture of school routine.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>For some reason when about eight years old I won a prize in recognition of some work well done.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Just what I did I have forgotten but the prize I still remember–it was a small story book with a reddish-brown cloth binding entitled “The Mistletoe Bough”; also I recall the embarrassed pride with which I accepted it at the teacher’s desk when my name was called.</p>
<p><span>RECREATION</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Games and play were a small part of our life.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Activity in the line of duties more or less important, involving occasional novelty or the satisfaction of curiosity was where we had to find an outlet for any thought of recreation.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>No boy or girl old enough to perform even the smallest duties ever had much time to think of what they would do with their leisure–each morning called them to take their place in the seeming never-ending tasks about the farm.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Also children were too widely separated to easily get together for group amusement.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>About the only place that any mixed group might gather for united play was the little time we were free about the school.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>So in saying anything about games the natural association is the school ground a few minutes before the bell rang if you were fortunate enough to get your home chores done early.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Then there was recess which was our best opportunity.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When school was out there could be no lingering on the playground or on the way home as each evening brought its inevitable duties and they could not be avoided. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In discussing this matter an older brother he writes, “The game at which we older boys spent a large share of our time was cutting wood to keep stoves going.”</p>
<p>A few young people were fortunate enough to possess skates, and boys could have home-made hand-sleds to slide down our crusted hills.</p>
<p>Our games were few.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>One of the most popular was “Duck on the Rock,” sometimes called “Duck and Drake.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The material with which to play it was always at hand on any road or in any field.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This was a game played with a small rock, the “Duck,” about six inches in diameter set on a larger one.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A boy stood near these rocks as keeper.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Other boys standing about twenty feet away each with a rock for throwing, tried to displace the “Duck.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Each took his turn.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If the thrower knocked off the “Duck” he was to run and recover his stone if possible before the keeper could replace the “Duck.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If the keeper did replace it and could tag the thrower before he returned home with his stone the person tagged became the keeper.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If the thrower missed the “Duck,” failing to dislodge it, he could make no effort to recover his stone and had to wait until someone dislodged the “Duck,” so that at times four or five boys were madly rushing to regain their stones.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A brother reminds me that at school one day he was keeper and just as he replaced the “Duck,” and his hand still on it, a boy threw and caught his thumb and split it open.</p>
<p>Another game was played by setting up a goal of two stones about four feet apart.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A boy stood between these stones with a stout stick.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Another boy stood at some distance with a thin block about an inch thick, sawed from a birch or maple log about 7 inches in diameter.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This he rolled with the purpose of having it pass between the stones and the keeper must try to stop it with his stick.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>An individual amusement grew out of this game which was rolling this same kind of disc along the road or any reasonably level space to see how straight we could roll it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Of course we played “Hide and Seek,” and “Tag.”</p>
<p>One of the delights of a potato field was the use we made of the see-balls which form when the blossom fades.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We would pluck these balls and cutting or breaking off a slender flexible twig about two feet long from a neighboring bush or tree, clean the bark from the tip, and then spearing one of these ball would see how far we could throw it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>With a group of boys the competition supplied healthful and innocent amusement. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>I realize that all these things seem so commonplace that they are hardly worth recording but they are consistent with the simple life we lived--and are an additional confirmation of our dependence upon things immediately available.</p>
<p>One of our novel enjoyments in the springtime was the making of whistles out of section of hazel, alder or willow.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>From the large end between two side twigs, take a smooth section of branch about six inches long.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Cut the end of the stock at an angle of about 45<span>°</span>, making a clean single cut.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The sharp edge of this is now cut off square to make the mouthpiece.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This is a delicate operation for the bark is apt to crush or split if the knife is dull or the hand unskillful.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Next place the knife edge about half an inch back from the end of the mouthpiece and cut straight toward the center of the branch, about one-fourth of the way through.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A three-cornered piece is now cut out.</p>
<p>The knife edge is placed at the middle of the stick and a cut is made through the bark in a perfect circle round the stick. Then take the knife by the blade and resting the whistle end of the stick on the knee strike firmly but gently the part of the stick between the ring and the mouthpieces.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Only the wooden part of the handle touches the bark; metal might bruise it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Go over it until every spot on its surface has felt this light blow.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The laying the knife aside, grasp the stick with a firm hand below the ring in the bark, with the right hand hole the pounded end. Try it with a careful twist.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If it sticks back to the knee it goes for more tapping. When twisted again, it slips, and the bark comes off smoothly in one piece.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The stick is white under the bark and shines and looks slippery.</p>
<p>Begin about an inch from where the circle had been made in the bark, cut toward the straight jog, where the chip was taken out, paring the wood away with a sloping cut.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This will form an air chamber when the bark is replaced.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Now cut a thin slice off the wood between the edge of the vertical cut and the end of the mouth piece.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Put the peeled end of the stick into your mouth turning it until it is thoroughly wet.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Take the section of the bark and slip it back into place, fitting the parts nicely together. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The whistle is finished.</p>
<p>Novelty was introduced by seeing how small a twig or how large a one we could use, so we made tiny ones less than 3/16 of an inch in diameter and others larger than an inch.</p>
<p>Among our limited selection of toys we made a simple pop-gun out of a section of goosequill.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>For this we whittled a wooden plunger and for ammunition we cut a slice of raw potato about 3/16 of an inch thick.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We then pressed an end of the goose-quill into the potato, a piece of which fitted tightly into the quill. Then the plunger was forced through the quill creating a body of compressed air which shot the ammunition for some distance, at least far enough to hit someone in the side of the face. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This anticipated the blow-gun for shooting spit-balls.</p>
<p><span>MEDICINE</span></p>

<p>Educated physicians were very few in relation to the population and necessarily the small and obscure hamlets were many times situated at an impossible distance from medical service as these physicians naturally located in the more thickly populated districts.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Our nearest doctor was at Bathurst about 18 miles distant and it was hardly necessary to say that during winter and the early spring months the narrow dirt roads were often impassable.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was a common occurrence each winter for the entire community of men to appear after a heavy snowstorm with horses, oxen and sleds, and armed with shovels to open up the roads for travel and especially that the children might get to school. Whittier has well described such experiences in his graphic poem “Snow-bound.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Any such community as ours was therefore fortunate to have a few of those choice souls, sympathetic men and women, wise in common sense who gave without thought of reward or convenience their unlimited service to any unfortunate neighbor.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Through experience they had learned simple first aid in accidents and nearly every family had their home-prepared remedies, or the best that any neighbor had was never denied.</p>
<p>For such services my father and mother were constantly in demand in these hours of need.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They were resourceful and efficient.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Their quiet sense of assurance induced faith and confidence in their ability.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Mother’s presence was especially requested in cases of childbirth.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When one sees the elaborate equipments and safeguards of a modern maternity hospital it is almost amazing to look back upon those days when the vast majority of infants were brought into the world in safety to both mother and child without any ministration of a physician, both being dependent upon some neighbor woman as midwife and nurse with nothing at hand but the common prophylactics cleanliness and common sense.</p>
<p>It was most unusual to find a woman who could not nurse her child at the breast and it is interesting to note that they continued to do this with a normal child for a period of form nine to fifteen months and in the case of a weak or sickly child this might continue for two years.</p>
<p>Harvey’s revolutionary theory regarding the circulation of the blood was generally known but its therapeutic values were not scientifically extended due to ignorance and prejudice.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>So in that day we were still far from reaping its benefits.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The year in which my grandfather Henry was born Jenner made his discovery of inoculation for smallpox and this too was slow of acceptance and met with long and vigorous opposition.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>About the year my mother was born ether and chloroform were discovered.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Up to this time all operations and amputation sere performed without a single alleviation and often with crude instruments.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Years later were to come the discoveries of Koch and Lister regarding germs and infections.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Contagions were a thing not understood and therefore not guarded against.</p>
<p>Techniques in all these matters were slow of dissemination and each new idea fought a desperate battle against conservatism and prejudice both on the part of the doctor and the patient.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The history of medicine for the period is full of quackery and experimentation.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>All these things must be taken into consideration to get some idea of the trials of the people in disease and accident.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Hospitals were not available.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There was but one in the Province and that was located at St. John and had been in existence only a few years.</p>
<p>Whiskey, rum, brandy and spirits (alcohol)--occasionally there was wine--were habitual beverages.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Most of these hard liquors came into the British Isles through trade with the West Indies and these settlers brought their desires and appetites and the means of satisfaction with them, for Provincial trade continued the supply.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is almost shocking to read the figures showing the amount of rum alone annually imported about the middle of the nineteenth century. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is difficult to believe it could all have been for human consumption.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>These liquors were to our people a dependable medicine.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Almost the first question when some internal physical disorder arose, was, “Is there any whiskey or brandy in the house?”</p>
<p>Besides these they brought also their familiar ale and porter.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Then some lighter drinks were made at home.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A wine was made form elder berries.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A hop-beer was made by steeping a pound of hops in two gallons of water, all strained.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Add a cupful of yeast.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Sweeten with molasses.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Put in a wooden keg.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Add some warm water and let ferment, or “work” as it was generally called.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Then there was a “Sprue Beer.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>An essence of spruce could be purchased in bottles in the stores.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The necessary amount was added to brewed hops, sweetened with molasses or brown sugar and set working the same as hop-beer.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>These beverages were refreshing and healthful and only slightly stimulating, but unlike the hard liquors were not considered as having medicinal value.</p>
<p>Our common children’s diseases were measles, mumps, whooping-cough and scarlet fever, with occasionally cases of diphtheria.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As a general disease “Consumption” was quite prevalent.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There was also some smallpox.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Consumption was not known to be contagious and like all other contagious or infectious diseases there was no though of isolation, with the natural result that in many cases the disease would run through the family and even into the schools.</p>
<p>Mumps were given no special care and ran their course.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A child with measles was five hot drinks and kept warm; whooping-cough was treated with a cough medicine and the chest and back rubbed usually with goose grease and turpentine.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A group of three small children died rather suddenly of virulent scarlet fever in a near community and the family created quite a scandal and sensation by burying them all in the garden.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Baby colic was relieved with a drop of laudanum in sugar and water, or a dose of the long reliable “Perry Davis Painkiller.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The usual cathartics were Senna, Castor-oil and Epsom Salts.</p>
<p>Frost-bite of hands, feet, ears, and faces, which was common in our severe winters was treated by rubbing the part affected with snow or putting in cold water to draw the frost and then cared for the same burn.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And non one can forget the big cup or jar that held the supply of sulphur and molasses which was our daily dose of spring tonic.</p>
<p>Native herbs were a major part of every medicine cupboard.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Anyone informed about the long list of herbs found and used by the American colonist farther south will perhaps be surprised at the few used by us.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>About September housewives made it their business to go into the neighboring woods to get their needed supply.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When the leaves were used the whole plant was cut and tied in bunches and hung up in some part of the house to dry.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Roots could be dug at almost any time and were usually found in burned-over ground.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Gold-thread was used to make a mouth wash to relieve cankers; etc.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Sarsaparilla and wormwood were blood-purifiers.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Sarsaparilla was steeped in water, mixed with salts and sweetened with brown sugar.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Wormwood was also steeped and could be diluted if too strong.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Mint (spearmint, peppermint) grew wild on the banks of brooks, but was also much cultivated in gardens.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was gathered, bound in bunches and dried.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The leaves and stalks of the plant were steeped to obtain the essence which was used for stomach trouble, especially colic, by mixing in hot water.</p>
<p>The plantain, a flat plant with large oval shaped leaves, which is so plentiful in all north-east America and was called “White-man’s Foot” or “Englishman’s Foot” by the Indians because it was brought here by the first settlers, the seed being mixed in their grain which they brought for planting--has a long and illustrious history in healing.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The people of India used it in snake-bites.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Our people set much store by it for putting on sores and cuts for allaying inflammation.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When needed we plucked the necessary leaves which could usually be found just outside any door.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Then dip in boiling water, rub a little lard or oil on the under side of the leaf and apply to the sore.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Cabbage leaves were often used in the same way and were considered a little milder.</p>
<p>When a well-fed goose was killed for the table and roasted it usually gave off a good supply of fat.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This was carefully saved as it was considered very valuable in many sicknesses.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was used alone or in combination with turpentine for rubbing on the chest and back for colds or lung infections.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Of course the ole, tried and still popular mustard plasters were always relied upon for the same purpose.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Added to these was a cough medicine made of horehound and wormwood boiled down to a concentrated tea and to offset its extreme bitterness it was sweetened with molasses.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If more than an emergency supply was made it was kept from spoiling by adding a small quantity of brandy or other alcoholic liquor.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A small amount of this was a dose.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Quinine was also extensively used for colds.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Bear grease and skunk oil “tried out” or rendered from the fat of these animals was much used, the latter being considered most helpful for stiff joints and aching muscles.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Poultices were made of a variety of materials.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Flour and molasses for bringing boils to a head and drawing out pus.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Grated potato was also used.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Flax-seed was very efficacious in infected cuts or sores, and boils.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A hot onion poultice was helpful in colds and also neuralgia or earache.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Salves were made from hazel bark and lard and rosin and also form the bark of the elder.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>With these simples--without any medical or other scientific knowledge our pioneer folk healed wounds and infections, eased pain and held death at bay by means and methods which to us now seem bizarre and unbelievable, if not bordering on the miraculous.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The medical fraternity and even some of us laugh at some of the things they did, but we too laugh at many of the medical practices of the so-called educated doctors of the time.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>All these herbs carry what to us are common and familiar names.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Yet with the development of medicine and the modern drug store with its prepared tonics and salves and ointments, they are but plants, or even weeds, uninteresting, ignored and often unrecognized except by the herbalist or trained pharmacist.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But in my boyhood days they were closely identified with vital uses, and any and all of them if questioned will lead us into strange lands, and among strange people with peculiar customs, and we will travel back through centuries of time to find their essences and names in the beginnings of recorded history and even embalmed in the legendary lore of primal races.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They have been elements in charms and mystic rituals.--their odors and incense have floated above sacred altars--they were arbiters of life and death--romance and tragedy are woven into their histories--their story holds chapter of the evolution of medicine from the wild guesses and charms of the voodoo priest to the most modern laboratory of science.</p>
<p>What you and I today call a garden of herbs is a pageant of history.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It holds a great chapter of the story of man’s struggle to conquer sickness and pain.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If you only knew as you walked there in the twilight and crushed the mint leaves, or drew a spray of tangy wormwood or thyme through your fingers, or lifted some delicate blossom--if you only knew the essence in the heart of it--that shaded corner would become a dark mystery of an African forest echoing with demonic chants--that sun-lit plot a far-off island of Cathay--that tangle of shrubs by the fence an East Indian jungle with fallen idols in forgotten temples and shrines--or in imagination one hears the distant rattle and drum-beat of the Indian medicine man.</p>
<p>One of my earliest afflictions was at my teething time. From some cause abscesses developed in the gums and affected almost my entire throat.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Mother informed me that the flesh under my jaws was a mass of open sores some so large and deep that one could almost put a finger in them.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>With no professional medical care except occasional lancing by an old neighbor who was considered a good veterinary, and common sense home remedies the disease gradually cleared but left a number of irregular scars on the surface--some even showing on the side of my face.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Under modern medical care such a condition is healed without any evidence of a scar.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Through it all, I am informed, I also retained a fine spirit and gave little complaint or trouble.</p>
<p>I was quite young, perhaps about 4, when I had whooping-cough.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I can remember running out barefooted on the cold frosty ground with the careless spirit of childhood.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>One reason for mentioning this is that a writer of near that period states that the common name for this disease in New Brunswick was “Chincough,” and on looking in an up-to-date dictionary I find the term is still in good usage--but am informed that this term applies only to very mild cases.</p>
<p>In the history of medical theory and practice the investigator will find as interesting a rubbish heap as may be found by any archeologist in the debris of a long buried and forgotten city.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>During my boyhood days we were beginning to emerge from one of these now discarded vagaries known as blood-letting.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This practice had a long and peculiarly interesting history.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Venesection is still occasionally resorted to but such an indiscriminate practice as blood-letting came to be, has long been an outcast by all schools of medicine and surgery.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In my reading on this subject I came upon this rather naive statement, “Blood-letting was much resorted to for the purpose of relieving the results of over-eating.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>To any reader familiar with the gluttonous living of the upper classes during the period in which this practice reached its most extravagant acceptance such a remark would seem to contain much reason.</p>
<p>It was my own experience while still small to be once subject to this practice.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The exact reason is now out of mind but I have a picture of myself lying in mother’s big bed and a man coming in--an old, long-bearded man--and baring my right leg and then taking a slender lancet he forced its sharp blade into my groin and drew off an amount of blood.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I still retain the scar of that incision.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Mother recalls being bled on three separate occasions to relieve headaches.</p>
<p>Yet with all that our doctors lacked professionally they were endued with a spirit of service and the demands made upon them called for a self-sacrifice and devotion, often without reward, which at times demonstrated a heroism which perhaps has never been duly recognized and honored.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They should be given a prominent place in the group of pioneers--the trail-blazers, trappers, voyagers and home-builders--who redeemed the wilderness.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They are a real part of a glorious company.</p>
<p>Fatal sickness in our little community was very rare and I recall only once that death came near to us.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My Uncle Stevens died. I was a familiar visitor there but with death in the house a mystery and dread came upon it and I went to it with halting steps.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As I went through the gate and crossed the barnyard I saw two neighbors with clean fresh boards at work upon a long box and I knew from what I heard that this was the coffin in which they would put his body.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I passed hurriedly into the house.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Later in that box I saw a white, still, bearded face.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The neighbors all came and they took him away and buried him in the church-yard at Clifton about six miles away.</p>
<p>For the fist time I had met Death</p>
<p><span>RELIGION</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Our people held deep--seated theological convictions within the circle of their rituals.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They were Roman Catholics, Presbyterians, and Episcopalians.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Other and dissenting groups could be found in larger communities.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Practically all were of the old school: believers in Original Sin and Infant Damnation.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The Episcopalians sent a minister into the community about once each year to take care of any baptisms or “christenings” of children born since his last visit.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If in the interim imminent death appeared possible for an infant some lay officer of the Church could baptize according to the form and words in the Prayer Book and in the event of death it was safe for heaven, but if it recovered it must be baptized by a duly consecrated successor of the Apostles to save it from Hell.</p>
<p>These men and women argued and settled the destinies of men and nations by the doctrines of Fee-will and Predestination never for a moment understanding the logic of either.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In that day orthodoxy rested itself on the statement of fatalistic predestination, “What is to be will be, if it never come to pass.”</p>
<p>Throughout the Dominion we heard of disturbances and riots between Orangemen, those restless, vindictive Ulster men whose fiery descendants are yet fighting the Battle of the Boyne, and Roman Catholics, but at our own door they were kind neighbors.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Mother testifies to the fact that our three Catholic neighbors were the best friends and supporters she had in her schoolwork, and she Protestant Irish.</p>
<p>A type of theological reasoning is aptly described by an argument presented on any provocation by an old Uncle.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He was an ardent defender of the theory that the world was square and flat.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Often have I seen him heated for battle.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>His eyes would flash and his brows bristle.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In his excitement he would pull his discolored T.D. from his mouth and wave it in the air, while spittle flowed slowly over his lower lip onto his close-cropped beard, as in quaint resonant Irish brogue he climaxed with, “The Book says--the Book says, ‘the wind blows form the four corners of the earth’ and by me faith ‘tis true and that’s the end on it” (Rev. 7:1).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And that was the “end on it.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There was scientific and ecclesiastical finality.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Anyone questioning it was an infidel or atheist.</p>
<p>These choice but simple souls have passed a long time ago.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They were good neighbors.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>After all what greater praise. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>God rest their souls.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They are beyond all questions of Pope or Primate, Episcopacy, Presbytery or Dissenter.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Their memory recalls the immortal lines of Robert Burns:</p>
<p>“The Power, incens’d, the pageant will desert,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The pompous strain, the sacerdotal stole;</p>
<p>But haply in some cottage far apart</p>
<p>May hear, well pleased, the language of the soul,</p>
<p>And in His book of life the inmates poor enrol.”</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The religious activities of our community were extremely limited.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There was no church building.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>On very rare occasions and only in case of urgent need did a Catholic priest visit the neighborhood.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>On occasions of special communion or service the few Catholic families attended Church at Clifton or Bathurst.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I recall only once attending in a religious service in our schoolhouse.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This was one of those rare, usually yearly, visits of an Episcopalian minister.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is a faded memory.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Only the schoolroom, the familiar folk and the minister, a young man with a pleasing face and dark hair and wearing a short, waist-length vestment of white bordered in black.</p>
<p>One of the unique situations regarding religious instruction was the common practice of schoolmasters teaching the children of all groups their Catechisms.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Regardless of the doctrinal convictions or church connection of the teacher the families requested that this be done in the schoolroom at a time set by the teacher.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Here indeed was an unusual picture.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A Catholic coaching a Presbyterian, Episcopalian or others, each in their own Catechism or any one of these Protestant teachers doing the same for a Catholic group or any of their usually antagonistic and critical Protestant denominational adherents. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Our community was very strict about the Sabbath and did not labor on that day.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We had no church service.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was a day of sociability.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The people visited from house to house, gossiped, relayed news, told stories and drank tea.</p>
<p>Realizing the need for the children of her neighbors, mother, in spite of her duties as home keeper for a growing family and often her busy life as a schoolteacher, gathered all the children possible at the schoolhouse on Sunday afternoon for a Bible study one summer.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The method was simple.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She would have the child read a verse from the Bible and then raise questions and talk about it so as to get at the truth it contained.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Here there was opportunity to be more fee in thinking and expressing as questions and answers were not stereotyped as in the Catechisms.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This open study of the Bible without doctrinal and theological limitation or comment and the absence of denominational exercises was laying unconsciously the grounds of freedom which under later conditions and new friends caused our family to have a complete change of loyalty to a very different religious group.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But this is a story which does not belong in this record.</p>
<p>Marriages were performed by ministers in the home or at the church.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Am not informed if any civil officer could perform a marriage ceremony.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Some Churches required a “reading of the bans” at the Church service for three consecutive Sundays.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A marriage license cost about $6.00. There seems to have been no stipulated fee for the minister.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Mother tells of one man who gave the minister a couple of quarts of shelled barley.</p>
<p>When death came women usually cared for the bodies of women and children and older men took care of the men.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The body was bathed and dressed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The eyes were closed and the lids set with our large copper pennies.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Coffins were made as needed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A couple of men, the best carpenters, made them of boards and usually covered them with a thin black cotton cloth.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Handles were put on the sides for carrying.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Some friends or neighbors sat up with the body during the nights until the funeral which was held usually on the third day.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Liquor was often served freely to these watchers and also to everybody attending the funeral.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Irish Catholic funerals nearly always included a “wake” which was always an hilarious affair with smoking, eating and much drinking.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Father told of one which he attended where the men took the body from the coffin, stuck a clay pipe in his mouth and stood him in the corner.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Tales of such excesses were rather common.</p>
<p>At the funeral service at home or in the church the minister read the prescribed form from the Prayer book, also the Committal at the grave.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>At times it was not possible to secure a minister and the service might be read by some layman or there was no service at all.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>No use was made of flowers.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The coffin was conveyed to the graveyard on a wagon or on a sled if in winter.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Graveyards were located usually in the grounds adjoining the Church and so were commonly called churchyards and in the towns every church had a burial ground.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This of course was the continuance of British custom.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Everyone remained at the grave until the opening was filled.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The digging of the grave and the refilling was usually the duty of the “sexton” or caretaker of the Church.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Only out-of-town and local relatives returned with the family to the home.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>At the time of a death the women of the household and very near female relatives immediately prepared black clothes and heavy black veils, very full, to be worn at the funeral and often this conspicuous mourning was worn for years, some women continuing to do so all their lives.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In any study of funeral practices it is quite interesting to not how many customs although of pagan origin still persist.</p>
<p>Christmas was an event. Santa Claus was a reality. We hung our stockings or our socks behind the stove.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was a children’s day.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There was the simple exciting expectancy for Christmas Eve.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>No modern child with a Christmas ruined by commercialism and debunked with realism ever wakened to greet the morning with more eagerness and sincere satisfaction than we did.</p>
<p>It was primarily a home celebration.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There were no exercises in the schools.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Christmas trees were unknown.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In the towns where there were churches a service was held and if anyone went from a community as far away as we were the trip used up most of the day.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In the neighborhood it was a visiting day and everyone dressed in his or her best and as they went they drank tea with at times a “nip” of something stronger that left some men in a rather confused mental state by the close of the day.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>In the home we hung up our stockings and found in them on Christmas morning some “boughten” peppermint candy, nuts, perhaps some that had been gathered in the woods in the fall and hidden away for the occasion, bunch raisins, an apple, and round cookies which had been baked a few days before, secretly if possible for a surprise, and the “if possible” should be double underscored.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>These cookies were occasionally made more attractive by spotting the tops with caraway seeds.</p>
<p>Toys and dolls were rarely ever seen and the giving of presents was not thought of.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A special treat for Christmas dinner was a cured ham baked–its outside stuck full of cloves; or perhaps we and a roast goose.</p>
<p>My most delectable memory is of the apples we received.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They were round and yellow with a deep-pink shaded blush spot on one side.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We thought they came from Nova Scotia and were a part of the contents of mysterious packages brought from the distant town store.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Throughout the years I have never been able to rid myself of their aroma.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I have eaten choice apples across the continent, from the Atlantic to the Pacific, but I have never found anything comparable.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They must have been surrounded with the spices of Arby.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Someone braved the dragon and the nymphs and brought to our secluded world some of those golden apples such as Gaea gave as a wedding gift to Hera.</p>
<p><span>FAREWELL AND HAIL</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>All these things wove themselves into the warp and woof of our daily living but as the years passed an da large family was growing up my parents faced a real problem.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Individuals and families had gone to the States.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As they returned on visits and their letters came there was always the story of a country with a future.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Factories, employment, schools.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Here we looked out upon a few acres of virgin soil margined by forest land that challenged a family to endless hard labor and which, even when cut away provided a soil which still demanded incessant labor and promised often only the barest necessities.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And always as with so many other families there was that constant tempting call of a new and attractive country that would one day lure one boy after another and end in the eventual brake-up of the family.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>So at last the decision came and unitedly we turned our backs upon the simple and seemingly unpromising backwoods life to find what a new and distant country could offer.</p>
<p>In early April snow was still on the ground.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Tim Savage, a near neighbor, came with his horses and bob-sled into which we packed ourselves and our few personal possessions and the great adventure was begun. As we turned north just beyond the bend in the road we stopped a few moments to say “Good-bye” to the Sealy family.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Bathurst was eighteen miles away.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Jarred and shaken often by the uneven road with its ruts and bumps, lulled at times by the monotonous clip-clop of the horses feet as they struck the hardened snow and ice, the jingle of the little round bells on the harness and the tedious, narrow, wood-bordered, deadly-quiet road; but buoyed by excitement and expectation, we came at last to the end of the first stage of our journey.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We spent over-night with an uncle and then began the long, tiring, but thrilling train ride to Saint John.</p>
<p>Remembrance of a face pressed against a cold glass window watching the fascinating, never-ending coming and going of telegraph poles, the sharp hitting of the wheels on the rail-joints, the grinding of the hand brakes, the warning whistles, the clang of the bell, the hiss of escaping steam, the stations and people coming and going and all the mixed confusion and cries.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A blurred memory of a busy city–wharves and ships and a great white steamer.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>All a faded dram of a sleepy child.</p>
<p>The great white side-wheeler steamer sailed out of Saint John Harbor in the late afternoon and turned west through the Bay of Fundy, passing Grand Manan Island and on through Passamaquoddy Bay and then along the shore of Maine in the gathering night.</p>
<p>A new family with small earthly possessions would soon be landing in the States, one of that large number that had already found homes in Maine and the forerunner of many others from New Brunswick who have applied their morality, intelligence and industry to the building of homes, institutions, cities and villages in new England.</p>
<p>In the meantime the cold winds of the Atlantic blow across the decks.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The steamer plows with a shivering motion through the seemingly endless waves.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The great arched boxes on the side resound with a continuously intermittent splash and rumble as the water falls back from the churning paddles.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The hours pass in an otherwise silent night.</p>
<p>Morning breaks in cold grey across the wide expanse of rolling water.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My last record is the picture of a small boy dressed in homemade, gray, homespun clothes with long pants and short Eton type coat, lying flat on his face in an isolated spot upon a lower, roughly splintered freight deck, disconsolate in the bitterness of his first seasickness.</p>

<p><span>MEMORIES</span></p>
<p>Memories are words writ large</p>
<p>Across the face of time–</p>
<p>Bedewed with tears,</p>
<p>Sun-checked with smiles.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Names, faces, deeds,</p>
<p>That touch us once again with fire;</p>
<p>Or calm us like faint odors</p>
<p>Out of gardens half-forgot.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Words set to music</p>
<p>That stills our restless feet,</p>
<p>And calls them down</p>
<p>Alluring pathways of the past.</p>

<p>Elizabeth Henry’s maiden name was Elizabeth Smith</p>
<p>Born April 09, 1844 Salmon Beach, New Brunswick, Canada</p>
<p>Married June 13, 1865, Clifton, New Brunswick, Canada</p>
<p>Died Abt. 1939, Portland, Cumberland, Maine</p>
<p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This mention of New Bandon where mother’s parents were married recalls two things. First, a quotation from Johnston’s “American Notes” written about fifteen years after they left there. “The crops of oats and potatoes were good and large, and the stubble ploughing very good. The settlers, mostly Roman Catholic Irish, originally from Bandon, in the County of Cork, are for the most part miserable clothed, keeping wretched looking houses, have much dirt about the doors of their dwellings, and their land and fences for the most part, in an untidy condition. It is “Ould Ireland” all over again planted here, little altered from its home appearance and fashions. And it is so, most probably, because the settlers came direct from their own country to this, and have had little opportunity, since they left their island homes, of either seeing or being taught anything not practiced there.”</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Some of the sting may be taken out of this rather ugly description by stating that the writer of the above consistently shows a rather keen antagonism to all southern Irish emigrants.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The second is an item taken from a recent traveler who has written a guide to Ireland. Speaking of Bandon in the County of Cork, he says: “Bandon where the pigs are Protestants, was a planted town with defenses and walls ninety feet high. The story goes that on Bandon bridge was written; ‘Turk, Jew and Athiest may enter here, but not a Papist.’ Somebody who came that way added the rhyme:</p>
<p>‘He who wrote this wrote it well</p>
<p>For the same is written on the gates of hell.’</p>
<p>This euflet was commonly attributed to Dean Swift.”</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The shop was one in which she sold pins and needles, thread, and cotton goods—a small dry-goods store.</p>
<p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Thinking of all the Protestant folk who came from County Cork it is interesting to quote this item from the “Reader’s Digest” (Nov. 1938). “An endowment dated 1683 provided for the ‘relief of seven aged Protestants in the County of Cork, Ireland.’ For the last 50 or 60 years the trustees have been unable to find seven aged Protestants of any kind in all County Cork.”</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The steamer referred to was undoubtedly the “Savannah” which was the first steamer to cross the Atlantic from America. In 1819 she sailed from Savannah, Georgia, to Liverpool (probably visiting other Irish harbours) and then went on to St. Petersburg. She was a 350 ton side-wheeler and fitted with sails. The time of crossing to Liverpool was twenty-five days. As it was not possible to carry the necessary amount of fuel to keep up the steam most of the voyage was made under sail.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>When the modern mind is so informed regarding the swift, commodious and luxurious passenger steamers plying between America and Europe it is practically impossible, unless one reads the record, to imagine the discomfort and often tragedy of an ocean voyage on a sailing vessel in the late 18<sup>th</sup> or early 19<sup>th</sup> century.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>	Stop and itemize a few things – small vessels utterly inadequate in room or conveniences to accommodate the 150 or more passengers – small unsanitary cabins below decks, crowded with sick and dirty people, often diseased – the deadly monotony of six to ten weeks at sea with all the uncertainties of ocean’s moods – food limited in variety and quantity, and of questionable quality, with no refrigeration nor modern scientific methods of preservation, this and much more. Maritime history of immigration to America during those early years tells an unpleasant, revolting, and at times ghastly story. Many came from the British Isles in sailing vessels which had taken out cargoes of lumber and fish and furs and were returning under ballast. Suffering, sickness and death were passengers on practically every vessel.</p>
<p>	The pressure of economic need, the consciousness of a fixed or uncertain future that was galling to spirits that wished freedom and the opportunity of initiative for themselves and their children were the forces operating in Europe, and America offered an asylum, a land of privilege, and the reported or imagined hardships of the ocean voyage were discounted by the glowing prospects of life that awaited at the end.</p>
<p>	Such things as these must be borne in mind for an intelligent appraisal of the sacrifices made by our immigrant ancestors of more than a century ago.</p>

<p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Only one possession of my grandfather Henry remains to us. It is a damaged two-volume Bible with notes and steel-engraved illustrations with a few pages missing. It was published at Dublin, Ireland in 1814 and is said to be the first printing of an English Bible departing from the Elizabethan use of “f” for “s” when two”s’s” came together.</p>
<p>	As I recall the story from the lips of my grandmother it was published in sections on subscription at a total cost of about $100.00. The sections were then bound in two volumes with covers of heavy binder’s board finished over with full calf-skin. Grandfather purchased this book while serving his apprenticeship during his youth in Ireland. He served seven years as a bookkeeper and was a perfect penman.</p>
<p>	A page between the Testaments contains the family record with the date of his marriage and the birth dates of his children, of which my father was the youngest. All of this in his own fine clear hand-writing.</p>

<p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Armagh is the ecclesiastical capital of Ireland, owing its supremacy to Saint Patrick, who was its first bishop, built the first cathedral and made Armagh the head See of all Ireland. The school which he founded became one of the most famous centers of learning in all Ireland, having 3000 students and a “Saxon quarter”. The “Book of Armagh” is an illuminated treasure from the early ninth century. Brign Boru was buried in Armagh. It counts for much in the councils of the Catholic Church, being the headship of world-wide Irish faith. It is the Primacy of the Church of Ireland, which claims its own descent from St. Patrick. Navin Fort, near Armagh, was the site of Emain Macha, the palace of the Kings of Ulster and the head quarters of the Red Branch Knights.” (Encyc. Brit.)</p>
<p>Stoves were a recent invention and their manufacture a new industry.</p>
<p>The ashes from these various burnings added a vital quality to the soil or, if the material burned was hard word, the ashes could be used in making soap.</p>
<p>But it was wasteful of good tillable land as a plow could not be run into these angles.</p>

<p>The principle of interweaving warp and woof still remains the fundamental operation even in the most complicated modern machinery used in the production of fabrics.</p>
<p>Walking in the silent wood sone is halted by the drumming of a partridge or startled by the echoing “whir” of its noisy wings as it rises suddenly from the ground, roused from its covert by an intruder, and you watch it until it lights upon a high branch of a great beech tree where it cranes its neck in apprehensive curiosity.</p>
<p>The yellow-throated clusters of the potato blooms held always an appealing beauty which would be more noticeable if the individual plant were isolated rather than seen as it is in great fields.</p>
<p>A little later, out in the meadow, will come the English daisy with its white elongated petals and yellow center--a flower which brings to mind the sentimental maiden as she plucks the petals with the pensive query, “He loves me, he loves me not.”</p>
<p>The ground floor had a large room used as kitchen and dining room where the tables were set for the workmen, and at one end were two bedrooms.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>These rooms were about eight feet high with board ceiling.</p>
<p>It was below a big shed that was at the back for provisions.</p>
<p>With the introduction of the steel pen which was now supplanting the quill, we were entering upon the third period of such instruments–the earliest, lasting form the beginning of the art of writing among the Egyptians to the fall of the Roman Empire, being that of the split reed.</p>
<p>The mention of this old gentleman, a Mr. eddy, recalls a story about him which still remains in the memory of old neighbors.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The Province was taking a census and officials were interviewing all heads of families.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>One of these men came and among other questions asked Mr. E. when he was born.</p>
<p>Mr. E.: “I was born in-------, Ireland.</p>
<p>Interviewer: Then are you Irish?”</p>
<p>Mr. E.: “No, I am not Irish.”</p>
<p>Interviewer: “Why not? If you were born in Ireland then you must be Irish.”</p>
<p>Mr. E.: “I suppose if I was born in a pig-pen I would be a pig.”</p>
<p>From such a practice one can readily see the origin of the expression, “Stealing pennies off a dead man’s eyes.”</p>
