<div class="reader-summary">Comprehensive background essay (dated January 19, 2005) by Don Glendenning on Scottish and Irish immigration to Canada in the late 1700s–early 1800s. Explains causes: aftermath of the Scottish Rebellion and outlawing of the clan system (1745), wool price increases displacing tenant farmers, religious persecution, and poverty. Details the harsh immigration experience and Grosse Île mortality. Features an extended first-person account from 1897 newspaper interview with Mary Ann Harley (b. 1799, Courtmasherry, Ireland), Don&#x27;s great-great-grandmother, recounting her 1822 emigration, the Battle of Waterloo celebration, the first steamship in Cork Harbor, her brother William (a government surveyor), her 75-mile walk through forests to Newcastle, and marriage to John Henry. Includes sections on coats of arms, clans, and tartans. Demonstrates Don&#x27;s scholarly approach to understanding his family&#x27;s historical context.</div>

<p>	BACKGROUND</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Introduction</b><b></b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The surge of Scottish settlers in the late 1700’s may be attributed to a number of events.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>First was the Scottish Rebellion followed by an outlawing of the clan system by an Act of Parliament in 1745.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Scots were required to take an oath not to carry weapons and never use Highland garb.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Also in the late 1700’s there was a great increase in the price of wool and mutton.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This resulted in tenant farmers being turfed from the land and replaced by large sheep farms. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>It is obvious from my family names that most of my ancestors came from the British Isles - Scotland and England mostly but a few from Ireland as well.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>So far, I have not found a Welsh connection.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Of course, if one reaches back a bit further, one then finds a connection to continental Europe.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>People left their homes to come to Canada for many reasons including:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>escape from political unrest, religious strife and war</p>
<p>getting away from poverty and crowded slums</p>
<p>breaking with the rigid social class structure</p>
<p>start a new adventure and a new life</p>
<p>an alternative to serving time in prison</p>
<p>being forced out as tenant farmers</p>
<p>religious persecution</p>
<p>to become masters of their own fate</p>
<p>see for themselves the land where trees yielded sugar, soap and fuel</p>
<p>taking up land offered at the close of military service.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Immigrants were often at the mercy of promoters, profiteers and land speculators.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The journey by sea was long, overcrowded and difficult; many did not reach the new land.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>On Grose Isle, at the mouth of the Saint Lawrence River, over five thousand people who endured the passage lie buried. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>As of the time of writing, I do not know where any of my ancestors they first set foot on solid ground in the new w land.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is likely, however, that it was Cape Breton, Pictou, Halifax, Saint John, the Miramichi of Baie Chaleur.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The exception to our not knowing is my great grandmother’s sister, Mary Ann Harley. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span>Mary Ann Harley</span> was born in Courtmasherry, Ireland on 6 February, 1799.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>On her 99<sup>th</sup> birthday, she was interviewed by a newspaper in Portland, Maine where she was living.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The following is a direct quote from that article.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><i>I was born in Courtmasherry, Ireland, February 6, 1799.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This is a small town only a little distance from the city of Cork, near the Bay of Cork.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My maiden name was Mary Ann Harley, and my father was a schoolteacher in the town.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I had two brothers and three sisters.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>All dead now.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>One of my sisters lived to be 94, died on her birthday.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I can remember the town where we lived very well, and the names of friends and schoolmates.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I left Ireland in 1822.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I can remember about my father and mother talking about the rising of ‘98; people never seemed to get tired of taking about that event.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My father was of English descent, a Presbyterian and I was raised in the church.</i></p>
<p><i></i><br></p>
<p><i>Very well can I remember the day on which two big ships of war sailed into Cork harbor, their decks crowded with men and their masts with gay flags.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>These ships were bringing us the first news of the battle of Waterloo in which that terror of the world and ogre of history, Napoleon Bonaparte was defeated by our own Duke of Wellington.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>People went crazy with joy; the bells of the city of Cork were rung, and great bonfires were lit in celebration of the great event.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Three of the officers of an Irish regiment were quartered at my father’s house for many days, and I remember some of the stories they had to tell of that terrible fight.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Their bright uniforms and handsome faces made a great impression on me.</i></p>
<p><i></i><br></p>
<p><i>In 1822 I went to visit a lady friend in Queenstown, and while I was there the first steamboat ever to come into Irish waters came into the harbor.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Everyone turned out and lined the docks to the strange craft which moved so swiftly through the waters without sail or oars.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was a wonderful thing then, but I suppose the people of Queenstown see enough such craft now.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>While I was in Queenstown I got a letter from my brother William in America.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He was a government surveyor, and he wanted me to come over as soon as possible as he said he had a young, handsome and wealthy husband waiting for me.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I went home to my parents and it was decided that I would sail for America.</i></p>
<p><i></i><br></p>
<p><i>I was one of 150 passengers on a sailing ship which left Cork on May 7, 1822.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was a terrible voyage.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I was sick almost all the way, and glad to see land after seven weeks and three days aboard that ship.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I landed at a place called Pockshaw on the Bay of Chaleur.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was a very small settlement then, only a few small houses made of logs.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My brother was there waiting for me.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We had to walk 75 miles through the woods to get to his home.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>No roads, no conveyances of any kind, not even a path.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was a trackless forest in which not one tree had been cut.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We made our way by means of compass over windfalls and across brooks to Newcastle.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We were three nights on the road and we had to sleep in the woods without any shelter.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>On the fourth night we got to Newcastle, a very small settlement.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Eight months after my arrival at this place I married John Henry; he was a man of business and agent for a large mercantile firm.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I had nine children and seven grew up and married.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I don’t know how many descendents I have, but they must number in the hundreds.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My husband died 28 years ago (1870) I lived on the Miramichi until after my husband's death, then I came to the States where some of my children lived.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I had a brother named John Harley who built ships on Bolters Island near Newcastle.</i></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>On landing most anywhere in Eastern Canada, settlers found a land covered with forests where wild life roamed in abundance; the air was fresh and both the air and sea provided fresh food.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Their first task was to clear the land and erect shelter for the looming winter - log houses to stem the cold the likes of which they had not experienced before. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p><b>Sources of Information</b><b></b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Information for this history was drawn from many sources.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I was fortunate in having access to the family Bible described in the next section.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Other people have shared information, which they have found.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I also found the following to be especially helpful:</p>

<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Origin of Names</b><b></b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Until about 1000 A.D. most people in Europe had only one name. Later, to distinguish one person from another, a second name was added. The second name was usually taken from the person's occupation, location, father's name, or some characteristic.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Coats of Arms</b><b></b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Knights in battle wore a suit of armour for protection, however, in the heat of battle it was easy to mistake friend for foe. In order to provide a means of quick identification, knights began painting designs on their suits of armour. These designs were also woven into light coats and worn over the armour. Thus originated the term "coat of arms".<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Many early coats of arms had neither crest nor motto; these were later additions. The crest worn above the shield and helmet, was usually used in tournaments but not every knight was eligible to participate. The motto is believed to have originated as a battle cry in the seventeenth century.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>There is really no such thing as a family coat of arms. Coats of arm belong to the chief and are passed down by him through his eldest son. A descendent may, however, apply to the Court of the Lord Lyon of Scotland to have a coat of arms established and registered. A personal coat of arms is usually some variation of that of the ancestral coat of arms.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Clans</b><b></b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Scottish clans are a form of tribal system, which began to take shape in 843 when the Picts and Scots united.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><i>Clann</i> is Gaelic for children and works like an extrended family with a chief as head.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The Chief was responsible for protecting the clan from its enemies, for settling disputes, and for leading the clan in battle.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A clan would often offer protection to a smaller clan, known as septs.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The Glendennings were a sept of the Douglas clan.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Tartans</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>Tartans appear at first to be patterns of cloth found in a community and reflected the local colours and skills of local weavers.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They were associated with the area where one lived rather than the clan to which one belonged.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This began to change, however, in the 18<sup>th</sup> century when tartans were adopted by various clans regardless of where clan members lived.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Blazon of Arms</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>A written description of a coat of arms, called a blazon of arms, was prepared in a mixture of Ancient English, Latin and French when a coat of arms was granted.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The actual design, of graphics, was prepared from the blazon so it is not surprising that there are differences as prepared by different artists.</p>
