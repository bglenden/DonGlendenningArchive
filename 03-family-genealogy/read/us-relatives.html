<p><b>USA Migration</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>We know the precise date that my mother landed in Portland (January 24,1908); we cannot say the same for my father.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We know, however, that he and one or more of his brothers ran a cartage business in Portland prior to 1910.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We also know that some of his first cousins by the name of Henry had moved to the Portland area prior to 1870 and that their mother, his Great Aunt Mary Anne (Harley) Henry moved there after her husband died (1970).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Dad also had first cousins by the name of Knowles living in the US but I do not know the time period.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I believe that Lillian stayed with them when she went to Boston in 1933.</p>
<p><br></p>

<p><b>Earth Quakes</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>According to my sister, Lillian, an earthquake was felt in Black river in 1925.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There was a more recent one but I do not recall the year.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Ken was visiting at John’s and John went into the barn for something.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>While he was in the barn, the quake was felt.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The metal siding on the barn banged as though someone was striking it with a piece of two by four.</p>
