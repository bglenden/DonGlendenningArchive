<p>Morning!  It is very special that we're all connected<br>
online - Robert mentioned it would be great if we <br>
could all get together and share our info - I<br>
suggested that we all meet at a specific time on MSN<br>
-does everyone belong to MSN Messenger Chat?<br>
<br>
Once we all join up to MSN we could meet - I would<br>
suggest around 12 noon PST which is around 8:00 p.m.<br>
in the UK.<br>
<br>
Have a great day!<br>
<br>
Heather<br>

&gt; Hi Heather,<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Sorry for the delay in responding. I am now catching<br>
&gt; up on my email.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; I think that you and I may have corresponded some<br>
&gt; time ago. Your name <br>
&gt; certainly seems familiar to me.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; It seems we are in accord with many of the known<br>
&gt; details.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; I only had a very brief glance at the Coshe Mang<br>
&gt; record. The name may have <br>
&gt; been Denis Hurley. I can't be sure.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; I was in Ireland for 2 weeks the last half of<br>
&gt; September. Spent a few days in <br>
&gt; Dublin because the National Archive, RCBL, and<br>
&gt; National Library are all <br>
&gt; there.Then went to County Cork, starting with Cork<br>
&gt; City to check county <br>
&gt; records. Unfortunately I was only able to visit the<br>
&gt; City Library there <br>
&gt; because the Heritage Centre (located in a former<br>
&gt; Anglican Church) is open <br>
&gt; only on Wednesday's (we arrived on a Thursday) and<br>
&gt; the County Library needs <br>
&gt; a week's notice from anyone wanting to search<br>
&gt; records. Then we went to <br>
&gt; Clonakilty and Bandon just to base ourselves in the<br>
&gt; areas our ancestors came <br>
&gt; from. When we visited Courtmacsherry it was only on<br>
&gt; the road that follows <br>
&gt; the coastline of Courtmacsherry Bay. What we saw was<br>
&gt; a hotel that is located <br>
&gt; where the Earl of Shannon had his summer home. I<br>
&gt; expect that there is also a <br>
&gt; village/town there as well but did not see it.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Because my time was so limited, I concentrated<br>
&gt; almost exclusively on looking <br>
&gt; for records connected to my Knowles family. There<br>
&gt; were a few but not many <br>
&gt; references to Knowles in the records and I did find<br>
&gt; my ggggrandfather <br>
&gt; William Knowles and his wife Hannah. Their son<br>
&gt; William married Elizabeth <br>
&gt; Harley who is presumed to be a daughter of William<br>
&gt; Harley and Ann Bidders. <br>
&gt; We have no confirmation of this. However, if<br>
&gt; Elizabeth was a sister to Mary <br>
&gt; Ann Harley Henry, then Elizabeth's son, John, who<br>
&gt; married Mary Ann's <br>
&gt; daughter Elizabeth Ann Henry, was Elizabeth Ann's<br>
&gt; first cousin.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; I know that Harley and Hurley are sometimes used<br>
&gt; interchangeably but this <br>
&gt; family was very consistent in spelling their name<br>
&gt; "Harley" not "Hurley" at <br>
&gt; least in all of the records I have seen. Of course,<br>
&gt; that may reflect the <br>
&gt; likelihood that, as children of a school teacher,<br>
&gt; they were all literate.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Coshe Mang refers to a series of volumes compiled by<br>
&gt; an American named <br>
&gt; O'Casey who commissioned the copying of large<br>
&gt; numbers of Irish records and <br>
&gt; published them under the title of O'Kiefe, Coshe<br>
&gt; Mang. I understand that <br>
&gt; many libraries with genealogy collections have some<br>
&gt; or all of these volumes. <br>
&gt; Apart from the volume I was shown briefly in<br>
&gt; Ireland, I have not had the <br>
&gt; opportunity to examine any of the information they<br>
&gt; are said to contain.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; I have met William Harley briefly and he was kind<br>
&gt; enough to send me a copy <br>
&gt; of his book (which at the moment is packed away).<br>
&gt; The Harley descendant I <br>
&gt; mentioned is Nancy Harley Newton, an artist who has<br>
&gt; established a good <br>
&gt; reputation in this area. It was at one of her<br>
&gt; exhibits that I met William. I <br>
&gt; can't recall her father's name (I think it starts<br>
&gt; with P maybe Phillip. I <br>
&gt; believe he had a twin sister named Josephine.) but<br>
&gt; if you have William's <br>
&gt; book, you will find her family in it. She has a web<br>
&gt; site at <br>
&gt;<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>HYPERLINK "http://www.nancynewton.com/" <span>http://www.nancynewton.com/</span>  I will mention you to<br>
&gt; her and perhaps it would <br>
&gt; be possible for you to meet her when you are in<br>
&gt; Toronto.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Hope you have not been badly affected by the weather<br>
&gt; we have been hearing <br>
&gt; about in B.C.<br>

&gt; <br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; Hi Bonnie:  My name is Heather Hess - my maiden<br>
&gt; name<br>
&gt; &gt; is Wilson.  I am descended from Mary Ann's brother<br>
&gt; &gt; William Harley, Land Surveyor, who married Ann<br>
&gt; MacLean<br>
&gt; &gt; - d/o Capt. Archibald MacLean.  William and Ann<br>
&gt; moved<br>
&gt; &gt; to Ontario - Ann died in childbirth and William<br>
&gt; died<br>
&gt; &gt; in 1837 and is buried in Stoney Creek Cemetery,<br>
&gt; &gt; Hamilton.<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; I am especially interested in the marriage you<br>
&gt; &gt; mentioned between Denis Harley and Ann Bidders - I<br>
&gt; saw<br>
&gt; &gt; the same record at the LDS but it read as Denis<br>
&gt; Hurley<br>
&gt; &gt; - it was in alphabetical order with a lot of other<br>
&gt; &gt; Hurleys so I don't think it was a mistranslation -<br>
&gt; &gt; perhaps they changed their name to Harley in<br>
&gt; Canada<br>
&gt; &gt; because the Irish weren't well accepted in those<br>
&gt; days.<br>
&gt; &gt; Perhaps Denis' middle name was William - that is a<br>
&gt; &gt; mystery that needs to be solved.  I sure don't<br>
&gt; imagine<br>
&gt; &gt; there was another Ann Bidders living in<br>
&gt; Courtmacsherry<br>
&gt; &gt; in that time period.<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; I'd love to go to Courtmacsherry!  From all the<br>
&gt; photos<br>
&gt; &gt; I've seen it's very beautiful.<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; What is Coshe Mang?<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; There were New Brunswick newspapers at that time -<br>
&gt; I<br>
&gt; &gt; also wonder why there was no obit for Ann Bidders<br>
&gt; &gt; Harley (Hurley).  It is strange because they were<br>
&gt; a<br>
&gt; &gt; very prominent family.  There's no mention of<br>
&gt; where<br>
&gt; &gt; she's buried either - another mystery to be<br>
&gt; solved.<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; William Harley (who wrote the book) is getting on<br>
&gt; now<br>
&gt; &gt; but he goes to the Toronto Research library once a<br>
&gt; &gt; week.  He wrote that 'our' Harley's are descended<br>
&gt; from<br>
&gt; &gt; Harley Street in London but as far as I know<br>
&gt; doesn't<br>
&gt; &gt; have documentation to prove it - I think he has<br>
&gt; word<br>
&gt; &gt; of mouth.  Perhaps you could meet him at the<br>
&gt; library.<br>
&gt; &gt; I could give you his phone # if you like  (or give<br>
&gt; him<br>
&gt; &gt; your phone # - that would be better).<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; Who was the woman you worked with?  It would be<br>
&gt; great<br>
&gt; &gt; for me to meet another direct descendent of<br>
&gt; William.<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; Amazing - the family is all back together after<br>
&gt; all<br>
&gt; &gt; these years!<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; I will start writing up all the info I have - it<br>
&gt; will<br>
&gt; &gt; be great to compile all the info we have as<br>
&gt; &gt; individuals.<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; I will be in Toronto in the spring - perhaps we<br>
&gt; could<br>
&gt; &gt; meet at the library!<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; I will email you Robert Stevens email contact<br>
&gt; later<br>
&gt; &gt; today - I have to search for it.<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; Have a great day!<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; Heather in Victoria B.C.<br>
