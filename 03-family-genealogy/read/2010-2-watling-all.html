	</p>
	<p align="center" style="widows: 2; orphans: 2">The
	first Jubal Watling encountered was  the author’s Great Great
	Grandfather.  There were three Watling ancestors named Jubal; the
	first, at least the first in my records was born in Brockdish,
	Norfolk, England about 1790 but, after marriage lived in Suffolk,
	England.  Jubal married Susannah (Susan) Leech and they had nine
	children:  Their children included: Emily, Mary Ann, Emily, William,
	Jubal, Susannah, John, John and George, several of whom die</p>
	<p style="widows: 2; orphans: 2">d
	young in England.  Jubal’s wife, Susanna, also died in England and
	was buried on May 5, 1829 in Syleham.  The family moved to Canada in
	1830, perhaps via Pictou, Nova Scoria but ended up in Prince Edward
	Island.  .  
	</p>
	<p style="orphans: 2; widows: 2"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="widows: 2; orphans: 2">On
	July 14, 1831, Jubal Watling and Louisa, a widow, were married in
	St. Paul Anglican Church, Charlottetown and the marriage record says
	that Jubal and his wife were &quot;lately&quot; in Norfolk County,
	England.  Jubal and Louisa also had at least one child, William
	Charles.  After Jubal died, Louisa married a William Smith.</p>
	<p style="orphans: 2; widows: 2"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="widows: 2; orphans: 2">Jubal’s
	sons, William and Jubal moved to the Miramichi in the mid 1800’s
	to work in shipbuilding; they both married MacNaughtons and owned
	land at the Meadows in Black River.

<p align="center" style="orphans: 2; widows: 2"><b>INTRODUCTION</b></p>
<p align="center" style="widows: 2; orphans: 2"><br />

</p>
<p align="center" style="widows: 2; orphans: 2"><br />

</p>
<p align="justify" style="orphans: 2; widows: 2">After
absorbing family information all my life and collecting it for over
60 years, I’ve decided to wrap it up and report my findings; the
task is not done but I am.  It is time to give the information to
others in return for the generosity shown to me.  It’s time to turn
to other interests.</p>
<p align="justify" style="orphans: 2; widows: 2"><br />

</p>
<p align="justify" style="orphans: 2; widows: 2">I
grew up in a home where family was important; this applied also to
the extended family on both my mother’s and father’s side. Then,
there was the Family Bible – kept in the polished side table (Was
it the gramophone stand?) in the parlour.  Available to view any time
but always handled with care and even reverence.  I also recall the
many times when mother remarked that someone, either in Black River
or from away, was related.  How could I have so many relatives?  Now
I know the answer.</p>
<p align="justify" style="orphans: 2; widows: 2"><br />

</p>
<p align="justify" style="orphans: 2; widows: 2">My
first formal foray into information gathering was a survey of my
father’s siblings and their offspring. I dabbled for many years
afterward but only after retirement, and mastering computer based
technology, did genealogy become a serious hobby – my family would
say obsession.  I close the initiative with most of the scraps of
paper having been discarded, my files in reasonable order and a
database of 6,000 names.</p>
<p align="justify" style="orphans: 2; widows: 2"><br />

</p>
<p align="justify" style="orphans: 2; widows: 2">I
carry genes from many families.  For this reason, I decided early on
that, although my name is Glendenning, I am equally a member on my
paternal side of many other families including, Rae, Harley, Bidders,
Peters and Sealey, The same applies to my maternal side where
families include Watling, MacNaughton, MacDonald, Jardine, MacAskill,
Jack  and Stewart.  Most of my data is about the Watlings and
Glendennings but, when other data came to my attention, I simply
entered it into my database.</p>
<p align="justify" style="orphans: 2; widows: 2"><br />

</p>
<p align="justify" style="orphans: 2; widows: 2">This
document does not pretend to be a history of the family; instead, it
is a record of what I learned during my search; a history would be
more thorough and complete.  If a lead interested me, I followed it. 
As a result the amount of data on each individual or family varies
greatly. Some readers, no doubt, will be disappointed in that the
book does not include the younger generations.  This was deliberate;
except for my siblings and their descendants, I have not included
many of generations later than mine; that information is more readily
available to those who seek it.</p>
<p align="justify" style="orphans: 2; widows: 2"><br />

</p>
<p align="justify" style="orphans: 2; widows: 2">I
believe the included information to be accurate but I am sure that
there are errors; if I knew what they were, I would have corrected
them.  When in doubt, I prefaced my remarks with “I think” or “it
is likely” or a similar statement; unfortunately, it is only with
recent information that I have been attributing sources.  One of my
weaknesses is in editing; therefore, the reader is likely to find
many typos - but hopefully few errors.  I welcome corrections and
additions. 
</p>
<p align="justify" style="orphans: 2; widows: 2"><br />

</p>
<p align="justify" style="orphans: 2; widows: 2"><br />

</p>
<p align="justify" style="orphans: 2; widows: 2"><br />

</p>
<p align="justify" style="orphans: 2; widows: 2"><br />

</p>
<p align="justify" style="orphans: 2; widows: 2">Among
other things, I’ve reviewed books, searched through newspapers,
undertaken Internet searches, gathered census data and reviewed
church and cemetery documents and visited cemeteries to see
inscriptions on markers and stones.   I’ve also spent hours
pestering family and friends and steering conversations to reveal
additional information.  
</p>
<p align="justify" style="orphans: 2; widows: 2"><br />

</p>
<p align="justify" style="orphans: 2; widows: 2">Some
of the information in this document has already been packaged and
distributed to siblings; these appear as an appendix; I’d be happy
to provide copies at cost to any one interested.  Other information
appeared in occasional newsletters, the <u>Family
Chronicle</u>, now
available, thanks to my son, Brian, and granddaughter, Lisa, on the
Glendenning Website <u><a href="http://www.glendenning.net/don"><span lang="en-US">www.glendenning.net/don</span></a></u>
 
</p>
<p align="justify" style="orphans: 2; widows: 2"><br />

</p>
<p align="justify" style="orphans: 2; widows: 2">Tracing
family is never complete; it will never be finished.  It is time,
however, to consolidate what I have learned and publish it for the
benefit of others. It is my hope that readers will find the document
of interest but, even more important, I hope that others will pick
the search and extend the knowledge of both the extended family and
the community.  Together we can continue to grow the record of our
mutual ancestors</p>
<p align="justify" style="orphans: 2; widows: 2"><br />

</p>
<p>I want to
thank all who contributed either knowingly or unknowingly to my
search. My Mother and the old family Bible were the first sources but
all my siblings contributed along the way.  Family historians, many
of whom are relatives, were most generous with time and information. 
Outside my regular family sources, special mention must be made of
Black River and its first Settlers by A W MacDougall (1935), and the
assistance of Donald Edge, Everard and Bertie MacLean, Barrie
Mackenzie Jack Wilson, Ernie MacLean, and Dick MacDougall.
Genealogists are generous with their time and information, and the
current technology facilitates both contact and the flow of
information; my internet circle includes descendants of most branches
of the family.  And the list goes on.  I am indebted to all
identified and to so many others.</p>
<p><br />

</p>
<p align="justify" style="orphans: 2; widows: 2">Finally,
I must point out that this document entailed a considerable
commitment of time that really should have been allotted to my wife
and family.  So, a special thanks to Carol but also to Brian and
Janet, Marie, Lisa and Laura.</p>

</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">Notes
for WATLING
FAMILY:</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0"><br />

</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">ORIGIN
OF NAME:  It is thought that the Watlings were Vikings who landed in
Northern Scotland in 870 AD, invaded northern France in 910 AD and
then came to England with William the Conqueror in 1066.  The name is
found in the Domesday Book which was a census taken in England in
1086. The first record of the name Watling was found in Sussex,
England somewhere between London and Dover.  It is likely that the
name arises from Wartling which was a hamlet in the area but others
believe that it was associated with Watling Road. By the time of
Richard 1, the Watling name had spread north to Watlingford in
Oxfordshire, Watlington in Norfolk, Essex and Hertfordshire.  Many
Norman families moved north to Scotland in the 12th century and this
might have included some Watlings.</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0"><br />

</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">The
Roger Watling Website includes the following comments about the
origin of the Watlings:</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0"><br />

</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">&quot;In
the 5th/6th century a band of people crossed the North Sea from
Europe to the British Isles, we do not know if it was one or more
boats, but as a yachtsman sailing these waters I would suppose the
latter, there being safety in numbers.  They knew where they were
going as trading was and had taken place long before, also they would
have had oral stories from their forebearers who might have served in
the Roman Legions, without a shred of evidence I like to think that
they were Angles, or possibly Jute in origin rather than Saxon.  The
leader of this band was WACEAL, and those with him of the same clan,
tribe or group were the Waceal - ingas.  Ingas was not the son of as
in the Scottish Watson, but meaning people of or followers of Waceal,
so members of this group would be referred to as Wacelaingas.  As
time past the name began to change from, the vowels hardening, or
softening, plus the input of people from other tongues and one form
was Waselin.  The earliest records I have are for Norfolk 1086, the
DOOM'D DAY BOOK.  In this book is recorded the Manor in the Half
Hudred Diss, today scholars call it a lost Manor as its whereabouts
are unknown.  (I have my own theory, but that is another story)  The
Manor of Watlingeseta it states was held by the king (William in
1086, and before 1066 Edward the Confessor).  Also recorded in the
book is Wazalin who held land in Weeting, Norfolk, one of the few
Anglo Saxons still holding land after William the Bastard and his
bunch of land grabbing thugs won the Battle of Hastings.  Watling
Street was built by the Romans during their occupation and the name
came after the Roman period, the present day town of St. Albans was
originally Watlingcaster, but after the martyrdom of St. Alban the
name changed, it can be supposed that the Wacealingas lived there.”</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0"><br />

</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">WATLING
STREET:  Watling Street was a major Road built by the Romans after
they invaded Britain in 55 BC.  It started at Reculver, near Dover,
passing through Canterbury (where a street sign bears the name) and
on to London and points north.  From London, Watling Road runs north
and west passing through St. Albans  (ancient Verulamium) a distance
of about 200 km.  An Internet source says that Watling Road ran from
Dover to North Wales.</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0"><br />

</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">WATLING
EMIGRATION:  From my reading, I learn, but certainly cannot prove,
that kinsmen of the family Watling who came to North America include:
Frances Watling who settled in Virginia in 1660, John Watling who
landed in America in 1753, Mary Watlington settled in Antigua in
1759, James Watling settled in Philadelphia in 1842,   Some Watlings
are said to have moved to Canada after the American Revolution.  A
book, The Fatal Shore, by Robert Hughes, about the history of
Australia mentions  Thomas Watling, from Dumfries, Scotland, who was
transported to Australiain 1792 for forging notes on the Bank of
Scotland; Watling became a landscape painter and apparently, his art
is well known in Australia today.  When I travel, I often check local
phone books for family names; Watling must be one of the rarest.</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0"><br />

</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">PIOUS
PIRATE:  Watling Castle sits on Sandy Point in San Salvador Island
which is part of the Bahamas.  The Island was originally named
Watling's Island in honour of Captain George Watling, a famous
buccaneer and pirate.  (It was renamed in 1926).  Watling was also
known as the pious pirate because he would not allow his crew to play
cards or indulge in piracy on the Sabbath.  The name Watling appears
frequently in literature about the Bahamas.  There may have also been
a pirate named John Watling.  I am sure that neither of these were
part of our family. (&lt;http://www.bahamasnet.com/sansalvador.html&gt;)</p>

WATLINGS:  My search led me to Suffolk, England, where the name of
Jubal, Susan (Susannna?) and  their family appear in the records of
Sylleham; Jubal's actual birthplace, however, was Brockdish, Norfolk.
 Suffolk County was described in 1812 as follows:</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0"><br />

</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">&quot;Suffolk,
an English COUNTY 
</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">&lt;http://www.genuki.org.uk/big/eng/SFK/map.html&gt;
47 miles in length and 30 miles in breadth, bounded on the West by
Cambridgeshire, on the North by Norfolk, on the South by Essex and on
the East by the German Ocean. It contains 575 parishes, 28 market
towns and sends 16 members to Parliament. The air is generally
wholesome, but the soil is various, on the sea coast it is sandy and
there are several small hills which yield hemp, pease and rye. The
inland parts are clayey and more full of trees. The borders towards
Essex are fit for pastures and the NW produces corn of all sorts.
There are manufactures of several kinds, particularly all sorts of
broad-cloth, stuffs and coarse linen. The principal rivers are Little
Ouse, the Waveney, the Stour, The Breton, the Orwell or Gippe, the
Ore and the Blyth. Ipswich and St.Edmundsberry are the principal
towns&quot;.</p>

</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">&quot;Jubal
Watling singleman of Brockdish, Norfolk and Susan Leech, singlewoman,
of this parish by banns, 10th November, 1814.  Jubal signed (good

<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0"><br />

</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">A
recent examination (2008) of the census of PEI 1841, found a Jubal
Watling, living in Lot 52, PEI; Lot 52 is in eastern PEI close to
Montague and Georgetown; there were 6 people in the household, four
of whom were born in England and two in PEI; of the six in the
household, four males were under age sixteen, one female between 16
and 45 and one male between 45 and 60; the census records also show
that Jubal was a mason and that one of the six had paid his or her
passage; that fits Jubal and the family since we know that Mary Anne
Watling, daughter of Jubal and Susanna, married William Maxwell on
July 24, 1834 in St Paul's Anglican Church in Charlottetown and would
have, presumably, been living outside the home.  The family may or
may not have been Church of England, however,I am told that the
Church of England was usually willing to marry couples whether or not
they were church members.</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0"> 
</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">After
Susannah died in England in 1829, Jubal and the family came to Canada
in 1830; in 1831, Jubal married Louisa and continued to live on PEI;
his children by his Susanah  moved to the Miramichi area of New
Brunswick seeking employment in the shipbuilding industry.  Jubal and
Louisa had at least one child, Charles; Jubal died, presumably, in
the early 1840's and is likely buried in PEI; Louisa remarried
William Smith in 1848.

<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">An

Watling may be the son of Samuel Harper Watling &amp; Susanna.

<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0"><br />

</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">On
July 14, 1831, a Jubal and Louisa Watling married in St. Paul
Anglican Church, Charlottetown and the marriage record says that
Jubal and his wife were &quot;lately&quot; in Norfolk County,
England;  I also found a marriage of Louisa Watling, widow, and
William Smith, widower, by a Justice of the Peace on March 17, 1848;
in this scenario, Jubal would have died some time between 1841 and
1848 and, presumably is buried in PEI. PEI records show the likely
cemeteries for Lot 52 to be either the Lorne Valley Presbyterian or
the Montague Community cemeteries, however, a search of tombstone
inscriptions did not reveal any Watlings.</p>

<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">Thanks
to Caryl Savard, a direct descendant of William and Louisa (Watling)
Smith, I learned that William and Louisa had at least two children,
Margaret born April 24, 1848 and Mary Ann born Auugust 15, 1851. 
Both were baptized on May 10, 1853.  Furthermore, Caryl has photos of

<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">Notes
for JUBAL
WATLING:</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">The
1851 census says that Jubal came to Canada in 1830, that he was
married to Christina MacNaughton and that he and Christina, together
with children Jubal, Alexander and Susan, were living with Jannet
MacNaughton (Jubal' mother-in-law);  also in 1851, Jubal Watling  
(F4243) petitioned for 50 acres of land on the South side of Black
River adjoining south of William McBeath's meadow lot and east of a
lot applied for by John Edge.  The petition is dated at Chatham on
April 9, 1851 and includes his signature.  The property was vacant,
surveyed but without improvements.  Other handwritten notes on the
page are confusing in that they show apparent approval on May 21/1851
and Auction, August/51&quot;.  They are signed by Peters, the Deputy
Surveyor.  No lot number is given but records show that a William
MacBeath owned property in the area.

<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">Notes
for JUBAL
WATLING:</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">Jubal
Watling was granted 50 acres of land in the Meadows in 1884. In Aunt
Janet Godfrey's tapes she said that her grandfather, Jubal , had a
log house; she also said the her mother, Grace, did not want to move
to Little Branch; 
</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0"><br />

</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">As
a younger man, he is believed to have worked for Senator Snowball. 
The family decided in 1901 to move to Little Branch.  I suspect that
they moved for a number of reasons.  Jubal's mother and father had
both recently died, Grace's father had just died, her mother was not
well, her brother, Jim, could not handle the farm, and the children
would be much closer to school.  Aunt Tine and Aunt Elspie were
married; the younger children would still be in school.</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0"><br />

</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">On
November 13, 1901, James entered into an agreement with his sister,
Grace and her husband, Jubal.  As parties to the agreement also were
Jubal and Grace's four sons, George, John, James and Ernest.  A copy
of this agreement can be found in the Northumberland County
Registrar's office.  This transfer did not include the Jessie
MacDonald property which Elmer Glendenning later bought.</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0"><br />

</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">All
the land and buildings were turned over to the Watlings.  In return,
the Watlings agreed to  &quot;keep support, maintain and provide the
said James J. McDonald and his mother, Mrs. John D. McDonald, each of
them and the survivor of them during the respective terms of their
natural lives with good and sufficient house, room, meat, drink,
washing, clothing, bedding, fire, light, medicine, medical
attendance, personal expenses and all such necessaries as persons of
their ages and conditions in life usually require and are accustomed
to.&quot;  The Watlings were also to provide a &quot;decent Christian
burial&quot; paying all funeral expenses.</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0"><br />

</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">Post
Office records show Jubal Watling as the Postmaster at Little Branch
from December 1, 1903 to December 2, 1910.  Aunt Tine's name is not
shown as Postmistress, although I believe that she kept the post
office.  If this is true, it is likely that she ran the Post Office
for her father between 1902, when Tom Adams died and 1907, when she
married John Mackenzie.

<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">Notes
for CHRISTINA
CATHERINE
WATLING:</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">Aunt
Tine was the oldest of the family.  She married Tom Adams but he died
in 1902 at age 30.  Aunt Tine was then 26.  Tom Adams was thought to
have died of some rare disease and was living with his in-laws, Grace
and Jubal Watling, at the time.</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0"><br />

</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">Post
Office records show Jubal Watling as the Postmaster at Little Branch
from December 1, 1903 to December 2, 1910.  Aunt Tine's name is not
shown as Postmistress, although we believe that she lived in the
Jessie MacDonald home (where Norman Glendenning now lives) and kept
the post office.  If this is true, it is likely that she ran the Post
Office for her father between 1902, when Tom Adams died and 1907 when
she married John Mackenzie.  John MacKenzie moved to the Miramichi
from Cape Breton to work in the ship building industry</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0"><br />

</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">After
her marriage to John MacKenzie, they moved to the W. S. Loggie home
and farm just east of Loggieville.  John MacKenzie is thought to have
died about 1924.  Sometime after that, Aunt Tine moved next to the
church in Loggieville.  Later she sold her home and moved to Mount
St. Joseph's where she was living when she died in 1956.  John
MacKenzie is believed to have come to the Miramichi to work in ship
building and, Edith told me, he was related to the MacKenzies who
lived up the Branch at the MacKenzie Settlement.</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0"><br />

</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">Jean
MacKenzie, was severely disabled with rheumatoid  arthritis for many
years and lived with her mother in Loggieville.  When Aunt Tine was
no longer able to look after her, Jean moved to Chippewa, Ontario
with her half-brother, Willard, and later to a nursing home.</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0"><br />

</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">Hartley,
the son of James Adams and Ella Watling, was adopted by Gertrude
Chase but was really raised by Aunt Tine.  Hartley served in WW2 and
later moved, first to England and later to Australia where he died
sometime in the 1990's.</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0"><br />

<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">I

</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">The
death of Mrs. Christina MacKenzie, wife of the late John MacKenzie, a
well-known resident of Loggieville, occurred at Mount St. Joseph's
Pavilion here at an early hour Friday morning.</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0"><br />

</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">The
late Mrs MacKenzie was the former Christina Watling of Black River
and was eighty years of age.  She was twice married, her first
husband being Thomas Adams of Black River.</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0"><br />

</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">Surviving
from her first marriage are two sons, James Adams and Willard Adams
both of Chippewa, Ontario.</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">Surviving
from her second marriage are two daughters, Mrs. F. Schickle,
Mandarin, Florida and Miss Jean MacKenzie, Chippewa, Ontario.  Two
	sisters and three brothers also survive.  They are Mrs. John R.
Godfrey, Black River Bridge, and Mrs Elmer Glendenning, Black River;
James A Watling, 	Black River, George A. Watling, New Hampshire, and
D. Ernest Watling, Loggieville.

funeral was held on Sunday afternoon from the home of Ernest Watling,

service 	at Knox United Church.  Interment was made in the Pine Grove
Cemetery.</p>

<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">Aunt
Janet's tapes say the Aunt Tine and John Mackenzie lived for a while
in Cape Breton but moved back and bought a place in Loggieville,
(near the end of the McKnight road); Joan Mackenzie wrote: John
MacKenzie used to say, &quot; I had 3, she had 3 and we had 3'. He
was referring to the children they had; Marjorie Young also thinks
that they moved to Cape Breton to work, then returned to Loggieville
to work in Loggie's mill;  Barry MacKenzie says &quot;Some in our
family recall that there was some connection between our MacKenzies
and John K. MacKenzie, and given that our ancestors originally
settled at Pictou, this could quite possibly be the case.&quot;</p>

</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">Notes
for JUBAL
GEORGE
WATLING:</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">In
1908 was working in Portland; believe that he worked for Elmer
Glendenning while in Portland and likely in the New Hampshire woods;
Edith MacKenzie thought that Uncle George also worked in the South
with Elmer Glendenning; in later life he worked in maintenance at
Dartmouth College (?), in New Hampshire.</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0"><br />

</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">His
son, Elbridge, told me that Uncle George worked in construction work
in Augusta, Georgia and during WW1, worked at Langley Field (that
would likely be when Dad was there).  Although he was making good
money, he left Virginia by boat for New York and then by train to New
Brunswick.  (Apparently, they removed his trunk from the train at the
NB border)  He stayed for 13 weeks with his brother, Jim.  Uncle Jim
gave him a horse so he could visit around with his relatives.  Papers
provided by Tina Newton state that he returned to Canada in 1919 for
four months.</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0"><br />

</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">He
worked for a couple of years on a dam on the Connecticut river at 15
Mile Falls on the Vermont/New Hampshire border (Wilder Dam? near
Hanover, NH).  The face of the dam was 103 feet high, one of the
highest ever at the time.  As I recall, Elbridge went to school
there.</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0"><br />

</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">Granddaughter,
Christina. says he was married in USA, probably in Hampton, Va. 
because his wife's family had moved there from Redbank, NB.  She also
said that he was working on the Tennessee Valley Dam Project at the
time his son, Elbridge, was born.  Technically, the Tennessee Valley
Authority was not formed until much later, however, the dams on the
Ocoee River (where Dad worked) became part of the TVA.  The Ocoee
River originates in or near Georgia.  It is likely that  possible,
for example, that Aunt Emma went to Augusta when her son was born and
Mum came to New Brunswick.  Uncle George also worked at Langley Field
in Virginia.</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0"><br />

</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">Uncle
George did not return to Black River for 31 years, and then came
every year, sometimes with his grand children.  Later he moved to a
lodge operated by the Order of the Moose near Jacksonville, Florida,
and died there of pneumonia.</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0"><br />

</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">When
his sister Jane went to Portland in 1908, I believe she stayed for a
while with her brother George.  I recall her telling that she arrived
early in the morning and Uncle George was 	supposed to meet her.  He
did not show.  Later she learned that he had come to the station but
did not recognize her.  She had grown since he had left Black River. 

</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0"><br />

</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">His
granddaughter, Tina Watling Newton sent copies of papers including:</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0"><br />

</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">	An
Application for a Certificate of Arrival: dated April 16, 1931 at 13
Cheney Street, Newport, New Hampshire, stating that he had entered
the United States at Vanceboro, Mine in September, 	1903; he had
	bought his ticket at Chatham, travelled to Saint John, the
immigration officer came aboard at Saint John and processed
passengers; He was heading for Bangor, 		Maine and was joining 	&quot;no
one' in the USA.  His application gave his occupation as labour
foremen and construction work.  Alfred H. MacLean,of Little Branch
was travelling with 	him.</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">	Another
paper shows him being discharged from the National Guard of the State
of Maine in May 1908.  It was an honorable discharge and his CO said
that he would be glad to have him back.  He had only enlisted on
March 21, 1908 but apparently had moved out of state.</p>

<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">Ken
thinks that Uncle Jim was not well one winter and moved up with Dad
in the woods of New Hampshire where he was a &quot;cookee&quot;.  His
father died in 1915 and he returned from Portland to look after his
mother; he had worked in either a chemists shop or a photo shop.  May
have been engaged while in Portland.  One story has it that Uncle Jim
gave a &quot;diamond&quot; to a girl in Portland prior to his
returning home.  Uncle Jim was in the militia anw went to camp in
Sussex.</p>

for JANE
ELIZABETH
JARDINE
WATLING:</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">Jane
was the second youngest of a family of eight born to Jubal Watling
and Grace (MacAskill) MacDonald, born, presumably at home, at the
Meadows, Upper Black River, New Brunswick.  She was named after Jane
Elizabeth Jardine , daughter of John Jardine, (1836-1912)who married
Donald Cameron (Cameron Russell's grandmother)</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0"><br />

</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">When
she was about 10 years old, the family moved from the Meadows to
Little Branch.  She attended the Upper Black River school and later
the school at Little Branch. 
</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0"><br />

</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">Jane
arrived in Portland on January 24, 1908 just prior to her 18th
birthday.   Jane arrived in the early morning of January 24, 1908 and
waited for her brother, George, to meet her. Apparently he came to
the station but did not recognize her.   She had grown up while he
was away from Black River.  Her brother Jack also worked in Portland
at that time and likely there were many cousins. We also know that
her brother Jim worked in Portland in a chemist/pharmacy, and also in
photography, but whether he was there at that time we do not know.

</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">Among
Mum's possessions was an envelope, addressed in Dad's handwriting and
mailed from Wisconsin, showing Mum's address as 130 Emery Street,
Portland.</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0"><br />

</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">She
married Elmer Glendenning on October 18, 1910 and returned to the US
where they lived and worked for the next nine years; .Information
about this period is found in the notes about Elmer.</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0"><br />

</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">In
Black river, Jane was active in her church, the Women's Missionary
society and the Women's league.  She was also a long time member of
the women's institute.  She liked to read and, in the early years at
least, wrote poetry.</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0"><br />

</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">After
28 years of marriage, Jane Elizabeth Jardine (Watling) became a widow
in 1939; she was 48 at the time.  The two oldest daughters, Grace and
Venetia, were married and living elsewhere; her daughter, Lillian,
was living and working in the Boston area.  Elinor and the five boys,
the youngest being nine years old, were living at home.</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0"><br />

</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">The
next decade, the wartime years, brought a number of significant
changes to the community.  The commencement of classes, and the
construction of the Miramichi Rural High School, allowed young people
of the community to continue their schooling to the end of high
school while continuing to live at home; before this, the nearest
high school was in Loggieville, eleven miles away.  The looming war
resulted in the construction of an airbase at Chatham, a radar
station at St. Margaret's, and a bombing range on the road to
Loggieville.  These developments meant a significant growth of
non-farm jobs for the community.  The outbreak of hostilities also
soon resulted in sons, sons-in-law, neighbours, relatives and friends
entering the armed forces.  The decade also brought improved roads,
regular bus service to Chatham and electric lights.  By the end of
the decade, Black River had moved from a barter to a cash economy.</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0"><br />

</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">Although
the sons continued to operate the family farm for the next decade,
the decade also brought significant changes to the family;  Walter
finished building his house on the Dan MacLean property, married and
moved out; Lillian returned to New Brunswick and married; Elinor,
Kenneth, Norman and Don attended the new Miramichi High School;
Walter, Kenneth and Norman served in the armed forces; John, after
operating the farm during the war, married, built a house and moved
to the Bob MacLean property; Elinor married and moved out; Kenneth
returned from military service, married and moved away; Don finished
high school and entered teaching; Norman married and settled on the
home place.    
</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0"><br />

</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">Jane
continued to be active in the community generally and encouraged her
family and others to do the same.  She was especially active in her
church, the Women's Missionary Society, the Presbyterian League and
the Women's Institute.  She believed in education and supported the
construction of a high school for the area; she also encouraged her
family and others to continue their schooling. (It is interesting to
note that the Miramichi Rural High School was the first rural high
school in the Province; immediately following WW2, the number grew
rapidly with, I believe, federal financial support, until there were
approximately 50 rural high schools throughout the New Brunswick.)

pancreas having been in the hospital only about two weeks.

</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">The
following vignettes are intended to round out the picture of Mother,
her interests, activities and passions:</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0"><br />

</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">1	While
discussing VE Day with Vance MacNaughton in June of 1995 at the
shopping mall in Douglastown, he told Ken and I about his memory of
VE Day (May 8, 1944).  As readers will know, the Little Branch School
was down the road and across the brook from home.  Vance was a
student in the school at the time when, suddenly, there was a knock
and, without waiting for a response, the door flew open the school
door flew open and Mum announced to teacher and students alike &quot;The
War is over&quot;.  
</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">2	Mother
had no formal training as a nurse but made herself available and was
frequently called upon by others in the community in time of need
such as for a birth or death in a family.  
</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">3	Her
&quot; pin money&quot; came from trading wool for yarn.  The wool was
wash in rainwater heated on the kitchen stove, carried to the front
yard, washed and rinsed several times and spread on the grass to dry
then gathered up and bagged.  down into the grass and, therefore,
being difficult to gather and bag when dry. The bags wool were loaded
into the Model A Ford and taken to Brown's Woolen Mills in Nelson
where it would be made into yarn.  She bartered her wool for skeins
of yarn in colours, but mostly in white or grey. She knitted mitts
and socks for the family, and sometimes for Christmas gifts, and sold
surplus yarn to neighbours and, I think, she had some customers by
mail.</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0"><br />

</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">4	Bread
was a staple and a large family required many loaves of bread each
week.  The recipe was mixed in a large, round blue-enamelled, bread
pan.  A cake of Fleischmann's yeast was &quot;started&quot; in a cup
of warm water.  The dough was made into loaves, set in a warm place
to rise, and then put in the oven to bake.  My recollection is that
she would make 7 loaves at a time twice a week.  
</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0"><br />

</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">5	Mother
loved to have visitors.  There were a half-dozen at every meal and
putting up a meal for 15 after church on Sunday, or any other day,
did not faze her a bit or if it did, she did not let on.  I cannot
ever even once remember her saying, I wish they hadn't or wouldn't
come today.  Meals were not fancy but they were always tasty.  Of
course, when the visitors were family, the daughters or
daughters-in-law, pitched in to help.</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0"><br />

</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">6	Oil
lamps were tended early each day so that, when night fell, there was
no scramble for a light.  We had three oil lamps plus, in later
years, an Aladdin lamp.  Lamps were filled with kerosene, wicks were
trimmed, globes were wiped first with an old newspaper to remove the
soot, then washed, dried and replaced.  When finished, the kerosene
lights were placed on a shelf beside the clock high on the kitchen
wall.   The Aladdin lamp used gas, naphtha?, and did not require such
daily care. 
</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0"><br />

</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">7	Securing
food for the coming winter was a major concern in a household.  While
Mother had no special role in the planting or harvesting, she played
the major role in pressuring food for winter.  The first step was to
have a good garden, which resulted in potatoes, carrots and turnips
stored in bins in the basement.  Carrots were a bit more complex and
were usually stored in sand in the basement.  Apples were stored in a
cold bedroom, usually the large bedroom over the driveway.  Some
preserves were put up - peaches, cucumber pickles, chow and mustard
beans.  Several baskets of peaches were purchased and these were
bottled along with some strawberries, blueberries and maybe even
raspberries.

for ELMER
ALTON
GLENDENNING:</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">Elmer,
the second child and first son to Walter and Elizabeth (Peters)
Glendenning, was born in Canobie on land that is now a grove of trees
directly across the road from the Canobie School, now the Women's
Institute Hall.   Baptismal record shows birthdate as June 10, 1875</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0"><br />

</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">It
is likely that he went to the one room school on a corner of his
Uncle's farm next door since the family seems to have valued
education; this is not surprising in that his grandmother was a
teacher and lived in the home until Elmer was 20.  As further
evidence, his brother, Chip took a business course, Guy studied but
did not finish dentistry and Margaret trained as a nurse.  It is
likely that Dad took some technical courses while in Portland; I
remember some engineering books at home.  His oldest sister, Venetia,
provided a home for his sister, Margaret, so that she could finish
high school in Portland; I believe that Uncle Guy also completed high

</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">Elmer's
father was a farmer and, judging by the amount of land accumulated, a
successful one at that.  Elmer, and all the boys, and maybe even the
girls, would be expected to do their share.  The land would have to
be cleared of trees, and those who know Canobie, will remember the
stony fields; and all the work would be done by hand or with the aid
of horses.</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0"><br />

</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">At
that time he probably knew people, even friends, who went to Maine or
New Hampshire during the winter to work in the woods and then return
to farm and fish in the summer; he may have even done that himself.  
</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0"><br />

</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">The
Glendennings were well established in Portland in the first decade of
the 1900s. Frank moved there in 1898 and Elmer by 1901. Venetia, the
oldest child, seems to have played the role of &quot;host&quot; as
each new family member moved south.  Venetia lived in Falmouth
Foreside which is between Portland and Freeport.  Other siblings
known to have lived in Portland, at least for a while, include
Margaret, Raymond and Guy.   In addition, Maude and her husband, Jim
Cormier lived in Lincoln, New Hampshire where Uncle Jim Cormier
worked in the mill, and Leonard and his family lived in Maine.  We
also know, for example, that his Aunt, Mary Ann (Harley) who had
married a Stevens and lived next door in Canobie, had moved to
Portland to be with family after her husband died in 1870.   Land
grant records show that Lot # 28 in Canobie, 100 acres, was granted
to Atton E. Glendenning on 1901-07-06.  .</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0"><br />

</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">Prior
to his marriage in 1910, we know that Elmer, his brother, Frank, and
likely brothers Ray and Guy operated a trucking business under the
name Glendenning Bros. &amp; Co. (All Kinds of Team Work) at 24
Hammond Street. They had horses and wagons and did all kinds of
hauling.  Portland was the winter terminus of the Great Northern
Railway, later the CNR, which meant that much goods would be moved,
in all kinds of combinations, from trains, ships to warehouses,
retail stores and homes.  One role Dad told about was that of
delivering ice to homes. Elmer also had crews of men and horses in
the woods in  winter, we believe in both Maine and new Hampshire, but
possibly also in Vermont.  Other people from Black River worked with
him including his brother-in-law, James A. Watling  and Ramsay
MacLean (a nephew of Adam MacLean who was married to Elmer's first
cousin. Millie.)  According to Herbert Daley, Herb Daley, Dad's first
cousin, also worked in the woods with Elmer.  
</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0"><br />

</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">In
the first decade of the 20th century, Elmer and his brothers operated
a cartage business in Portland, Maine.  I believe that his brother,
Frank, was a partner in the business and others may have been as
well.  Bobby Glendenning believes said that his father, Guy, worked
in the business and brother Ray worked with them as a blacksmith.  By
1910, Elmer was working on the Rothschild dam in Wausau, Wisconsin
from where, on January 25, 1910, he mailed &quot;Jeannie Glendenning&quot;
in Portland; some dams were being built to improve the rafting of
logs; others were built for the generation of power.  
</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0"><br />

</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">Elmer
and Jane were married in Litle Branch in 1910 and returned to
Portland, however, by February 1911 they were living in Parksville,
Tennessee where Elmer worked on Ocoee #1, the first of three dams
build on the Ocoee River. Later Mum and Dad moved up the Ocoee River
to Caney Creek where a second dam was built.  (This project included
the construction of a flume line to carry water for five  miles over
valleys and along rocky ledges to a head pond with a drop of 250 feet
to the turbines below.)  The flume line is still in existence and
designated as a national historic site.  Over the next few years they
moved from construction site to construction site in Hampton,
Virginia, Mussel Shoals. Alabama, North haven, Connecticut,   Dad
also worked for a while in Abiline, Texas but I do not believe that
Mum moved there.   Probably the other major project was in Virginia
where Elmer was in charge of the clearing of Langley Field which, I
believe, handled both sea and land based airplanes.  It was a defense
establishment and, I believe they lived on th site; people needed
passes when returning to the site; Venetia's pass was for 1918, I do
not know the year of Lillian's pass.  Dad worked in Mussell Shoals
likely either at the Wilson Dam or at the nearby nitrate plant.  At
the same time, we have evidence that Uncle Frank worked at Plant No.
1, US Nitrate Co. in Sheffield Alabama.  He was working  for the J.
G. White Engineering Co, which is the same one Dad worked for in
Hampton, Virginia.</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0"><br />

</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">On
July 21, 1914, Elmer bought the Jessie MacDonald property at Little
Branch  and they move there during late 1913 or early 1914  (The
property passed from Jessie to her nephew, Alexader from whom Dad
made the purchase)   Elmer beame post master in 1914 but resigned in
1916 and moved to Fairhaven, Connecticut where they lived at 3
Perkins Street.  By 1919, they took up permanent residence at their
home in Little Branch.  Over the years he purchased a number of other
properties, one for each of his sons.</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0"><br />

</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">Like
others in Black River, they operated a mixed farm that included cows,
pigs, hens, geese, horses, turkeys; crops included a farm garden,
oats, barley, wheat, buckwheat, and hay.  Cash was scarce; most of
their business was accomplished thriugh barter of eggs, chickens,,
beef, pork, the sale of weaners (Piglets four to six weeks old),
geese, turkeys, ducks, bales of hay, bags of grain, cream, potatoes,
furnace wood, and butter, etc.  In addition, the  farm ensured that
the family had meat and potatoes for their own use.  For a while he
had a team of oxen which he used around the farm.  Lillian remembers
using them to haul sap from back on the &quot;ridge&quot;.</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0"><br />

</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">Elmer
active in the community including the building of St. Paul's
Presbyterian Church (on June 14, 1926 was elected to the first Board
of Managers) , was a prime mover in the construction of a community
hall.  The first hall was opened in 1931 and burned to the ground in
1932.  A second hall was built in 1933.  He was active in the Orange
Lodge, Oddfellows, and Masons.</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0"><br />

</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">In
addition to farming, he and his brother-in-law, John W. MacNaughton
operated a pulp business. They operated a &quot;rosser&quot;, a
machine for peeling pulp in Middle Black River, across from the
Cameron School, and operated lumber camps in St. Margaret's and the
Black River area.  He continued to be active in construction and
built the bridge at John Godfrey's and John Dick's. His last job away
from home was the construction of Tinker Dam near Woodstock, NB</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0"><br />

</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">Elmer
Glendenning was known as a hard worker. He built and repaired his own
harness, re-soled the children's shoes, and made axe handles. Even
when he was not able to work, Brydone Weeks told that Dad had himself
taken to the field in a wheelbarrow where he sharpened the scythes
while the men were cutting marsh hay.  Dad suffered for a number of
years with pernicious anaemia (or was it leukemia ?).  Walter
remembers the wagon rack breaking one evening when coming from the
woods with a load of wood.  Later he and Dad returned to the woods,
unloaded the wood, cut poles, repaired the wagon rack, and returned
home so that the wagon load of wood was ready to be taken to
Loggieville the next day.  Part of the repair work was carried out by
the light of a lantern.  Lillian remembers Dad up on the roof
shingling at daybreak.  
</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0"><br />

</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">Dad
was a founding member of an Agricultural Society (#103) and was its
Secretary Treasurer for fourteen years.  An Agricultural Society, and
there were many throughout the Province,  was like a Co-op.  Farmers
banded together and bought seeds, lime and fertilizer, etc. in bulk
and sold it to themselves</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0"><br />

</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">It
is interesting that Dad's name sometimes appears as Alton Elmer and
other times as Elmer Alton Glendenning.  Although I have not seen a
birth certificate, my earliest references are to Elmer Alton
Glendenning.

WATLING:</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">John
met Mary when she attended a service at St. Paul's with her cousin,
Millie MacDonald.  He took Mary back to Point Aux Carr that night. 
John and Mary were married at the Branch on January 27, 1944 and
lived at the Branch for a while.  The day of, or day before, the
wedding, John went in town to do some last minute shopping.  It was
raining and the roads were icy.  An RCMP vehicle went through a stop
sign and clipped John's truck.

<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">Mary
grew up and went to school in Point Aux Carr, she also attended
Sunday school which was held in the school.  As part of a large

the barn as well as the house.</p>

<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">Mary
was a true partner with john in running their country store; John
opened the store about 6:00 am while Mary got breakfast; john went in
for breakfast about 8 and Mary took over in the store.  It was a
full-time job for both of them.</p>

</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">Notes
for JOHN
FRANKLIN
GLENDENNING:</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">John
was born at Little Branch shortly after the family returned to
Canada.  He attended the Little Branch School probably for 7 or 8
years, and then he worked on the farm.  Dad had not been well for a
number of years so Walter and John did the farm work.   
</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0"><br />

</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">John
and Walter hauled fish from Hardwicke to Chatham, cut hardwood on the
&quot;ridge&quot; and delivered it to Loggieville and Chatham.  One
day they would go to Hardwicke or Baie St. Anne (including Fred
Savoie's) and bring fish back to the Branch; the next day, they
delivered the fish to Chatham for $5.00 per ton (two box-sled loads).
 They went to the woods and cut and split a cord of hardwood and the
next day delivered it to Loggieville or Chatham for $5.00 including
the cost of the wood.   
</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0"><br />

</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">John
worked hard and put in long hours.  He expected others to do their
bit whether it was bringing in the wood for the stove, doing barn
chores, going to the woods in winter, making hay in summer, etc.  It
was expected and you did it.  But he was also very generous to people
needing help.    
</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0"><br />

</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">In
the late 1930's John, along with some other young men from Black
River including Tom Harper, Theodore Fowlie, took an agricultural
course in Newcastle.  The course included practical farm mechanics,
agriculture, book keeping, general mechanics and woodworking.  As
part of the course, John made a beautiful birch desk, which he
finished in walnut.  I also remember that he learned a new technique
for killing chickens.  I believe that it was then or shortly
thereafter, that John rigged up a wind generator on the roof of the
barn which would charge a battery and provide light.</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0"><br />

</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">One
winter, November I believe, he and Brydone Weeks (Brydone was home on
leave, probably before he went overseas) built a tractor out of an
Oakland front end (a car that belonged to Alex MacDonald) and a
Godferson rear end (a truck used by the A&amp;R Loggie Co) - and they
did this in Walter's old shed without the aid of welding and cutting
equipment (or heat). The tractor had two transmissions.  The tractor
was very powerful but the too heavy for soft ground.</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0"><br />

</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">During
the winter of 1945-46, and perhaps winters previous to this, John,
Ken and Norm all worked in the woods for Hubert Matchett of Sunny
Corner.  They would be gone all week and I did the barn work.</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0"><br />

</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">As
a young lad going on 17, I went to work on the boats in Chatham
loading pulp and pit props.  (I am sure that I got my first job based
on the reputation of John, Ken and Norm.)  One day we were storing
8-foot props down in the hold.  They are heavy enough anyway but
these were also moldy; I was struggling and John knew it.  John said,
&quot;Let me take that one, Donald&quot;.  And it happened many
times.  
</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0"><br />

</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">For
a number of years John went from farm to farm along the Miramichi
pressing hay, first with a horse powered hay press but later with a
press operated off a tractor.  (When pressing hay at home, it was my
job to keep the horse moving and to prevent it from grabbing at the
hay when it went past the end of the bundle.)  Bundles of hay weighed
between 80 to 120 pounds.  John worked all around Black River, Napan,
Barnaby River, Cains River, etc.  For a number of years, John owned a
3-ton Dodge truck, which I believe he bought from Hubert Matchett,
and trucked pulp, pit props, gravel, lime, fertilizer, hay and
Christmas trees.</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0"><br />

</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0"><br />

</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">In
1946-47 John and Mary built a new house on the Bob MacLean property
and in the spring of 1948 opened a store in their living room.  In
1968 they built a new store nearer the road and put in gas tanks. 
John was very entrepreneurial selling groceries, flour, feed,
plumbing, furnaces and anything else to make a buck.</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0"><br />

</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">John
received his call for military service and, I believe, went to
Fredericton for a physical.  He had very poor eyesight and was turned
down.  He probably would not have had to serve anyway, because
farming was an essential service and he was needed at home.  Ken and
Norm were already in the Service and I was too young to take over the
responsibility of farming.  
</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0"><br />

</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">When
Ken and Norm were in the service, I was the only one around to help
with the farm work.  Since Dad died when I was very young, you might
say that I learned to work under John's direction.  I recall going to
the woods in the winter, sitting on the bob-sled and on the load of
wood on the way home, building loads of loose hay and poisoning
potato bugs early in the morning to take advantage of heavy dew. 
John was the only one of the boys who would sing while driving to and
from the fields or woods - I especially remember him singing familiar
hymns.</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0"><br />

</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">Many
of the older people in Black River will remember the 1939 Ford
half-ton truck that, as I recall, John purchased from Bonnie
Flanagan.  It was a far cry from the old Model A.  The truck had
wooden cab on the back and John would take people to town on Saturday
night when the stores were open.  There could be a 10-12 people in
the back.  I think that he charged one dollar.  The last thing before
leaving town, he would drive up Water Street and past Ben's Canteen
to see if anyone needed a lift home.  
</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0"><br />

</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">John
and Mary liked to visit family and friends around the Miramichi and
Bathurst.  John and Mary, with Margaret and Jeannie, made their first
trip to Florida over Christmas of 1958.  Carol and I went with them
to help with the driving.  Later, they managed to visit Florida for a
month most winters always stopping to see family and friend in
Florida and on the way.  When our children were small and we visited
Black River, John always had gave the kids a candy or some change
just as we were about to drive away.</p>

<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">I
did not find an obituary, however, The Moncton Times of  Monday, June
23, 1986 carried the following: 
</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0"> &quot;Black

<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">BLACK
RIVER BRIDGE (Special)  An elderly  Black River Bridge man is dead

at hospital, while his wife, Mary, remains in stable condition  at
Chatham's Hotelo Dieu Hospital.</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">Both
are believed to have been victims of a beating by &quot;several&quot;
persons.</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">Police
are saying little about the attack, but confirm several persons were
questioned late Sunday before  being released. Robbery is presumed to
be the motive for the attack at this point of the investigation.</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">Mary
Glendenning, 62, was apparently tied up by her assailants but managed
to free herself to  telephone for help.  No one else was in the house
at the time.</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">The
attack occurred sometime between 10 pm.and midnight Saturday.  The
Glendenning's store adjacent to the house wasn't broken into,
according to one family member.

<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">Notes
for NORMAN
PETERS
GLENDENNING:</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">Norm
was born on New Year's Eve, 1925, however, when the birth was
registered; it was given as December 31, 1926.  Grandmother
Glendenning was a Peters hence his second name.   According to
Lillian, Mum and Dad had difficulty deciding between the names Norman
and Robert. 
</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0"><br />

</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">Norman
attended the Little Branch School, classes in the Anglican Church in
Bay du Vin and the Miramichi Rural High School.  Before school bus
service was established, Norm used to take a horse to Bay du Vin, and
later Bayside, picking up other students along the way.  The horse
was stabled for the day in either Goymer Williston's or Harrison
Smith's barn.  
</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0"><br />

</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">At
age 18, he enlisted in the army and found himself in the RCEME being
sent first to Camp Utopia outside Saint John, New Brunswick and later
to Woodstock, Ontario and Longueil, Quebec.</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0"><br />

</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">Norm
was a good skater and a good dancer, and usually took me along when I
first started going to dances in 1946. I also remember working with
Norm at the hay; in the woods on cold and snowy Saturdays; butchering
and peddling meat; shearing and dipping sheep and whatever else
needed to be done.  
</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0"><br />

</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">Among
Norm's stories is one about Wallace MacDonald throwing a peavey at
him and Edwin Adams, trips on icy roads up river with Mr. Harper to
tend to a sick horse and the first time he drove a vehicle with
airbrakes.</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0"><br />

</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">Norman
married Jean Watling from Point Aux Carr.  Alton and Eric now operate
the farm although Norm continues to &quot;supervise&quot; and run
errands; most every day he makes a trip to Miramichi City. 
Branchview, the Glendenning farm, is the largest farm east of
Miramichi and one of the largest in the Miramichi area.  Branchview
has been the recipient of a number of awards.  
</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0"><br />

</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">Norman
and Jean always welcome family to the old family home providing a
place at the table for children, siblings, grandchildren, nephews and
nieces alike.  He always tells visiting children where the kittens
were and offers to give them one to take home.  Many young people of
the community earned some money and learned important work habits
while working on the farm with Norman and the &quot;boys&quot;.  
</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0"><br />

</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">Norm's
early years were filled with long evenings of farm chores on top of
full days driving truck for Alfred MacDonald or with John pressing
hay.   
</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0"><br />

</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">  For
a number of years Norman served as a trustee of the Black River
Community Hall including during a major renovation in the 1960's and
reconstruction in the 1970''s; was a director of Agricultural Society
#103 and was a Director of the Northumberland Cooperative Dairy.  He
participates in local political meetings.  Although not one to
travel, in &quot;retirement&quot; he takes time to visit neighbours
and friends around Black River.</p>

<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">Notes
for GRACE
ELIZABETH
GLENDENNING:</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">Lillian
said that Grace attended Armstrong School in Parksville, Tenn</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0"><br />

</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">Grace
was the oldest in the family and was born in Parksville, Tennessee. 
Dad and Mum had set up housekeeping there in February 1911 where Dad
worked on Ocoee #1, the first of three dams build on the Ocoee River.
 Aunt Janet had journeyed to Parksville to be with Mum when Grace was
born.  
</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0"><br />

</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0"> When
Grace was young, Dad and Mum moved from construction site to
construction site in the US and, presumably, Grace attended school
wherever she was; one school was the Armstrong School but I am not
sure if it was in Connecticut or Virginia.  The family returned to NB
in 1919 and, again, presumably Grace attended the Little Branch
School.  Later she attended Success Business College in Moncton, NB
where she took a business program.  While she made good marks,
apparently she did not like the program.  It was when returning from
Business College with Grace, that Dad upset the Model T at Gilbert's
Corner, near Shediac.  Grace broke her wrist but even so, went to a
dance in the Little Branch School that night.</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0"><br />

</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">Like
so many other Maritimers, Grace went to Boston to work, probably in
1930 and worked for various families caring for children and likely
cooking.  . On her first trip, she traveled with Mrs. F. A. Fowlie
and Ernest MacLean who were going to Lowell, Mass to visit relatives.
 She may have she stayed for a while with Dad's cousin, Sam Knowles. 
At one time she lived at 1595 Beacon Street, Beverley, Mass. She
frequently visited her Uncle Jack Watling in Boston and later when he
lived on Swan's Island near Eastport, Maine.  Grace returned
regularly to Little Branch for the summer coming sometimes by steamer
from Boston to Saint John, NB.  (I believe that the fare to Saint
John was $10.00)  In 1947, when I left home for Teachers' College in
Fredericton, I inherited Grace's steamer trunk - and it carried my
belongings on a number of later trips.</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0"><br />

</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">As
a young woman in Little Branch and later in Boston, Grace loved to
square dance; Lillian said that the night she landed in Boston in
1933, she went to a dance with Grace.  Perhaps that is where she met
Roy Morrison Smith (1908-1985).   Roy, I believe, preferred to round
dance.   She and Roy were married in St. Paul's Presbyterian Church
on August 26, 1936.  In 1936, Walter, Dad, Elinor and I drove to
Boston to bring Grace home.    After marriage, Grace and Roy lived
with Roy's mother in Saugus, Mass, later moving to 23 Spring Street
in Malden. While in Saugus, Grace worked for Chisholm's Motel on
Route 1.   One evening while standing on the sidewalk near her home
in Malden talking to a neighbour, a man came along, knocked her off
her feet and stole her purse.  
</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0"><br />

</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0"><br />

</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">Grace,
Roy and family were frequent visitors to Little Branch and even when
they could not come, their children made the trip.  My recollection
is that Barbara and Lawrence spent 16 consecutive summers with their
Grandmother at Little Branch.  Often they came by train but also
frequently traveled with expatriate New Brunswick folk who were
visiting family in the Miramichi.  I can remember being wakened in
the middle of the night when Grace arrived home.  She had brought
some clothes for me and wanted to see them on me.  The story is told
that one summer when Grace was home and helping with the cooking and
Ken was a toddler, Grace would jam Ken's dress in the pantry door in
order to keep him out of her way.  In later years, Grace frequently
landed home carrying shopping bags with fresh tomatoes from Roy's
garden, bagels for Jean MacKenzie and the usual things for family
members.  
</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0"><br />

</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">Grace
had extraordinary eyesight. While walking through a field she could
reach down and pick a four leaf clover. One time she entered a
contest, which required her to count the dots in a picture of a TV. 
She won, and then decided she should count the dots again in case she
was asked the number at the presentation ceremony.  I know that she
also won other contests but cannot recall which ones.  As a
youngster, I can recall going with Grace and others to pick
blueberries and raspberries and of walking through the fields.  I am
not sure if we were going somewhere or just for a walk. 
</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">Although
she left New Brunswick as a young woman, she did not lose interest in
family, friends or the community.  She subscribed to the Chatham
Gazette for many years and was well informed about activities among
her extended family. She was proud of her family, fiercely loyal,
generous to a fault and she and Roy always welcomed and provided
shelter for the many visiting family members.  She was quick to
arrange for visitors to see the Museum of Science, visit down town
Boston, see the Saugus Iron works, etc.  
</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0"><br />

</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">During
her later years Grace had a form of multiple sclerosis and had
difficulty walking.  She then moved to Cliffside Nursing Home and
Winthrop, Mass.  She is buried in the Black River Cemetery.</p>

<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">Notes
for WALTER
JUBAL
GLENDENNING:</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">Walter
was born in New Brunswick; Mother had come back from Tennessee to New
Brunswick for his birth and may have stayed in NB until late 1916 -
we do not know for sure. The family returned permanently to Little
Branch in 1919 and it is likely that is where Walter started school
-.  It is likely that he only went to school for 6-8 years and then
would have worked with Dad on the farm. 
</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0"><br />

</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">Walter
did not talk much about his early years but I know that he worked
long hours both summer and winter.  Because Dad was such a worker and
Walter was the oldest boy in the family, I am sure that a great deal
was expected of him.  He had a team of dogs, Chowder and Pup, which
he hitched to a sled in winter and traveled around the community, and
cross to visit Alex Newton.  Once he took Dad across to George Adams'
to use the phone. The longest trip, Walter said, was to John W.
MacNaughton's - a distance of about 7 miles.  
</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0"><br />

</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">Canobie
and Black River Glendenning family members kept in touch and visited
back and forth. One time, the Christmas, 1938 I believe, Walter was
taking family members to Chatham in the Model A.  The right front
window was broken and was replaced with a piece of cardboard.  Seems
to me that Mum, Ken, Norm, Lillian and I were in the car.  As we
neared the railroad tracks, Walter spotted a train approaching from
the right.  He tried to stop but the car kept sliding towards the
tracks.  Quick thinking, he tramped on the gas instead and got across
just ahead of the train.  People on the back of Adams' truck just
ahead of us were sure that we were going to be hit.</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0"><br />

</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">Walter
began building a home on the Dan MacLean place in 1937 and moved into
it on November 1, 1940.  In the meantime, they lived at Little
Branch.  The basement was dug with the aid of a horse, Jess, and a
scoop and most if not all of the lumber came from Hallidays.  The
original barn on the property burned in 1932, the same year as the
Black River Hall.  His house was struck by lightning in 1940 but did
not burn.</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0"><br />

</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">Although
Walter farmed, he also worked off the farm.  In 1940 he worked at
clearing the bombing range along the Loggieville Road.  He was called
to the Army Service Corps during the war and was stationed at Ottawa,
Halifax, Debert and Camp Borden.  On his return, he continued to farm
and to work at the airport.  In 1950 he commenced work with Modern
Construction Co. Ltd. In 1959 he moved to Moncton and continued to
work for Modern at job sites throughout New Brunswick including their
head office in Moncton.  He retired in 1978.</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0"><br />

</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">Dad
was one of the promoters of farmers working together and was
Secretary Treasurer of the Agricultural Society #103.  Part of the
role was to maintain a &quot;store&quot; from which seeds, etc. would
be sold.  After Dad died, Walter took over the role and moved the
shed from the Branch to his place.</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0"><br />

</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">Walter
and Agnes always welcomed visitors - family and friends alike - and
they were good hosts.  A meal seemed to appear effortlessly and
Walter encouraged visitors to &quot;eat up and give the house a good
name.&quot;  He liked to travel and visit family and friends in
Bathurst, Rexton, Harvey Station and down to the Boston area.   He
also traveled widely stopping to see men he had worked with.   For a
while they owned a cottage Florina Beach near Cocagne, NB.  
</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0"><br />

</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">Walter
is also remembered for his keen memory.  He seemed to remember anyone
he ever worked with, perhaps even met, and would visit if he was
passing nearby.  He enjoyed reminiscing but talked little about what
himself.  
</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0"><br />

</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">Walter
loved to visit the old home, &quot;The Branch.&quot;  A few years
ago, when he was not able to drive, I arranged to pick him up for a
day's outing.  When we got into the car I said, &quot;We can go any
where you would like.  Would you like to go to the Island?  Saint
John? Fredericton? Springhill? Or where?&quot;  He hesitated only for
a moment then said, &quot;I think that I'd like to go to the Branch&quot;.

<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0"> Agnes
was born in Black River and attended the Middle Black River (Cameron)
school and was a member of St. Paul's Presbyterian Church; like so
many young women, Agnes went to Boston to work (She had relatives
there) but came home most summers.  I remember one year of Agnes
coming to our place driving her brother's (?) car.  Cannot remember
the make but it would be a 1930-something with extra wheels mounted
on each front fender complete with silver spokes and whitewall tires.</p>

<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">In
the late 1950's, Walters work transferred him to Moncton.  Shortly

for VENETIA
KATHERINE
GLENDENNING:</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0"> Venetia
was born at Little Branch.  Mum and Dad were living in Little Branch
at the time.  Venetia attended the Little Branch School for Grades
1-8, the highest grade available in the Little Branch School, and
then she 
</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">stayed
with Aunt Tine in Loggieville where she completed Grade nine. 
Following that, she wrote Entrance Exams and gained First Class
Entrance to the Provincial Normal School from which she graduated in
1933.  As I recall, Venetia taught in New Carlysle, Napan, Penniac
and Bayside; she may also have taught somewhere north of Fredericton.
 She also taught in Point Aux Carr, Little Branch, Miramichi Rural
High School and Chatham retiring in 1975.  Quite a number of people
at her wake mentioned that Venetia had been their teacher.</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0"><br />

</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">Venetia
was active in her church, St. Paul's Presbyterian.  She probably
attended Sunday school at St. Stephen's Presbyterian Church prior to
it becoming St. Stephen's United Church.  When St. Paul's opened in
1930, there was a PYPS rally prior to the church opening. And Venetia
was President of the Young Peoples Society.  The local paper,
presumably the Chatham Gazette, noted, &quot;Miss Venetia
Glendenning, President Black River Y.P.S, in a very pleasing manner
welcomed the delegates…&quot; Venetia was a member of St. Paul's
since its establishment, played the organ for many years and for 40
years was Church Treasurer.  She was also a member of the Women's
Missionary Society and the Women's League.</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0"><br />

</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">Venetia
met Cameron Russell (1906-1979) in the spring of 1932 at Little
Branch.  Cam was rafting logs for Harrison Murdoch and they tied up
at the wharf.  Cam and perhaps other members of the crew came over to
talk to the girls in the schoolyard.  They married in St. Paul's
Presbyterian Church and lived in Point Aux Carr in a home they bought
from Mrs. Simon MacDonald.  Mrs. MacDonald retained a room which she
used mainly in the summer.  Cam and Venetia had three children,
Glenn, Leonard and Donna.</p>

<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">Venetia
was an avid reader, a good listener and a good sport.  She was a good
conversationalist but not one to gossip or be critical of others. 
She demanded nothing, asked little and offered much.  She did not
complain and was always &quot;fine&quot; when asked about her own
health.  She did not want to bother people.  She could entertain
herself and did not mind living alone.  In fact, she lived alone for
20 years after she became a widow.</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0"><br />

</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">Venetia
was a resource for information about her community and we shared an
interest in genealogy; she provided me with much of my initial
information about the Watling side of the family.  She could recall
family relationships from memory whereas I have to rely on my notes
and records.</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0"><br />

</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">Venetia
and Cam had many trips to Florida with Ken and Verne.  When lighting
her stove to warm the house on return from one trip in 1989 or 1990,
the house caught fire and burned.  She rebuilt on the same site. 
Venetia and Cam visited Donna and Vernon when they lived in Vancouver
and later in England and, while in England, traveled with the family
by car around Europe.  
</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0"><br />

</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">As
a youngster, I recall the nice table Venetia set at mealtime.  A
visit to Venetia's always ended in lunch before leaving.  Sometimes
when visiting the Miramichi in recent years, I would drop in on
Venetia's about 8:00 am and enjoy toast, jam, tea and conversation. 
She kept scotch cookies in her freezer and always set some out when
she knew I was coming for a visit.</p>

<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">Cam
was born and lived all his life in Point Aux Carr.  He was a
fisherman - smelts in the winter and salmon in the summer.  At one
time he fished just off-shore from where he lived but the fishing by
set nets was banned and he &quot;drifted&quot; for salmon.  He also
farmed.  When courting Venetia, he would often bicycle to Little
Branch only to be asked to a barber to the Glendenning boys.</p>

<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">Notes
for LILLIAN
ELSPETH
GLENDENNING:</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">Lillian
was born at 3 Perkins St., Fairhaven, Conn., USA, where Dad was
working at the time.  She would have traveled with the family to
Hampton, Virginia and Muscle Shoals, Alabama before returning to
Little Branch in 1919.  She attended Little Branch School for a few
years but admitted that she did not like school.  
</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0"><br />

</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">In
school, students required a slate cloth and water to main clean
slates.  Once Lillian dropped her slate cloth and instead of picking
it up, tied the ankle of the student in front of her to the leg of
the desk.  When the teacher called the girl to come to the board, the
slate cloth tripped her.</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0"><br />

</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">Dad
was returning from Moncton; Lillian was with him and maybe others. 
Near Rexton, a car tried to run him off the road.  Lillian thought
that they were rumrunners but perhaps the rum was inside them rather
than just in the car.  Dad pulled in to a store/gas station and
phoned the RCMP.  A police car came from Newcastle.  Lillian
remembered riding in the police car as far as John W. MacNaughton's.</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0"><br />

</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">Lillian
was a close friend of Maxine Macdonald and they used to visit back
and forth.  One of Mum's tricks was to ask Lillian to take a note
over to Maxine's mother.  She dutifully carried the noted a half-mile
to Maxine's place.  She did not know it at the time, but the note
simply said &quot;Please send Lillian home after a while.&quot;</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0"><br />

</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0"><br />

</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">At
age 16, Lillian was glad to go to Boston to work.  Ken remembers the
phone call from her sister, Grace, who was living on Beacon Street at
the time, saying that there was a job for her in Boston; Walter took
Mum, Venetia and Lillian to catch the train at Newcastle.  She
arrived in Boston on September 22, 1933 and, I think, stayed with
Dad's cousin, Sam Knowles, for a while.  That night, she went to a
dance with Grace and Roy to celebrate Grace's 22nd birthday. (Dates
don't quite match)</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0"><br />

</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">While
in Boston, Lillian did housework and looked after children first for
Mrs. Fineberg, who was a singer, and later for Mrs. Piser.  Her last
employer was Mrs. Walker where she worked for 5-6 years.  One of her
addresses was &quot;61 Mayo Avenue, Needham.&quot;</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0"><br />

</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">Brydone
and Lillian met on April 18, 1933 while Lillian was visiting with
Aunt Tine in Loggieville.  There was a service in the United Church
and afterward the young people played badminton.  Brydone walked
Lillian back to Aunt Tine's.  They courted for over 6 years.  Lillian
came home most summers but Brydone also visited her in Boston.  In
1936, Brydone and Walter traveled to Boston by train stopping to
visit in Portland on the way.  Brydone and his mother drove Lillian
back to Boston in 1936 after Grace's wedding.</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0"><br />

</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">I
can remember Brydone coming to court Lillian in his Dad's car (a 1935
Ford perhaps); I would hang around the front door and as they got
into the car.  Occasionally, Brydone would invite me to get in and go
for a ride.  Sometimes the ride would include a trip to the
&quot;Bayshore&quot; and end with a cone of ice cream.</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0"><br />

</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">Lillian
and Kenneth Brydone Weeks (July 6, 1917 - Sept 16, 1994) were married
at Little Branch on December 22, 1939. by Rev. P. McK. Sampson,
Minister of the Sunny Corner Presbyterian Church and they lived in
Loggieville.  Shortly after, Brydone enlisted in the North Shore
Regiment.  Lillian lived for a while in Woodstock, and Sussex as well
as Camp Borden.  She and the family lived in Loggieville (13 Church
Lane?) while Brydone was overseas.  .</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0"><br />

</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">Lillian
was a people person.  She was active in her church.  She enjoyed
company, was a great conversationalist and enjoyed both hearing and
telling jokes.  Although she did not play any musical instrument she
often sang while working around the house.  She also sang in the
choir and I can still hear her singing The Old Rugged Cross. 
Lillian, Brydone and daughter, Patricia, frequently led special
church services with readings and song.</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">Lillian
was a note-maker.  She maintained a record of dates of events from
her community and from Black River.  In 1974-75, Lillian typed 144
pages of memories of her early years.  In 1995, I arranged for them
to be printed and she gave copies to family and a few close friends. 
Among other things, Lillian remembered visiting Bird Hill to observe
the &quot;Zepplin&quot;, a German dirigible pass on its way to New
York.  That is the dirigible famous for having burst into flames
while moored in New Jersey.</p>

for KENNETH
BRYDONE
WEEKS:</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">Brydone
was born in Loggieville and graduated from the Loggieville High
School.  For a number of years he worked for A&amp;R Loggie Company
delivering groceries and feed with one of his regular routes being
Loggieville to Escuminac.  People would phone in their orders and
Brydone would deliver.  Once or twice he took me with him and bought
lunch while in Escuminac.  It was quite a treat.</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0"><br />

</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">Brydone
always wanted to farm and after leaving the army purchased a dairy
farm near Harvey Station.  Brydone was always active in his church
and, in late 1964; Brydone accepted a call to minister in a
three-point Presbyterian charge with a manse provided in Stanley;
Lillian and Brydone lived there until their retirement.</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0"><br />

</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">After
Brydone retired, Lillian usually accompanied him when he substituted
throughout Southern New Brunswick for ministers who were ill or on
vacation.  After Brydone died, Lillian moved to Harvey Station, then
with Ken and Beverley but eventually moved into a senior's home in
MacAdam.</p>

<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">Their
homes in Harvey Station and in Stanley were favourite stopping places
when traveling through to Boston - as well as just for family visits.
 I frequently stayed there.  In fact, at Easter of 1955, I was

that I had won a Beaverbrook Overseas Scholarship.

<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">Notes
for JOHN
FRANKLIN
GLENDENNING:</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">John
was born at Little Branch shortly after the family returned to
Canada.  He attended the Little Branch School probably for 7 or 8
years, and then he worked on the farm.  Dad had not been well for a
number of years so Walter and John did the farm work.   
</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0"><br />

</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">John
and Walter hauled fish from Hardwicke to Chatham, cut hardwood on the
&quot;ridge&quot; and delivered it to Loggieville and Chatham.  One
day they would go to Hardwicke or Baie St. Anne (including Fred
Savoie's) and bring fish back to the Branch; the next day, they
delivered the fish to Chatham for $5.00 per ton (two box-sled loads).
 They went to the woods and cut and split a cord of hardwood and the
next day delivered it to Loggieville or Chatham for $5.00 including
the cost of the wood.   
</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0"><br />

</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">John
worked hard and put in long hours.  He expected others to do their
bit whether it was bringing in the wood for the stove, doing barn
chores, going to the woods in winter, making hay in summer, etc.  It
was expected and you did it.  But he was also very generous to people
needing help.    
</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0"><br />

</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">In
the late 1930's John, along with some other young men from Black
River including Tom Harper, Theodore Fowlie, took an agricultural
course in Newcastle.  The course included practical farm mechanics,
agriculture, book keeping, general mechanics and woodworking.  As
part of the course, John made a beautiful birch desk, which he
finished in walnut.  I also remember that he learned a new technique
for killing chickens.  I believe that it was then or shortly
thereafter, that John rigged up a wind generator on the roof of the
barn which would charge a battery and provide light.</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0"><br />

</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">One
winter, November I believe, he and Brydone Weeks (Brydone was home on
leave, probably before he went overseas) built a tractor out of an
Oakland front end (a car that belonged to Alex MacDonald) and a
Godferson rear end (a truck used by the A&amp;R Loggie Co) - and they
did this in Walter's old shed without the aid of welding and cutting
equipment (or heat). The tractor had two transmissions.  The tractor
was very powerful but the too heavy for soft ground.</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0"><br />

</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">During
the winter of 1945-46, and perhaps winters previous to this, John,
Ken and Norm all worked in the woods for Hubert Matchett of Sunny
Corner.  They would be gone all week and I did the barn work.</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0"><br />

</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">As
a young lad going on 17, I went to work on the boats in Chatham
loading pulp and pit props.  (I am sure that I got my first job based
on the reputation of John, Ken and Norm.)  One day we were storing
8-foot props down in the hold.  They are heavy enough anyway but
these were also moldy; I was struggling and John knew it.  John said,
&quot;Let me take that one, Donald&quot;.  And it happened many
times.  
</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0"><br />

</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">For
a number of years John went from farm to farm along the Miramichi
pressing hay, first with a horse powered hay press but later with a
press operated off a tractor.  (When pressing hay at home, it was my
job to keep the horse moving and to prevent it from grabbing at the
hay when it went past the end of the bundle.)  Bundles of hay weighed
between 80 to 120 pounds.  John worked all around Black River, Napan,
Barnaby River, Cains River, etc.  For a number of years, John owned a
3-ton Dodge truck, which I believe he bought from Hubert Matchett,
and trucked pulp, pit props, gravel, lime, fertilizer, hay and
Christmas trees.</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0"><br />

</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0"><br />

</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">In
1946-47 John and Mary built a new house on the Bob MacLean property
and in the spring of 1948 opened a store in their living room.  In
1968 they built a new store nearer the road and put in gas tanks. 
John was very entrepreneurial selling groceries, flour, feed,
plumbing, furnaces and anything else to make a buck.</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0"><br />

</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">John
received his call for military service and, I believe, went to
Fredericton for a physical.  He had very poor eyesight and was turned
down.  He probably would not have had to serve anyway, because
farming was an essential service and he was needed at home.  Ken and
Norm were already in the Service and I was too young to take over the
responsibility of farming.  
</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0"><br />

</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">When
Ken and Norm were in the service, I was the only one around to help
with the farm work.  Since Dad died when I was very young, you might
say that I learned to work under John's direction.  I recall going to
the woods in the winter, sitting on the bob-sled and on the load of
wood on the way home, building loads of loose hay and poisoning
potato bugs early in the morning to take advantage of heavy dew. 
John was the only one of the boys who would sing while driving to and
from the fields or woods - I especially remember him singing familiar
hymns.</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0"><br />

</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">Many
of the older people in Black River will remember the 1939 Ford
half-ton truck that, as I recall, John purchased from Bonnie
Flanagan.  It was a far cry from the old Model A.  The truck had
wooden cab on the back and John would take people to town on Saturday
night when the stores were open.  There could be a 10-12 people in
the back.  I think that he charged one dollar.  The last thing before
leaving town, he would drive up Water Street and past Ben's Canteen
to see if anyone needed a lift home.  
</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0"><br />

</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">John
and Mary liked to visit family and friends around the Miramichi and
Bathurst.  John and Mary, with Margaret and Jeannie, made their first
trip to Florida over Christmas of 1958.  Carol and I went with them
to help with the driving.  Later, they managed to visit Florida for a
month most winters always stopping to see family and friend in
Florida and on the way.  When our children were small and we visited
Black River, John always had gave the kids a candy or some change
just as we were about to drive away.</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0"><br />

</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">I
did not find an obituary, however, The Moncton Times of  Monday, June
23, 1986 carried the following: 
</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0"> &quot;Black
River Bridge couple beaten</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">Man
dead, wife hurt in robbery</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">BLACK

persons.</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">Police
are saying little about the attack, but confirm several persons were
questioned late Sunday before  being released. Robbery is presumed to
be the motive for the attack at this point of the investigation.</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">Mary
Glendenning, 62, was apparently tied up by her assailants but managed
to free herself to  telephone for help.  No one else was in the house
at the time.</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">The
attack occurred sometime between 10 pm.and midnight Saturday.  The
Glendenning's store adjacent to the house wasn't broken into,
according to one family member.

<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">Notes
for ELINOR
JEAN
GLENDENNING:</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">Elinor,
her Dad called her Nen, was born after the family returned to Canada;
she attended the Little Branch School to the end of Grade 8.  She
then wrote High School Entrance exams and attended high school
classes in Bay du Vin.  
</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">She
usually walked to Bay du Vin, a distance of 5 miles, but sometimes
rode her bicycle.  In the winter she boarded at Barbour Williston's. 
On a beautiful sunny day in early September, 1935, I walked with
Elinor to my first day at school.  She wrote and passed her Junior
Matriculation. 
</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0"><br />

</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">By
1933, Grace, Venetia and Lillian had left home and Elinor would have
been the only daughter at home to help Mum. With Dad and five boys at
home, while still going to school, and without electricity or running
water, the work would have been heavy, indeed.</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0"><br />

</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">Elinor
met Earl   when he worked and stayed at home.  They lived at the
Branch until, I think, Earl went in the army then they bought a house
on Harriman Lane in Loggieville.  As best I can remember, Elinor
stayed in Loggieville all the time Earl was in the service.</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0"><br />

</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">In
the summer of 1949, Elinor and Earl and family moved to Black River. 
Alex MacDonald had been killed in an accident and W. S. Loggie
Company held the mortgage on his property.  Elinor turned over their
house in Loggieville to Loggie's and paid the difference - $300.  I
moved their belongings from Loggieville to Black River in the 1949
red Chev ½ ton truck.  On one trip, we stopped to see Norm who was
cutting grain in the field below John's house.</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0"><br />

</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">As
her family got older, Elinor did housework for a number of people in
Chatham and at CFB Chatham.  She also worked at the Miramichi
Seniors' Home in Chatham and at the Rehabilitation Centre.  Elinor
was active in St. Paul's Presbyterian Church being a member of both
the Women's League and the Presbyterian Missionary Society, a member
of the Women's Institute and an active Member of the Black River
Community Hall Committee.  The hall had burned and a new building was
constructed.  (This was the second time that the Black River Hall had
burned.).  She phoned me to tell me about the fire; a few days later
she went into the hospital and died after a brief illness.</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0"><br />

</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">Once
when having supper after a day digging potatoes, we were sitting at
the dining room table.  Uncle Jim was there because it was the custom
for neighbours to exchange labour while cutting wood, threshing,
picking potatoes etc.  It was dark so there was an oil lamp on the
table.  Elinor went to reach across for butter and poked her knife
through the lamp globe.  Of course, the flame went out as a result of
the air rushing in.</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0"><br />

</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">Elinor
wrote regularly when I was in England and her letters were always
newsy.  At Christmas of 1955 - my first Christmas away from home, I
recall coming back to the residence late on Christmas day to find a
letter waiting for me from Elinor.  (Only in England would mail be
delivered on Christmas day.)  She also wrote a letter every day to
her son, Robert, when he lived in Toronto.</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">Elinor
was a &quot;high-energy&quot; person - some may say it was a nervous
energy.  She was a good worker, had a quick turn of mind, was
fiercely loyal, and quick to support or defend family members.  She
also had a temper.  Once when she was young, Mum sent the youngsters
upstairs to make their Valentines.  (Ken says that Jamie Mortimer and
Ward Godfrey were at home at the time).  Elinor and Norm had a spat
and Norm tried to take the scissors from her and cut his hand. 
Elinor enjoyed hockey and was a fan of the Montreal Canadiens.  She
was a good letter writer and wrote to her son, Robert, every day but
two during the years he lived in Toronto.  I forget the reason for
the first day she did not write but the second was the day she was
admitted to the hospital just before she died. The following tribute
was written by Mrs. Donald Angus MacDonald.</p>

for EARL
A.
TAYLOR:</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">Earl
grew up in Napan and attended the Napan school.  As a young man, he
worked around Napan and later did general farm work for Elmer
Glendenning including haying, barn work and cutting wood in the
winter.  He joined the army in 194? And, as I recall, was stationed
in Fredericton, New Brunswick. Earl was discharged from the army on
February 15, 1946 and worked at the Chatham air base.  .

<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">Earl
had purchased a beautiful cream, chrome and red bicycle - double
bars, handle bars and all.  It was a far cry from the old bicycle
which Walter had as a kid and which we, and half Black River, learned
to ride on. Sometimes Earl would take me on the parcel carrier;
sometimes he even let me take it by myself.  One evening, just at
dusk, he took me across to the field just behind Uncle Jim's shed
where Uncle Jim was burning piles of brush</p>

for KENNETH
ELMER
GLENDENNING:</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">Ken
attended the Little Branch School to the end of Grade 8, took classes
in the Bay du Vin Hall and graduated from MRHS.  One year he stayed
with Venetia and Cam in Point Aux Carr, went to school, and did the
chores while Cam fished smelts.  After High school, Ken took a
business course in Newcastle</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0"><br />

</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">In
1943, Ken enlisted in the RCAF; he phoned Mum from Moncton and, as I
recall, Walter, Mum and I saw him at the Newcastle station when the
train stopped briefly.  His first posting was to Toronto for basic
training then to Galt for technical training as an airframe mechanic;
later postings included St. John's, Quebec and Scoudouc, New
Brunswick.  He brought an airman from BC home for Christmas that
first Christmas.  After demobilization, he worked on the Miramichi
including winters in the woods for Hubert Matchett and summers
loading pulp and pit props on the boats. 
</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0"><br />

</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">In
1948 he took a carpentry course in Moncton and, after doing carpentry
work for a while, in 1950 he re-enlisted in the RCAF and his postings
included Trenton, Calgary, Armstrong, Resolute, Moncton, Scoudouc,
Greenwood, Ottawa and Chatham.  He retired from the air force 1984
after having a stroke.</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0"><br />

</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">In
October 1939, Ken and I both came down with scarlet fever a week
apart.  I think the quarantine period was 6 weeks - a red warning
sign was posted by the front door. We shared the bedroom on the
ground floor.  Then Ken came down with complications and I was moved
to the small bedroom upstairs.  That was the time that &quot;Old
Jess&quot;, our faithful old horse, was put down.</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0"><br />

</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">Ken
did all the usual farm work including collecting sap from which Mum
made maple syrup.  I recall going with Ken with a horse and sled,
with cream cans and the barrel from the churn, to collect sap before
we went to school in the morning.</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0"><br />

</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">Ken
has stories to tell about Venetia catching him when he tumbled out of
the car on a turn in the Bathurst Road, getting pecked near an eye by
a hen, and Wallace MacDonald's visit to the Little Branch School.  
</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0"><br />

</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">While
in the service, Ken worked as a carpenter in the evening and on
Saturdays wherever he was posted; he built his own home in Napan,
Venetia's home after her fire and a home for his in-laws after their
fire.  He pitched in to help others building homes, barns, sheds,
etc.</p>

</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0"><br />

</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">Ken
has a great memory and likes to recount jokes and stories of
yesteryear.  I often check with him on items about family tree
information.  He attends in local political meetings.  At age 80 he
purchased a computer and has learned the intricacies of email, games,
and the internet and later he registered on Facebook.  Ken and Verne
are regular participants in the seniors' card games at the Black
River Hall and impromptu games either at their home or the home of
friends.  When in the service, he was an active curler.</p>

</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">Notes
for NORMAN
PETERS
GLENDENNING:</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">Norm
was born on New Year's Eve, 1925, however, when the birth was
registered; it was given as December 31, 1926.  Grandmother
Glendenning was a Peters hence his second name.   According to
Lillian, Mum and Dad had difficulty deciding between the names Norman
and Robert. 
</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0"><br />

</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">Norman
attended the Little Branch School, classes in the Anglican Church in
Bay du Vin and the Miramichi Rural High School.  Before school bus
service was established, Norm used to take a horse to Bay du Vin, and
later Bayside, picking up other students along the way.  The horse
was stabled for the day in either Goymer Williston's or Harrison
Smith's barn.  
</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0"><br />

</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">At
age 18, he enlisted in the army and found himself in the RCEME being
sent first to Camp Utopia outside Saint John, New Brunswick and later
to Woodstock, Ontario and Longueil, Quebec.</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0"><br />

</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">Norm
was a good skater and a good dancer, and usually took me along when I
first started going to dances in 1946. I also remember working with
Norm at the hay; in the woods on cold and snowy Saturdays; butchering
and peddling meat; shearing and dipping sheep and whatever else
needed to be done.  
</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0"><br />

</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">Among
Norm's stories is one about Wallace MacDonald throwing a peavey at
him and Edwin Adams, trips on icy roads up river with Mr. Harper to
tend to a sick horse and the first time he drove a vehicle with
airbrakes.</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0"><br />

</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">Norman
married Jean Watling from Point Aux Carr.  Alton and Eric now operate
the farm although Norm continues to &quot;supervise&quot; and run
errands; most every day he makes a trip to Miramichi City. 
Branchview, the Glendenning farm, is the largest farm east of
Miramichi and one of the largest in the Miramichi area.  Branchview
has been the recipient of a number of awards.  
</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0"><br />

</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">Norman
and Jean always welcome family to the old family home providing a
place at the table for children, siblings, grandchildren, nephews and
nieces alike.  He always tells visiting children where the kittens
were and offers to give them one to take home.  Many young people of
the community earned some money and learned important work habits
while working on the farm with Norman and the &quot;boys&quot;.  
</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0"><br />

</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">Norm's
early years were filled with long evenings of farm chores on top of
full days driving truck for Alfred MacDonald or with John pressing
hay.   
</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0"><br />

</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">  For
a number of years Norman served as a trustee of the Black River
Community Hall including during a major renovation in the 1960's and
reconstruction in the 1970''s; was a director of Agricultural Society
#103 and was a Director of the Northumberland Cooperative Dairy.  He
participates in local political meetings.  Although not one to
travel, in &quot;retirement&quot; he takes time to visit neighbours
and friends around Black River.</p>

for DONALD
ERNEST
MALCOLM
GLENDENNING:</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">Don
was born at Little Branch on September 8, 1929 and was baptized in
the new St. Paul's Presbyterian Church in Black River on opening day,
July 20, 1930.  Like the rest of the family, he attended the Little
Branch School; he also graduated from the Miramichi Rural High
School.</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0"><br />

</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">He
completed a six-month teacher training program at Teachers' College
in Fredericton in June 1947 and his first teaching position was at
Middle Kouchibouguac.  Over the next few years he mixed teaching and
study completing a PhD at Indiana University in 1964.  He also taught
at the Miramichi Rural High School and the New Brunswick Institute of
Technology. In 1969, after a number of years with the Federal
Government, he moved to Prince Edward Island to become the first
President of Holland College.  He also was active in a number of
national professional organizations.  
</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0"><br />

</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">After
retiring from Holland College in 1987, he set up his own company and
engaged in educational consulting in Canada and abroad.  His overseas
contracts provided many travel opportunities especially to Asia and
Africa.</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0"><br />

</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">He
was bitten early by the travel bug and, either for business or
pleasure, visited most every corner of Canada, most US states, and 40
countries in all. As a family, they lived in Moncton, Bloomington
(Indiana), Ottawa, Vancouver and now in Charlottetown.  Don and Carol
continue to travel and usually spend some time each winter in the
southern USA. 
</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0"><br />

</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">After
retirement, Don resumed his interest in genealogy and visited
Callister Hall, Scotland, where his great grandfather was born in
1807.  He publishes a Family Chronicle, an informal and occasional
newsletter, which, thanks to Brian, is posted on the family website. 
The Newsletter carries both family and personal recollections of
growing up in Black River.</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0"><br />

</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">Retirement
activities include genealogy, reading, volunteer work, travel,
gardening, writing, letters to the editor - and working on his
&quot;farm&quot;.  Don was awarded the Order of Canada in 1986.</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0"><br />

</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">Childhood
memories include picking wild blueberries, mayflowers, cherries,
plums, strawberries, cranberries and mushrooms; hours spent with
George Watling playing in and along the brook; our water diversion
projects during spring run-off; the family going to church by horse
and wagon; Sunday school under the huge tree in Uncle Jim's back
yard; dances in the Black River hall, at Mel Adams hall and
elsewhere; Saturday nights cruising the streets in Chatham, and many
more.</p>

CHESNEY:</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">Don
married Carol Chesney from Peoria, Illinois.  Of the family, Carol,
Brian, Janet and the grandchildren are all dual-citizens of Canada
and the USA.  Carol is a graduate of Peoria High School, trained as a
nurse at Methodist Hospital in Peoria and nursed in Stamford
Connecticut and Moncton, NB.  Carol traveled from Stamford to Moncton
in the middle of winter, wondering, as the train carried her through
the woods of Maine and New Brunswick, where in the world she was
going.</p>

</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">Carol
likes to travel; their most exotic trip was a safari in Tanzania,

Peter Lind Sunday, July 19, 2009, Bryan Peter Lind succumbed to his
illness at St. Joseph's Hospital in Comox, B.C. Though Dad was
diagnosed with terminal cancer in April 2008 &amp; given a poor
prognosis he went at it with a positive attitude and we were blessed
with 16 months of quality time. While we knew someday it would - 'the
end' seemed to come suddenly - thankfully for his sake it was quick,
&amp; merciful with his family by his side. Bryan was born in
Camrose, Alberta May 12, 1930 - his growing years were spent between
St. Albert, Alta &amp; Kyuquot &amp; Port Alberni on Vancouver
Island. He started his working years in the Lumber Industry in Port
Alberni. Dad joined the RCAF in 1950 - after 20 years of serving in
Canada &amp; Europe he returned to the forest industry. He retired as
a Lumber Inspector from Tahsis in 1990 - he and Mom moved to the
Comox Valley where his passion for golf was born. Bryan was
predeceased by his Father &amp; Mother - Martin &amp; Eleanor Lind &amp;
his sister, Clarice Pownall. He leaves to mourn the love of his life,
his wife Dorothy; five sons - Ian (Carol), Kevin (Carrie), Carl
(Carole), Eric (Patti), Andy (Heidi); &amp; his daughter Kathy Seaker
(Greg). He will also be missed by his three closest grandchildren
Shannon, Shayne, &amp; Bryan; his 102 year old Auntie Kissa; his
sister Doris Olstad (Bud); many nieces, nephews, cousins, &amp; very
dear friends. In lieu of flowers please make donations to St.
Joseph's Hospital or a charity of your choice. We wish to extend our
deepest gratitude to everyone involved in Bryan's medical care - with
extra thanks to Dr. Bearstain, &amp; most especially to Dad &amp;
Mom's family physician - Dr. Thomas Gornall. Memorial Service to be
held on Saturday, July 25th from 11:00 am - 1:00 pm @ the Courtenay
Legion, 367 Cliffe Avenue. Arrangements entrusted to Comox Valley
Funeral Home, Cremation &amp; Reception Centre, Courtenay, B.C. (250)

ALBERT
SMITH:</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">Judith
Gaines of the Boston globe wrote the following:</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0"><br />

</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">&quot;A
funeral Mass will be said today for Lawrence Albert Smith, 55, a
gregarious and hard=working concessioner known to his customers as
&quot;The Great one.&quot;  He died on June 24 in his Somerville home
of heart failure.</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">According
to his wife, Sue (Rattie) smith, Mr. smith began selling popcorn and
soda pop in the stands in Boston at age 16, after he was caught by
security guards sneaking into a hockey game.</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">&quot;What
are you doing here.&quot; the security guard asked.</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">&quot;Looking
for the employment office,&quot; said Mr. Smith who was always quick
with a comeback.  Personnel agents subsequently hired him as a
vendor.</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">He
later warned  friends &quot;Don't ever sneak into a hockey game
because they'll give you a job and you'll be there for life.&quot;</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">After
working as a vendor in the stands, he sold souvenirs and other
novelties at a concession stand for 38 years at Boston Garden.  When
it closed, he sold programs at the Fleet Centre.  He is the only
concessionaire ever named to the Boston Garden Hall of Fame.</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">A
big, muscular man who was about six-feet tall and weighed more than
300 pounds, &quot;The Great One&quot; had an expansive personality. 
He was always ready to pitch in with whatever needed to be done, his
wife said, and he liked telling jokes.</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">&quot;His
customers would bring him jokes, and he liked to have new ones to
tell him every night.&quot; she said.  &quot;he was really good with
people.&quot;</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">In
addition to his wife, he leaves a son, Mark, of Springfield; three
daughters, Julie, Melissa and Stacy, all of Somerville; his sister,
Barbara Coppla, of Malden; and a  granddaughter.</p>
<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">The
funeral Mass will be said at 10:00 am at St. Ann's Church in
Somerville.  Burial will be in Holy Cross Cemetery in Malden.&quot;</p>
