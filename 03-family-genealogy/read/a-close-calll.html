  A CLOSE CALLl
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Vivid recollection of near-fatal automobile/train collision near Chatham, NB just before Christmas 1938 (year father Elmer died). Don&#x27;s brother Walter was driving Model A Ford with mother, Don, siblings Grace, Lillian (home from Boston), Kenneth, Norman. Cardboard window blocked view; train approaching from blind side. **Walter accelerated through crossing narrowly avoiding impact.** Captures moment of family danger during vulnerable period and demonstrates Don&#x27;s narrative storytelling ability.</div>

<p><b>A CLOSE CALL</b><b></b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>It was a day or two before Christmas of 1938, the year Dad died.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Grace and Venetia were married and living away; Lillian had come home from Boston where she was working.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was a crisp but clear morning; there was snow on the ground but it was well packed and not considered slippery.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Walter slid behind the wheel, Mum got in the front seat with me in the middle.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Lillian, Ken, and Norm sat in the back. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We were off to Chatham for some last minute shopping.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>John and Elinor stayed at home.<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>The window on the passenger side of the Model A had broken and was replaced temporarily with a piece of cardboard.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In those days, one always travelled via Loggieville on the way to Chatham. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>There was not much traffic on the road that morning but between Loggieville and Chatham, we caught up to our neighbours, the Adams family, in their chocolate brown truck; it was a one-ton truck with a wooden box over which a tarpaulin had been tied to protect a few passengers from the winter’s cold.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>No doubt, they were also on the way to Chatham for last minute Christmas shopping as well. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>In those days, most towns and villages of any size were served by rail – in our area, by the Canadian National Railways; Loggieville was a terminus for passengers and the point at which local farmers also picked up, among other things, their fertilizer, lime and feed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Train traffic was certainly not heavy but trains probably travelled that stretch of line 3- 4 times each day.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>From Loggieville, the train tracks followed the south side of the road and crossed to the north side just before reaching Chatham.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Christmas was always an exciting time at our house and having Lillian home, I am sure, added to our excitement.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I am sure that all in the car pitched into the conversation.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Suddenly, just as we reached the railway crossing, the sound of an approaching train and a train whistle was heard and a train was bearing down on us from the right, our blind side.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The cardboard in the window obscured our view. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Walter applied the brakes; the car kept on moving on the packed snow.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The train continued to sound its whistle and barrel down on us.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Folks on the back of the truck in front of us looked away; they thought that a crash was inevitable. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We kept sliding toward the point of inevitable impact.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Braking was not the answer.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Walter pushed the gas pedal to the floor, the car picked u speed and we crossed the tracks with the train whistling across the road behind us.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was a close call. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>A potential tragedy was narrowly avoided.</p>
