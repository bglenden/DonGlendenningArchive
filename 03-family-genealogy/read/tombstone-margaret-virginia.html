<div class="reader-summary">Correspondence (Nov 2011) between Don and St. John&#x27;s Cemetery administrator regarding restoration of his sister Margaret Virginia&#x27;s gravestone in Hampton, Virginia, buried 1918. Shows family care and connection to diaspora.</div>

<p><br></p>
<p>My father and mother, Elmer and Jane Glendenning, lived in Hampton, Virginia during the construction of the Langley Field and, in fact, had a daughter, Margaret Virginia buried in St. John’s Episcopal Cemetery. A number of family members, including myself, have visited the cemetery over the years.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>My remaining siblings are wondering if the stone still exists, what kind of shape it is in and if it could benefit from restoration.</p>
<p>Is it possible to arrange for someone to look at it and provide an estimate of the cost of cleaning and/or restoration.</p>
<p>Thanks is advance for any assistance that you can provide.</p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
<p>Don Glendenning</p>

<p>Dear Mr. Glendenning, My name is David Bishop and I am the administrator of<br>
St. John's Cemetery. I will look into this matter for you and report back<br>
to you within a week or so. (I doubt if I'll be over at the cemetery sooner<br>
than this coming Sunday.) / David Bishop</p>

&gt; Subject: Gravestone for Margaret Virginia Glendenning<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; Dear Mr. Glendenning, I visited the gravesite today. There is indeed a<br>
&gt;&gt; gravestone there but it is almost impossible to read. For your <br>
&gt;&gt; information,<br>
&gt;&gt; the gravesite is Lot 353 site a. Four infants are buried in that <br>
&gt;&gt; lot--all<br>
&gt;&gt; died in 1918. Only your sister has a gravestone. I am going to refer <br>
&gt;&gt; you<br>
&gt;&gt; to Suffolk Monument Company (Randy Maust) (757-539-6845) to obtain a<br>
&gt;&gt; professional opinion on the extent to which the gravestone can be <br>
&gt;&gt; restored.<br>
&gt;&gt; Randy has a map of our cemetery and he will be able to locate the <br>
&gt;&gt; gravesite<br>
&gt;&gt; with the lot number. If I may be of additional service to you, please <br>
&gt;&gt; let<br>
&gt;&gt; me know. /David Bishop</p>
