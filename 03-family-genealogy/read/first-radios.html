  First Radios
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Don relates his sister Lillian&#x27;s recollection that Malcolm MacNaughton owned the first radio in Black River (early listeners shared earphones), followed by Herb Fowlie and Uncle Jim Watling. Walter and Venetia (wife) purchased the first radio at Don&#x27;s home, placed in the dining room and powered by a 6-volt car battery, two B-batteries (cylindrical, 3 inches diameter), and a C-battery (soda-box sized). An aerial wire ran from the house eave to a tall pole at the gatepost near the henhouse.</div>

<p>First Radios</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>My sister, Lillian, recalled that Malcolm MacNaughton from the north side of Black River was the first one in the community to have a radio.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>People used to visit to listen and had to take turns listening through earphones.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The next two radios were Herb Fowlie and Uncle Jim Watling.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Walter and Venetia bought the first radio at my home.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It sat in the dining room near the back wall.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A copper wire was run as an aerial from the eave of the house to a tall, slender pole at the gatepost near the henhouse. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The radio was powered, as I recall by a 6-volt car battery (was that the A Battery?), two B-Batteries cylindrical and about 3 inches in diameter, and a C-battery, which was the size of a box of soda.</p>
