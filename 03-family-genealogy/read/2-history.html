<p align="center" style="font-style: normal"><b>THE
COMMUNITY </b>
</p>
<p align="center" style="font-style: normal"><br />

</p>
<p style="font-style: normal"><br />

</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal">The
name, Black River, is thought to have come from the MicMac word
Matquantigook that probably meant “black river”; the Black River,
with its tributaries principally the Little Black River but better
known as the Little Branch River, flows into Bay due Vin and the
inner Miramichi Bay.  At one time, the community of Black River
appears to have extended as far east as Bayside (Miramichi) and
perhaps as far as the Bay due Vin River.  The mouth of the Black
River, around what I knew as the Victoria Bridge and Hexham area, was
settled before 1800; most if not all the land around the Little
Branch River, except for the Fowlie Grant, and along the south side
of the Black River as far as St. Paul’s Presbyterian Church, was
granted on June 3, 1812.  
</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal"><br />

</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal">The
earliest settlers in the Black River as we know it today were United
Empire Loyalists and Highland Scots; some had settled initially along
the Saint John River, moved north to the Nashwaak and eventually
relocated to the Miramichi.  Settlers in Bay du Vin tended to be
English and followers of the Church of England with Black River being
Scottish and Presbyterian.  From MacDougall’s book we learn that
Loyalists included Major James Macdonald, Farquahar MacRae, Angus
MacDonald, Neil MacGraw, Dougald Campbell, James Gunn, Gregor
McKinnnon, Donald MacVicar, John Bailey Williston, Rev. Samuel Jones
and William Gardiner.  From Scotland came the Cameron brothers, John
MacLean, Hugh MacDougall, the MacNaughton family and William
MacBeath.  To our lists we must add Peter Kelly who came from
Ireland, the MacLeods, Sinclairs, Fraser, etc  and many other early
settlers but not included in MacDougall’s book.  Many residents of
the same name can still be found in the community today</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal"><br />

</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal">The
land was heavily wooded, winters were long and cold and life was
hard.  But pioneers were hardy folk who were determined to carve out
a new life for themselves, their families and their offspring.  These
settlers brought crude axes, shovels and other implements to clear
land, plant crops and build homes.  And they also brought their
religion – mostly Presbyterian.</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal"><br />

</p>
<h1>THE FIRST CHURCH</h1>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal"><br />

</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal"><br />

</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal">At
first the settlement was served by itinerant ministers and
missionaries.  Among the visiting ministers was the Rev. Dr. James
Drummond MacGregor, a Scot who had been sent out to minister to the
Presbyterians in Pictou, Nova Scotia.  In addition to serving the
folk of Pictou, MacGregor traveled throughout New Brunswick, Nova
Scotia and Prince Edward Island.  Each visit to a community usually
lasted several days, and even weeks, and included preaching, praying,
and religious conversations.   The <u>Memoir of Rev. James MacGregor,</u>
D.D. written by his Grandson, Rev. George Patterson, recounts
MacGregor’s visit to Black River (p.316) as follows:</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal"><br />

</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 0.5in; font-style: normal">
“<i>On the first and second visits to the Miramichi in 1797 and
1807, he preached and baptized at Black River, Bay du Vin, and on
both sides of the Miramichi, up as far as the point, so called, at
the junction of the North and South-west branches.  Those who
recollect him remark his happy faculty in introducing religious
conversation.”</i></p>
<p align="justify"><br />

</p>
<p align="justify"><br />

</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal"><br />

</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal"><br />

</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal">And
further on:</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal"><br />

</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 0.5in">“His
being present at the induction of Mr. Thompson in 1817 is well
remembered.”</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal"><br />

</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal">A. W.
MacDougall reports that a Rev. Jones resided in Bay du Vin but his
religious affiliation is not known.</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal"><br />

</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal">In
1812, a church, thought to be Presbyterian, was built in at Tuckers
Point, at the mouth and on the west side of the Bay du Vin River. 
(While Tucker’s Point was used in conversation by several people,
the name does not appear in <u>Geographical Names of New Brunswick</u>
by Rayburn, 1975.)  Some gravestones are still to be found in the
area.  The church served all Protestants in the area.  A. W.
MacDougall reported that a contract for the building of the church
was in the possession of a “gentleman in Bay du Vin” and that the
document: 
</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal"><br />

</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 0.5in">“ bore the signature
of the contractor, a Mr. Gray of Chatham, and also the names of three
men representing the people, John B. Williston, Farquhar MacRae and a
Mr. McLeod.  Mr. Williston lived in Bay du Vin, Mr. McRae in Bay
Side, and Mr. McLeod in Black River.</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 0.5in"><br />

</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 0.5in"><i>The
church was a small building of frame construction, and was built
close to the shore on the westerly side of the south of Bay du Vin
River, at a spot since known as ‘Ullock’s Point’, from the name
of the man who owned the surrounding land, and where a ferry
connected with the other side of the river.  It was used for public
worship as occasion required until the building of the first church
on the site at Black River, and then fell into disuse…</i></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 0.5in"><br />

</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 0.5in; font-style: normal">
<i>A small plot of land adjoining the church was used as a cemetery,
and a considerable number of people were interred there.”</i></p>
<p align="justify"><br />

<h1> ST STEPHEN’S PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH</h1>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal"><br />

</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal">Given
that Black River was founded by Scots, a growing community and that
most of the Presbyterians lived several miles from Tucker’s Point,
a community of people who worshipped mostly in the English tradition,
it is not surprising that talk soon turned, first to finding a
Presbyterian minister and later to constructing a place of worship. 
A. W. MacDougall reports that a public meeting was held in Bay du Vin
in 1818 with a view to securing a resident minister to serve Bay du
Vin, Tabusintac and Burnt Church - a minister who could speak in
Gaelic as well as English since “there are several amongst us who
do not understand the English”.

Presbyterian Church in Black River (1834)</b></p>
<p align="center" style="font-style: normal"><b>(Source

<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal"><br />

</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal">In
1834, a public meeting was held in Black River at which it was
decided to petition for a minister to serve both Black River and
Tabusintac.  In response to the request, the Rev. Simon Fraser was
dispatched to serve their needs.  I do not know if the Rev. Fraser
initially served both Black River and Bay du Vin but it appears that
shortly thereafter he became the minister for Black River only.  
</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal"><br />

</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal">On
November 10, 1834 a meeting was held in Black River at the residence
of Mr. Archibald Cameron and a committee was commission to proceed
with the erection of a church.  The site for the church was Gunn’s
Point, already being used as a burial ground, part of Lot #4 granted
to Alexander Gunn on June 3, 1812.   By then, the land was owned by
Enoch Godfrey who gave or sold an acre for the new church.   Church
building committee members were:</p>

<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal"><br />

</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal">W.
MacDougall describes Gunn’s Point (part of Lot #4 granted to
Alexander Gunn on June 3, 1812) as follows:</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal"><br />

</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 0.5in">“The
proposed site for the church, which has long been known as Church
Point, is a peninsula several acres in extent, jutting out from the
mainland on the South Side of the Black River about three miles from
its mouth, and connected to the shore by a narrow neck of land.  It
has dry sandy soil, and at that time was partly covered with a heavy
growth of timber.  It is an ideal location for a church, probably
without parallel in the whole Province.  A portion of it had
previously been used as a burial ground, and there it was decided to
build the church.”</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal"><br />

</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal">On
April 21, 1835 a contract was awarded to William Porteous to erect
the church; structural timber was cut locally.  The building was 45
feet long by 30 feet wide with an 18-foot wall.  On November 20,
1836, the first house of worship, St Stephen’s Presbyterian Church,
was formally opened with the Rev. Mr. Fraser as its first minister.</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal"><br />

</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal">In the
years that followed, St. Stephens Church was beset by two major
problems. The financial problems resulted from the costs of
construction and the also the cost of ongoing operations.  (This is
still a challenge to churches in the 21<sup>st</sup> century.)</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal"><br />

</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal"> By the
turn of the century, St. Stephen’s sanctuary had become quite
dilapidated and, instead of making repairs, a decision was taken to
build a new sanctuary.  The result was the opening of St. Stephen’s
Presbyterian Church, now St. Stephen’s United Church, on December
30, 1906.</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal"><br />

</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal">Church
differences in Scotland were transported to Canada and resulted in
tensions within St. Stephens Presbyterian Church in Black River.  The

</p>
<h1>CHURCH UNION</h1>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal"><br />

</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal">Divisions
within the Presbyterian Church in Scotland, it seems, went on
forever.  Most resulted from differing views as to the proper or
acceptable relationship between church and state.  Scots were not
prepared to accept a state church, as was the case in England. 
Perhaps another cause for dissension was the strong view that no
minister or church hierarchy should stand between a person and
his/her God.   Then there was the issue of churches being able to
appoint their own minister rather than have a minister appointed by
the land owner or proprietor or some church body.  By 1843 there were
four different Presbyterian churches in Scotland – and Scots
brought their differing views with them when they came to Canada. 
The early mid -1800’s witnessed a movement towards unification
among a number of Presbyterian denominations that resulted, by 1875,
in the creation of the Presbyterian Church in Canada - and
discussions with other Presbyterians continued.</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal"><br />

</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal">Other
denominations were coming together as well.  Union within the
Methodist denomination was achieved by 1884 and within the
Congregationalist churches by 1906.  The Church of England, as early
as 1836, had appointed a committee to explore possible union with
like-minded denominations.  Talk of further unification, therefore,
was not unexpected.  In fact, at the inception of the Presbyterian
Church in Canada, Dr. John Cook, the Moderator, said,  “far larger
union is in store”.  Others expressed similar sentiments.  A
federation of denominations was also considered an option.</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal"><br />

</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal">While
discussions were going on, a number of churches cooperated in the
Sunday School Association of Canada, Temperance Movement, Evangelical
Alliance, etc.; this helped to break down other denominational
barriers.  There was even a sharing of social services between
congregations, cooperation in the training of clergy and a wider
discussion of matters theological.  
</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal"><br />

</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal">In the
late 1800’s, multi-party discussions were held within the
Presbyterian family and among Presbyterians, Methodists,
Congregationalists and the Church of England with a view to bringing
all together into a single Protestant denomination.  Based on my
reading, it appears to have been clergy led and clumsily executed.  
</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal"><br />

</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal">By 1904
discussions were well under way towards an organic union among
Protestant denominations led by a joint committee representing the
Presbyterians, Methodist and Congregational denominations.   The
report to the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church concluded
that the process should not be unduly hurried, should carry the
consent of the entire membership and should not be contemplated until
all the courts of the church had a chance to consider it.  “Consent
of the entire membership” and concerns about an unclear doctrinal
statement for the new church appear to be the major points of
dissention over the next two decades.  In 1906 invitations to
participate in discussions were issued to the Church of England and
Baptist conventions but these invitations were declined.  By 1912,
those against union had begun to coalesce and organize.  While votes
at Presbytery, Synod and General Assembly levels continued to favour
union; numbers against union at the congregational level continued to
grow.  Support for union was strongest among clergy and leadership
moved to the courts of the church rather than remaining with members
and adherents. 
</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal"><br />

</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal">Church
Union occurred before my time, however, the event was recent enough
that I was witness to some of the fall-out.  I’ve since read and
talked to a few people better versed than I on the subject.  The main
points of contention seemed centre on:</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal"><br />

</p>
<ul>
	<li><p align="justify" style="font-style: normal">the
	disappearance of the name Presbyterian.  
	</p></li>
	<li><p align="justify" style="font-style: normal">doctrinal
	changes</p></li>
	<li><p align="justify" style="font-style: normal">level
	of support required to warrant such a momentus change, and</p></li>
	<li><p align="justify" style="font-style: normal">perception
	that union was the first step towards a “state  church” 
	</p></li>
</ul>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal"><br />

</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal">Decisions
on church union were taken by each congregation.  Tabulated
nationally, the 1925 voting results were:</p>
<p style="font-style: normal"><br />

</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; font-style: normal">Votes
cast in favour		121,547</p>

<p style="font-style: normal"><br />

</p>
<p style="font-style: normal">In the Maritime Synod,
18,883 voted in favour of union and 13,743 voted against.</p>
<p style="font-style: normal"><br />

</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal">Of the
4,981 members of the Miramichi Presbytery in 1925, 2,011 voted in
favour of union and 647 voted against union with 2.323 not voting. 
Figures for St. Stephens Church are not available, however, the
majority favoured union and St. Stephens Presbyterian Church became
St. Stephens United Church.</p>

<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal"><br />

</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal">As a
result of the vote, Presbyterians in Black River lost their sanctuary
but not their denomination nor their tradition.  Presbyterians
continued to worship as members of St. Stephen’s Presbyterian
Church as late as September 30, 1928 and perhaps until  the new
Presbyterian church opened in 1930.  Services were held in the Little
Branch School, the Upper Black River School and in members’ homes
being led by visiting ministers, congregational leaders and student
ministers.  Although formal records are scanty, records show that in
1926 there was an active Women’s Missionary Society, a Women’s
League, Mission Band and Sunday School.  Also in 1926, the first
baptisms (Kenneth Glendenning, Norman Glendenning and Roy Watling)
were conducted on June 14 by Rev. F. G. MacIntosh.  A Presbyterian
Young People’s Society was formed in 1930 with Venetia
(Glendenning) Russell as the first President.</p>

Total cost of the new building was $3,000; wages for labor at the
time was $2.00 per day.  The pulpit and pews were purchased from the
former Methodist church in Chatham.

<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal">During
a search at the Registry Office in Newcastle a number of years ago, I
came across a record, No.226, dated November 9, 1944, showing the
discharge of a mortgage against James A. Watling, Elmer Glendenning,
John E. MacNaughton, John R. Gibson and John L. R. Godfrey.  The
other parties to the agreement were Ernest William McNeill and John
Forbes Michie of the City of Toronto.   The amount is not given but
the date of the original mortgage agreement was April 23, 1931.   I
believe this to be the mortgage for St. Paul’s church.</p>

<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal">On
Friday, July 18, 1930, the 34<sup>th</sup> annual Miramichi
Presbyterial met in the new facility.  Activities included a morning
session, lunch served by the ladies of Black River, a missionary
pageant and service in the afternoon.  
</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal"><br />

</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal">The
evening included a pageant presented by the Chatham PYPS,
installation of officers, remarks by Dr. Squires, Minister of the
Presbyterian Church in Chatham and by Mr. James A. Watling, the
Representative Elder.  A formal service of dedication was held at
8:00 pm chaired by Rev. J. W. Paul of Bathurst, Moderator and Clerk
of Presbytery.  Presbyterians in Black River now had their own
sanctuary again. Newspaper report of dedication
referred to the ‘dedication of the building, which is to be known
as St. Paul’s Presbyterian Church”</p>

</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal">A
clipping from the local paper, unnamed and undated, describes the new
building as follows:</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 0.5in">“The new church is
completed and ready for opening.  A fine and beautiful edifice it is
– a credit to any community.  In these days when any kind of a
building may pass for a church, it can be truly said that the
structure in Black River reflects the ideal eclesiastical
architecture for a small house of worship.  The church has evoked
nothing but praise from all who have seen it.  Great appreciation is
expressed to all who worked to make it what it is – to the building
committee, to the carpenters in charge and others who have laboured
without stint.”</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 0.5in"><br />

</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal">In late
1930, discussions were held with Presbyterian congregations in both
Kouchibouguac and Richibucto with a view to sharing the services of a
full-time minister.  As a result, Knox Presbyterian Church,
Kouchibouguac and St. Paul’s became a two-point charge.  In 1950,
Calvin Presbyterian Church began to share a minister with St. Paul's
and Knox – an arrangement that continues to this day.</p>

<h5 align="center">BLACK RIVER CEMETERY</h5>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal"><br />

</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal">The
writer is not unaware of the tension within the congregation at the
time, and within church families, with events surrounding Church
Union; some may still exist.  Perhaps the outstanding issue is that
of the cemetery.  Even today, road signs point to both the Black
River Cemetery and St. Stephens Cemetery yet they are one and the
same.    
</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal"><br />

</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal">As
mentioned earlier, there was a burial ground beside the church in Bay
due Vin.  As early as 1823, however, the first burial took place on
the present burial site in Black River.  The original land on which
the church and cemetery are located, Lot Number 4, was granted to
Alexander Gunn on June 3, 1812.  The area on which the church and
cemetery are located was known as Gunn’s Point; later ownership of
the land passed to Enoch Godfrey.  In the history of St. Stephens,
Ernest MacLean reported the first burial in 1823 of Enoch’s
father-in-law, Robert MacBeath; the second burial, a year later, was
Duncan MacNaughton who was killed by a falling log.  Perhaps this was
the origin of the “Black River Cemetery” to distinguish it from
the one in use in Bay due Vin.  In any case, according to my
information, St. Stephen’s Presbyterian Church purchased the land
in 1836 at the time that the new church was erected in Black River. 
The name, Church Point, which applies to the location at present,
probably arises from that time.</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal"><br />

</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal">A
search of church records may throw more light on the issue of
cemetery name.  Was it St. Stephens Cemetery?  Or St. Stephens
Presbyterian Cemetery?  Again in 1925, did the name remain as St.
Stephens Cemetery or was it formally changed to St. Stephens United
Church Cemetery.  I leave it to others to sort out this issue.  In
any case, in 1940, the congregation of St. Stephens United Church
passed a resolution granting Presbyterians the same rights and
privileges as to the use of the cemetery as they had before church
union and invited St. Paul’s congregation to name a member to the
Cemetery Committee.  The Presbyterians accepted the offer and decided
that a separate Presbyterian cemetery was not needed.</p>
