<p>Date:		 TIME \@ "MMMM d, yyyy" May 22, 2005</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>To:		Bruce</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>From:		Don</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Greetings from PEI.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>As discussed, here are a few notes as background to your project:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Christina Catherine Watling (1876-1956) was the first born of Jubal and Grace (MacDonald) Watling.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>On August 17, 1895, she married Robert Thomas Adams.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They had three children of which James Irenus was the oldest.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Robert Thomas Adams died in 1902.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I am not sure where they lived originally, but family lore says that “Uncle Tom Adams” was ill for an extended period of time and the family moved in with, and later died at the home of, his wife’s parents who were living at Little Branch.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A number of Aunt Tine’s younger siblings would be living in the home at the same time (Janet, Ern, Jane, Jim and maybe others).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Jimmie Adams would be more like a sibling than a nephew.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Aunt Tine may have lived at the Watling home until she remarried in August 1907.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If so, Jimmie would have been part of the family for a period of at least 5 and maybe even 7 years.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>During this period, Jubal was postmaster and family lore sys that Aunt Tine operated the post office for him.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Marjorie Young even mentioned it on my recent trip to the Miramichi.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Aunt Tine and John MacKenzie moved to Loggieville, about 11 miles away, and would have been living there when Jimmie enlisted in the army.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Janet Watling (1883-1977) lived and worked for a while in Waltham, Mass.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>On February 1, 1913 she married John R. Godfrey and they continued to live in Back River about 3-4 miles from the family home..</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Jane Watling went to Portland in 1908 and married Elmer Glendenning on October 10, 1910 and lived and worked in the USA.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In 1914 they returned to NB and bought the property directly across the road from the old family home departing for the USA again in late 1916. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Ernest Watling was probably living at home when he enlisted.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>All of the above would have been aunts and uncles to Jimmie.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Archie MacNaughton (1896-1944) lived about 4 miles further up river and would not have gone to the same school as Ernest and Jimmie.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Jim Palmer lived across the river and would not have attended the same school as those mentioned above.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He would be a neighbour of Janet (Watling) Godfrey.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Walter MacDonald lived across the Little Branch River from the Watlings, about 2 miles distant, and would have attended the same school.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>In the letter dated Oct 21, 1916: (a) Mother and father had just moved from Black River to Connecticut, They had been living across from the family home for a two year period – 1914-1916, (b) I am not sure who Margaret was, (c) Grace is my oldest sister who was born in 1911 and she went to school in Connecticut, (d) Walter is my brother who was born in 1913.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Their home was on a hill so they could see Jim coming either on foot or by horse,, (e) Jims Grandfather, Jubal Watling, died in 1915 and one of Ern’s brothers came back to run the farm.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>(f) Belle refers to Isabel MacDonald, a first cousin of Jimmie’s mother and lived less than a half mile away.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>(g) Hexham is about a mile away and would have a different Post Office. (h) George I expect would be Jim’s uncle, Ern’s brother (i) Jane is my mother <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>All would have gone to the same church</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Enclosed is (a) a photocopy of a post card from Uncle Ern to my mother, (b) a photocopy of a post card to my sister, Grace, from my father’s brother, Guy, while overseas, (c) a photocopy of a letter to Jimmie’s mother from my father’s brother, Guy Glendenning.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>and (d) a letter from Guy Glendenning to his brother, my father.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>John Archibald Mills, also called Archie, (794113) was killed on April 9, 1917 and is buried at Nine Elms Military Cemetery in France.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I do not know much about him but apparently he was serving with the 42<sup>nd</sup> Battalion.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He lived in Hardwicke, a few miles of east of the Watling home, but had relatives in the area.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>His mother was a MacNaughton and his sister was Mrs. James A. Watling was Jimmie’s aunt by marriage.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Trust that these are helpful.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If these notes do not totally confuse you, let me know and I will try again.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Let me know if I can help,</p>
