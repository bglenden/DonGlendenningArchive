<p>Hi Don;</p>
<p>You have had  a busy winter,111,112 and 113 very interesting,especially info,re Miramichi Regional High Busses etc.Sister Marg attended in those early days .She boarded one winter in Bayside then moved to Chatham,and lived with Uncle Douglas McLeod for the remainder .I was amazed to read The Godfrey busses only began in 1944,this was certainly a great service to the Comunities of Miramichi Bay.</p>
<p>BABBET-now  here is something I know about in spite of my non-mechanical mind .My Dear Father did explain the bacics of the small gas motors to me and a few things sank in.The small marine motor(Atlantic by name) 10 HP two cylinder which was the Power in THE M.H.L.(my dads old boat).This old motor had 4 of these bearings.The pouring of these bearings was a very delicate exercise,and required the expert hands of Cousin  Alexander Mills (Son of Andrew of BayDuVin beach,)These bearings were made of Babbet.The bearinga were poured then filed to smoth the surface ,it took days.Even Enid the old farmer had not herd of Babbet.</p>
<p>By the way among my treasures I found some MRHS patches for the Hockey team1950-Softball team 1949,this would be in Raymond Legers years.</p>
<p>Thanks for the memories,best wishes to you and Carol</p>
