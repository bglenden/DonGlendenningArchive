  Canobie Connection
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Genealogical and historical documentation of Glendenning family connection to Canobie, NB area. Opens with statement: John Glendinning (Elmer&#x27;s father) settled Bathurst area ~1830, later moved to Canobie where Elmer was born. Documents place names along coastal route east from Bathurst: Salmon Beach (1820 Irish settlers), Janeville (named Jane Dawson), Stonehaven (possibly Scottish origin), New Bandon (1819 Irish settlers), Canobie (named after Canonbie, Dumfriesshire, Scotland). Provides historical context on settlement patterns (1700s Acadian settlement, organized land granting from 1800s). Details John Glendinning Sr. (Elmer&#x27;s grandfather): born April 2, 1807 at Callister Hall, Dumfriesshire, Scotland; sailed from Annan 1830; purchased Lot 7 Salmon Beach with Margaret Harley (married August 23, 1833); Margaret taught first school in Salmon Beach (home-based 1838, purpose-built 1842; 27 students, 12x12x6 feet schoolhouse). Describes property movements: John and Margaret moved inland to Canobie 1855, sold Salmon Beach property. Lists early Canobie land grants (100-acre lots) with names and dates (1868-1939). Census records from 1861/1871 showing household composition. Children: Mary Anne, John, Margaret, Elizabeth Jane, Walter. John Sr. died May 15, 1877 in Canobie; Margaret died October 21, 1895. Extensive section on John Jr. (married Ellen Dickey; children practically raised by brother Walter&#x27;s family), burial New Bandon Cemetery. Details Walter Glendenning (grandfather): born November 26, 1845; married Elizabeth Peters (daughter of John Peters, October 23, 1821-June 31, 1904, and Jane Sealy, December 24, 1821-September 12, 1892). Walter active in church (Sunday School teacher), Trinity Union Church trustee (1899), cut first lumber for building. Successful farmer with documented property holdings (Lot 30 Canobie homestead, 100-acre Lot 28, Stevens Farm 100 acres, Taylor Farm 50 acres). Will inventory lists extensive livestock and equipment (horses, cows, sheep, bull, farm machinery). Walter died of pneumonia while visiting daughter Venetia in Falmouth Foreside, Maine (will January 6, 1908, death February 1908); Elizabeth relocated to Maine, died May 14, 1915. Burial in Presbyterian cemetery New Bandon. References FWH manuscript &quot;Boyhood Memories of New Brunswick&quot; (~1940) with anecdotes about Canobie neighbors and family connections. Establishes genealogical continuity from John Sr. through Elmer&#x27;s generation.</div>

<p align="left">John
Glendinning, my Great Grandfather settled in the Bathurst area about
1830; later he moved to Canobie where my father, Elmer Glendenning
was born.  This chapter deals with the Canobie connection to the
Glendenning family.</p>

</p>
<p align="left"><b>Early
Names</b></p>
<p align="left"><br />

</p>
<p align="left">Travelling
east from Bathurst along the coast towards Caraquet, one finds a
number of communities familiar to the Glendenning family.  The
following information was taken from Geographical Names of New
Brunswick, 1875.  
</p>
<p align="left"><br />

</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-left: 1in; text-indent: -0.5in">
<b>Bathurst</b>,
originally named St. Peters in 1671, was named for the Third Earl of
Bathurst in 1826. 
</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-left: 0.44in; text-indent: -0.5in">
 <b>	</b></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-left: 0.94in; text-indent: -0.5in">
<b>Salmon
Beach</b>
was settled around 1820 by immigrants from Ireland and included the
districts of Prospect Hill, Strawberry Plain and Mount Pleasant.  
</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-left: 0.94in; text-indent: -0.5in">
<b>Janeville</b>
was named for Jane Dawson, wife of Benjamin Dawson who settled there
about 1835.  
</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-left: -0.06in; text-indent: 0.5in">
<b>Stonehaven</b>
was probably named for Stonehaven, Scotland. <b>
</b>
</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-left: -0.06in; text-indent: 0.5in">
<b>New
Bandon</b>
was settled in 1819 by several families from Bandon, Ireland.</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-left: -0.06in"><br />

</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-left: -0.06in"><br />

</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-left: 1.94in; text-indent: -2in">
If
one turns inland along the Janeville Road one comes to <b>Canobie
</b>which
was named</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-left: 1.94in; text-indent: -2in">
 after
Canonbie, Dumfriesshire, Scotland.  <b>	</b></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-left: -0.06in"><br />

</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-left: -0.06in">According
to  Pioneer Settlers of the Bay Chaleur. Settlement on the coast east
of Bathurst took place by the Acadians in the latter half of the
1700s and, although living on the land, their grants were not given
until 1812.  The first registered land grant was to James Sutherland
and his brother Hugh, and Richard Nevison in 1789.  <b>
</b>Apparently,
an organized system of granting of land did not evolve until the
1800s and even then there could be delays of a decade or more between
petitioning for land and receiving it.  Even then, the grant was not
final until at least five acres had been cleared.  
</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-left: -0.06in"><br />

</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-left: -0.06in">Once
settled, men began the task of clearing land and erecting a dwelling
and barn.  Trees not needed were stacked, dried and burned.  Few oxen
or horses were available so the land was broken and cultivated with
the aid of a hoe.  The initial crops were planted between the stumps,
which, over time, rotted and were removed.  In many cases, the
initial seeds came with the settler from the old country.</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-left: -0.06in"><br />

</p>
<div id="Section1" dir="ltr"><p align="left">Immigrants
	came by boat to Bathurst, Pokeshaw, Bass River and Caraquet.  Others
	came to Saint John, Miramichi or even Halifax and changed ships or
	even walked through to the Bathurst area.  (Maryanne Harley, as
	reported earlier, landed in Pokeshaw and walked through to Newcastle
	where her brother was living at the time.)  One might wonder why
	immigrants landed at Pokeshaw.  The Bay Chaleur history records that
	Pokeshaw had a secure harbour, was an active fishing centre.  As
	early as 1812, 30 acres of land had been cleared and had a number of
	houses constructed.  Sailing vessels stopped there for water and
	supplies including fresh meat.

	<p align="left"><br />

	<p align="left"><br />

	<p align="left"><b>John
	Glendinning</b></p>
	<p align="left"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="left">Into
	Salmon Beach on or about 1830 came John Glendinning.<b>
	 </b>We
	do not know<b>
	</b>exactly
	when he arrived or how he got there.  Around the same time period,
	there were a number of Glendennings who arrived from the Dumfries
	area of Scotland and settled in the Saint John area; some moved
	later to Nova Scotia.  According to Pioneer Settlers, John
	Glendinning, Sr. is believed to have purchased part of Lot No. 7 at
	Salmon Beach from Fidele and Joseph Arceneau</p>
	<p align="left"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="left"><b>John
	and Margaret (Harley) Glendinning (Great-grandparents)</b></p>
	<p align="left"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="left">John
	Glendinning, my great-grandfather, was born on April 2, 1807, at
	Callister Hall, Parish of Middlebie, Dumfriesshire, Scotland. He was
	baptized on July 10, 1808</p>
	<p align="left"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="left">In
	1830, he sailed from Annan, a seaport on the south coast of
	Scotland.  This would be the nearest port to where he was born. It
	is likely, although we have no record that he landed at Pokeshaw on
	the Bay Chaleur near Bathurst, New Brunswick, as Pokeshaw was a busy
	seaport and sailing ships seemed to be a regular stop from overseas.
	 According to Pioneer Settlers of the Bay Chaleur, he purchased part
	of Lot 7 at Salmon Beach which was between Pokeshaw and Bathurst. On
	August 23, 1833, he married Margaret Harley who had come from
	Ireland to New Brunswick to join other family members.  
	</p>
	<p align="left"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="left">Margaret
	Glendinning was a schoolteacher and the first school in Salmon Beach
	was opened in her home in 1838.  By 1842 a new school was opened at
	Upper Salmon Beach.  The school measure 12 feet by 12 feet by 6 feet
	and housed 27 pupils.  School reports of the time (1842, I believe)
	reported that:</p>
	<p align="left"><br />

	</p>
	<ul>
		<li><p align="left">her
		original license was issued in 1838</p></li>
		<li><p align="left">her
		first school was in her own home; later she taught in the new
		school erected before 1842</p></li>
		<li><p align="left">summer
		attendance averaged 27; winter attendance averaged 22</p></li>
		<li><p align="left">instruction
		emphasized reading, writing and arithmetic</p></li>
		<li><p align="left">Margaret
		listed herself as Church of England</p></li>
		<li><p align="left">She
		taught school for at least six years</p></li>
		<li><p align="left">the
		new school measured 12 ft. By 12 ft. By 6 ft.</p></li>
		<li><p align="left">furniture
		consisted of a small table and benches</p></li>
		<li><p align="left">girls
		were taught sewing</p></li>
	</ul>
	<p align="left"><br />

	</p>
</div>
<div id="Section2" dir="ltr"><p align="left">According
	to the Bay Chaleur history, settlers raised sheep, carded and spun
	wool and wove cloth.  John Glendinning, presumably the Senior John,
	owned one of the first weaving machines in Canobie and taught others
	in the community to weave.  I recall my mother saying that
	Grandmother Glendenning possessed a shuttle.  Apparently, the
	shuttle passed to Aunt Venetia Doring and from her to Cornelia
	Farrell.</p>
	<p align="left"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="left">According
	to Pioneer Settlers, John and Margaret sold their land in 1855 to
	Abram Buttimer and moved inland to Canobie.  We do not know the
	reason for moving but we do know that waterfront land at Salmon
	Beach took a heavy beating and some flooding from storms.  Also with
	a growing family and cheap land he may have felt that he would give
	his family a better start in Canobie.</p>

	When the grants were made, however, they were in the names of his
	sons, John and Walter.  He and his family may have been living on
	the lot since it was not unusual for early settlers to live on land
	for a number of years before receiving title; they may have even
	been required to clear a number of acres and even build a house.</p>

	Anglicans.  (It is now an Anglican Church).  Walter is reported to
	have been one of the first trustees and, according to the Chaleur

	written by FWH about 1940.  It is a typewritten manuscript rather
	than a book and is about his boyhood memories in Canobie.  Among
	other things, he mentions:</p>
	<p align="justify" style="orphans: 2; widows: 2"><br />

	</p>
	<ol>
		<li><p align="justify" style="widows: 2; orphans: 2">an

		<li><p align="justify" style="widows: 2; orphans: 2">he
		was born in Clifton, near the stone quarry.</p></li>
		<li><p align="justify" style="widows: 2; orphans: 2">his
		grandparents lived in Newcastle during the Miramichi Fire (1825)</p></li>
		<li><p align="justify" style="widows: 2; orphans: 2">Tim
		Savage, a near neighbour.  (Lot # 27 in Canobie was owned by Tim
		Savage.)</p></li>
		<li><p align="justify" style="widows: 2; orphans: 2">his

	<p align="justify" style="orphans: 2; widows: 2">He
	also tells a ghost story based at a camp in the woods just south of
	Bathurst on the Red Pine Section of the  Intercolonial Railroad. 
	From what he said, his mother was at that camp.  He ends his
	manuscript with his departure from Bathurst for Maine.</p>
	<p align="justify" style="orphans: 2; widows: 2"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify" style="orphans: 2; widows: 2">It
	is likely that he was a Henry, grandson of Mary Anne Harley and John
	Henry.  I do not have the names of many of her family but understand
	that her husband, John, died in 1870 and she moved to Portland
	shortly thereafter.  My records also show that one of Mary Anne’s
	daughters married a Knowles and another married a Stevens</p>
