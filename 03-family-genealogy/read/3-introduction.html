<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>INTRODUCTION</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>My father and mother came from large and close families; visits and visitors were frequent and family ties were emphasized and strong.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>At an early age, I became intrigued by the number of neighbours along the length of the Black River to whom I was related.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>By the late 1940’s I began gathering information about my ancestors. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Information was drawn from many sources with the Glendenning Family Bible in my Mother’s possession being my entry point into the field.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Shortly thereafter, I conducted a survey on my father’s side of the family.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>By then, I was hooked although my information gathering was sporadic, at best.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The benefit of computer based technology and a new spurt of information gathering after retirement resulted in a cabinet full of files, scraps of paper on every flat surface in my basement and a database containing nearly 4,000 names.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The conclusion reached as a youngster in Black River has been borne out; at that time I was related to most people in the community.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>My focus has been broad rather than narrow.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>By that, I mean, I am interested in the broad picture of who I am rather than pursuing only my Glendenning roots.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As a result, I have since learned that, in addition to my Glendenning ancestry, I am also a descendant of folks named Peters, Sealey, Harley, Bidders, Beattie, Rae, MacDonald, Watling, MacAskill, MacNaughton, Leach and Jardine.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And if I were to reach back further, I would find other ancestors as well. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>This document does not pretend to be a history of the family; instead, it is a record of what I learned during my search; a history would be more thorough and complete.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If a lead interested me I followed it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As a result the amount of information on each individual or family varies greatly. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I believe the included information to be accurate but I am sure that there are mistakes; if I knew what the mistakes were, I would have corrected them.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When in doubt, I prefaced my remarks with “I think” or “it is likely” or a similar statement.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I welcome corrections and additions.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Together we can continue to grow the record.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Unfortunately, it is only with recent information that I have been attributing sources. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span></p>
<p>Among other things, I’ve reviewed books, searched through newspapers, undertaken an occasional Internet search, gathered census data and reviewed church and cemetery documents. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I’ve also spent hours pestering family and friends and steering conversations to reveal additional information.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Most, but certainly not all, of the photos came from two collections, one belonging to my mother, Jane (Watling) Glendenning and the other to my sister, Venetia (Glendenning) Russell. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Other photos came from a variety of sources. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Some of the information in this document has already appeared in versions distributed to siblings.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Other information appeared in occasional newsletters, the <span>Family Chronicle</span>, now available, thanks to my son, Brian, on the family Website<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>HYPERLINK "http://www.glendenning.net/don" <span>www.glendenning.net/don</span> <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>One of the most enlightening experiences to was to develop both a Watling and a Glendenning chart each 10 to fifteen feet long; these charts certainly provided a tremendous insight into the family relationships in the community of Black River.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The task is not complete; it never will be finished.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is time, however, to consolidate that which I have learned and publish it for the benefit of others. It is my hope that readers will find the document of interest but, even more important, I hope that others will pick the search and extend the knowledge of both the extend family and the community.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I also want to pursue some other interests.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Having said that, however, I plan to continue to fit in pieces as I find them.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I want to thank all who contributed either knowingly or unknowingly to this compendium.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My Mother was the first source but all my siblings contributed along the way.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Clifton Watling, gave me access to his family information, George Watling responded to many questions, relatives in the Bathurst area, Art Mills, my internet family and friends.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>For the last wave of information gathering and interpretation, I am especially indebted to my siblings, Walter, Venetia, Lillian, Kenneth and Norman.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>People interested in genealogy are both interesting and generous; among those I thank library staff in Wauchula, Florida, Portland, Maine, Long Island and Hampton Virginia, respondents to my letters placed in the Portland and New Brunswick papers.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The list of my indebtedness is a long one.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Finally, I must point out that this document entailed a considerable commitment of time that really should have been allotted to my wife and family.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Thanks. Carol, Brian and Janet, Marie, Lisa and Laura.</p>
