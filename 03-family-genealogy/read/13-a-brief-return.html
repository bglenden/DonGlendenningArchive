<p><b>REESTABLISHING ROOTS IN NEW BRUNSW3ICK</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Back to New Brunswick</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>We do not know exactly when Mum and Dad returned to New Brunswick but here are a few facts:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Elmer and Jane set up housekeeping in Parksville, Tennessee on February 11, 1911.</p>
<p>Their first child, Grace, was born in Parksville, Tennessee on September 23, 1911.</p>
<p>Jessie MacDonald died in April, 1912.</p>
<p>A number of entries in Mum’s autograph album, the last on November 13, 1912, show they were still in Parksville at that time. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Entries in Mum's autograph album by her brother, Ernest, and another from "Hughy", her cousin, “Mac” MacDonald,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>dated November 13, 1912, indicates that either she and/or they were about to leave Parksville.</p>
<p>The Parksville dam was completed in December of 1912; a new dam was built up the Ocooe<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>River near Goforth Creek in 1913.</p>
<p>The second dam had the flume line which we know that Dad worked on.</p>
<p>A reference in Mum’s record book shows them living at Goforth Creek in 1913.</p>
<p>Mum was back in New Brunswick when Walter was born in on September 29, 1913.</p>
<p>Dad purchased the Jessie MacDonald property on July 21, 1914.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Elmer Glendenning was listed by Canada Post as being Postmaster at Little Branch from November 1, 1914 to August 1, 1916. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Venetia was born in New Brunswick on May 15, 1915. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Lillian was born in North Haven, Connecticut on January 8, 1917.</p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>My scenario is that Dad and mother moved from Parksville to Goforth Creek at the end of 1912.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In the summer of 1913, Mum returned with the children to Little Branch.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Dad may or may not have accompanied her but he came sometime that fall or winter.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They stayed at Little Branch until late 1916 and then moved to North Hampton, Connecticut where Lillian was born on January 8, 1917.</p>
