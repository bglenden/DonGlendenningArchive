  Edge-Outhouse
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Written by Donald Edge (NOT Don Glendenning; received as email correspondence Feb 2003), this witty and detailed essay describes life in Black River using outdoor privies and chamber pots, drawing from childhood memories and observations. References Don&#x27;s Watling cousins and their remarkably modern indoor privy within their barn complex. A valuable resource for understanding the material conditions of early 20th-century Black River life and provides context for Don&#x27;s own childhood experiences in that community. Edge&#x27;s piece reflects on outhouses as &quot;hallmarks of democracy&quot; and symbols of self-reliance.</div>

<p><br></p>
<p>My grandparents' house saw many firsts.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was the first house in Black River<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>to have a telephone, the first to have electricity, the first to have running<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>hot water, and the first to have an indoor toilet.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Of course the toilet and the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>light bulbs and the hot water depended on the electricity, and that came from a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>generator that rarely worked.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Thus we basked in firsts but like everyone else<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>in Black River we used kerosene lamps and bathed in a bathtub filled by lugging<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>up stairs water heated in<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>the kitchen wood stove. Youngsters weren't worth the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>lugging, and were thought to have not much dignity, and so late on Saturdays<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>they were bathed in a zinc washtub set in the middle of the kitchen floor.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>the most private of moments everyone resorted to<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>an outdoor privy and chamber<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>pots.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Chamber pots could be quite fancy.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Every home in Black River had one or more<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>wash stands, each containing a small bowl for washing, a water pitcher, a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>wastewater bowl, and a chamber pot.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Today these are just for show, but when I<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>was a boy these were the hallmarks of a well kept home and a public display that<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>cleanliness is next to Godliness. Given the circumstances and the equipment, we<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>were about as clean as could be expected.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>For that matter, we were probably<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>about as Godly as could be expected, all things considered.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I was always too young to be trusted with carrying a brimming chamber pot<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>downstairs and outside to wherever filled pots went to, and so I know nothing<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>about that end of the business. Nor to this day do I care to. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Outhouses, privies, were small clapboard or shingled buildings; ours was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>whitewashed inside and out, rather elegant touches. Outhouses had a door, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>running along the back there was a low bench that usually had two holes--a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>larger one for adults and a smaller one for children. It took only one mistake<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>for a child to know which hole to use. There were exceptions to the outhouse law<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>of simplicity. I knew of one outhouse where the holes were covered by a hinged<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>lid, and I once saw an outhouse with real toilet seats.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Outhouse amenities were few.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There were nails for hanging clothes, an Eaton's<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>catalog,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>and a<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>bucket containing quicklime and a small scoop. The catalog<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>provided reading for those sitting, and the catalog's underwear advertisements<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>provided inspiration for those<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>standing. Sitters used the softer pages of the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>catalog, but a new catalog was never available until sitters had to resort to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>the hard glossy pages.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When there were guests, there might be toilet paper,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>although I never saw any in anyone else's outhouse.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Scoops of lime were<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>sprinkled on the "night soil" to hasten decomposition and keep down the odor. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Some outhouses also had a stick that was rattled around in the latrine hole to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>scare away any real or imagined creature that might do you harm, or, if the soil<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>pit was not completely enclosed, to shoo the occasional chicken out of harm's<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>way.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The front door to the outhouse had a small opening to admit light; usually the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>opening was a carved half moon, an ancient symbol for female.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Early estates had<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>two outhouses--one for females and one for males, and the male door<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>carving was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>a sunburst.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Our one-room schoolhouse in Upper Black River had an outhouse with<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>separate doors separate two-holers for boys and girls; I don't remember what<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>symbols or words were on the doors, probably "Boys" and "Girls."<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>At night it<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>didn't matter what your symbol was, you had to have a lantern, and for that<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>purpose one was kept<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>by the door nearest to the outhouse. On winter nights, of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>course, there was always the chamber pot. There was probably some etiquette<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>covering guests' use of the chamber pot, and I would like to know it.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The bottom part of the rear outside of the outhouse was hinged to provide access<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>when it was time to shovel out and cart away the night soil. Some folks believed<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>that this soil was the best fertilizer for the kitchen garden, while others were<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>so leery of that notion that they declined to eat vegetables at homes where this<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>was the practice. As far as I know, it was not the practice at our home.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I hope<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>not. But then I've been living in cities for quite a while.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Most outhouses were situated below the level of well water, an aromatic distance<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>from the house,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>and as privately placed<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>as space,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>getting there time, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>terrain allowed. My Watling cousins had what I thought to be the best of all<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>outhouses in that it was indoors.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You went from their kitchen into a series of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>attached barns, and at the end of one barn floor was the privy--one could<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>scarcely call it an outhouse.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Thus users were at all times sheltered from the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>elements.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Moreover, if memory serves me right, there were four holes!<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Intriguing.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Today outhouses are objects of fun, hillbilly symbols, marks of<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>backward people<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>living in primitive conditions.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But to my way of thinking, outhouses and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>chamber pots are hallmarks of democracy, disposals for false modesty, examples<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>of simplicity and practicality, essential parts of the system that forged<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>the <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>unassuming, self-reliant<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>folks I knew as a child in Black River, New Brunswick.</p>
