<div class="reader-summary">Email from Jerry LeBlanc (undated, received Feb 2008) requesting information about William Jubal Watling (b. 1902 Newcastle, m. 1919 Bertha Maud Armstrong in Saint John, d. 1974 Ottawa, Bertha d. 1980 Capital Memorial Gardens, Nepean). Queries whether William and Bertha had children, seeks Malcolm Watling contact (possibly deceased Sept 2006). Indicates Don&#x27;s genealogical database was referenced for Watling family information and his willingness to share details with researchers. Shows continued inquiries about the Watling line into 2008.</div>

<div class="reader-content">
<p>Hi Donald,<br>
<br>
I am currently researching the Little line (William Bell Little came to<br>
Queens County, NB in 1820) and I have a question concerning the Watlings<br>
(not sure if this is part of your line or not).<br>
<br>
William Jubal Watling married Bertha Maud Armstrong in 1919 in Saint John.<br>
William would have been born in 1902 in Newcastle. I believe William and<br>
Bertha moved to Ottawa. William died in 1974, Bertha in 1980 (interment -<br>
Capital Memorial Gardens, Nepean, Carleton County, Ontario). I was going to<br>
ask Malcolm Watling - Ottawa (he is also listed on the NBGS Surname page for<br>
the Watlings) to see if he was related but his e-mail bounced back. I hope<br>
he is not the Malcolm Watling who passed away in Sept. 2006 in Ottawa?<br>
<br>
Just wondering if you have any details for William and Bertha (exact day<br>
that died - have access to the Ottawa Citizen at our local library) - names<br>
of children etc.<br>
<br>
Bertha would have been a greatgranddaughter of William Bell Little.<br>
<br>
Regards,<br>
<br>
Jerry Leblanc</p>
