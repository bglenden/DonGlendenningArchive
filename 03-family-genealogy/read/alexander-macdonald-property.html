  Alexander MacDonald Property
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">A short document based on A. W. MacDougall&#x27;s &quot;Black River and Its First Settlers&quot; (1935), documenting Alexander MacDonald&#x27;s land acquisition at Little Branch (Lot #3, Third Division) in 1803. Includes a vivid anecdote of MacDonald wading across a creek to extend his land grant while surveyors followed by canoe. Speculates on property locations relative to current residents (Norman Glendenning, Neil Watling, Uncle Jim) and discusses the division of property between his son John and daughter Jessie, with dates of property transfers and Don&#x27;s father&#x27;s 1912 purchase of Jessie&#x27;s property. Shows Don&#x27;s detailed local knowledge and family connections to the land.</div>

<p><b>Alexander MacDonald Property</b><b></b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The following was taken from the book by A. W. MacDougall.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span>A</span>Alexander MacDonald came from the Highlands with the 1803 immigration.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He settled on Lot #3 of the Third Division, on the west side of the southwest branch of Black River...</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>It has been told of the elder Mr MacDonald , that when the Government Surveyors were allotting the land to the prospective settlers, he was told to proceed along the shore till he had secured a sufficient frontage for his lot, the surveying party following him downstream in a canoe.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Land being plentiful, Mr. MacDonald decided to secure as large a grant as possible.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>After he had gone a considerable distance, his further progress was barred by a creek, but he plunged in and waded across, only to be brought to a halt on the other side by the government men, who considered that he had already acquired sufficient.<span>@</span><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>(Would this be Miller<span>=</span>s Brook?)</p>
<p>I have not searched the titles but believe that the Alexander MacDonald property would be the properties now owned by Norman Glendenning I have not searched the titles but believe that the Alexander Macdonald lproperty would be the properties now owned by Norman Glendenning and Neil Watling. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I do not know, but it is likely that the Alexander MacDonald home was located above the home now occupied by Norman Glendenning.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There was a depression, like that from an old basement, near the orchard.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Since the Little Branch River provided transportation, it would make sense to be close to the water.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Lillian recalls old lumber piled in the field roughly in that area.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is possible, however, that the house was actually in the next field above the orchard (Uncle Jim<span>=</span>s field).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>At one time there was a pump in this field.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>If I<span>=</span>m correct, half the property was given to or purchased by his son John and the other half passed to or was purchased by daughter, Jessie (1823-1912).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Dad bought Jessie<span>=</span>s property in 1912.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The John MacDonald property passed to Jubal and Grace (MacDonald) Watling.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They moved from Upper Black River (above MacBeath<span>=</span>s Bridge) to the Branch to look after John and/or Elspeth (Jardine) MacDonald and were given the property in return. (Believed to be before 19030.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As I further understand it, Jubal left the property to sons James and Ernest; later Ernest sold his share to James (Uncle Jim)</p>
