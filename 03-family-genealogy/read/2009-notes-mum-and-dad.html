<div class="reader-summary">Detailed biographical essay by Don about his father Elmer Alton Glendenning (1875-1938) and mother Jane Elizabeth Jardine Watling (1890-1964). Covers Elmer&#x27;s early years in Canobie, family values regarding education, Portland cartage and lumber business, dam construction work across North America (Tennessee, Virginia, Connecticut, Texas, Alabama), return to Little Branch farming, pulp business, community involvement (church, Agricultural Society, Masonic Lodge), and final illness. Documents Jane&#x27;s early life in Portland, her devotion to church and community, hospitality to visitors, food preservation, yarn trading, bread-making, and care of oil lamps. Captures wartime community changes and parents&#x27; influence on Don&#x27;s life.</div>

<div class="reader-content">
<p>ELMER ALTON GLENDENNING</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Elmer was the second child and first son, to Walter and Elizabeth (Peters) Glendenning, was born in Canobie on land that is now a grove of trees directly across the road from the Canobie School, now the Women’s Institute Hall.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>It is likely that he went to the one room school on a corner of his Uncle’s farm next door since the family seems to have valued education; this is not surprising in that his grandmother was a teacher and lived in the home until Elmer was 20.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As further evidence, his brother, Chip took a business course, Guy studied but did not finish dentistry and Margaret trained as a nurse.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is likely that Dad took some technical courses; I remember some engineering books at home.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>His oldest sister, Venetia, provided a home for his sister, Margaret, so that she could finish high school in Portland; I believe that Uncle Guy also completed high school there; maybe others did as well. <span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Elmer’s father was a farmer and, judging by the amount of land accumulated, a successful one at that.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Elmer, and all the boys, and maybe even the girls, would be expected to do their share.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The land would have to be cleared of trees, and those who know Canobie, will remember the stony fields; and all the work would be done by hand or with the aid of horses.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>At that time he probably knew people, even friends, who went to Maine or New Hampshire during the winter to work in the woods and then return to farm and fish in the summer; he may have even done that himself. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The Glendennings were well established in Portland in the first decade of the 1900s. Frank moved there in 1898 and Elmer by 1901. Venetia, the oldest child, seems to have played the role of "host" as each new family member moved south.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Venetia lived in Falmouth Foreside which is between Portland and Freeport.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Other siblings known to have lived in Portland, at least for a while, include Margaret, Raymond and Guy. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In addition, Maude and her husband, Jim Cormier lived in Lincoln, New Hampshire where Uncle Jim Cormier worked in the mill, and Leonard and his family lived in Maine.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We also know, for example, that his Aunt, Mary Ann (Harley) who had married a Stevens and lived next door in Canobie, had moved to Portland to be with family after her husband died in 1870. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Land grant records show that Lot # 28 in Canobie, 100 acres, was granted to Atton E. Glendenning on 1901-07-06.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Prior to his marriage in 1910, we know that Elmer, his brother, Frank, and likely brothers Ray and Guy operated a trucking business under the name Glendenning Bros. &amp; Co. (All Kinds of Team Work). At 24 Hammond Street. They had horses and wagons and did all kinds of hauling.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Portland was the terminus of the Great Northern Railway, later the CNR, which meant that much goods would be moved, in all kinds of combinations, from trains, ships to warehouses, retail stores and homes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>One role Dad told about was that of delivering ice to homes. Elmer also had crews of men and horses in the woods in<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>winter, we believe in both Maine and new Hampshire, but possibly also in Vermont.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Other people from Black river worked with him including his brother-in-law, James A. Watling<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>and Ramsay MacLean (a nephew of Adam MacLean who was married to Elmer’s first cousin. Millie.)According to Herbert Daley, Herb Daley, Dad’s first cousin, also worked in the woods with Elmer. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>In the first decade of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, Elmer and his brothers operated a cartage business in Portland, Maine.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I believe that his brother, Frank, was a partner in the business and others may have been as well.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Bobby Glendenning believes said that his father, Guy, worked in the business and brother Ray worked with them as a blacksmith.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><span>By 1910, Elmer was working on the Rothschild dam in Wausau, Wisconsin, however, on January 25, 1910 he mailed a letter from<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Wausau to Jeannie Glendenning in Portland; some dams were being built to improve the rafting of logs; others were built for the generation of power. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span>Elmer and Jane were married in Litle Branch in 1910 and returned to Portland, however, by February 1911 they were living in </span>Parksville, Tennessee. Where Elmer worked on Ocoee #1, the first of three dams build on the Ocoee River. Later Mum and Dad moved up the Ocoee River to Caney Creek where a second dam was built.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>(This project included the construction of a flume line to carry water for five<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>miles over valleys and along rocky ledges to a head pond with a drop of 250 feet to the turbines below.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The flume line is designated as a national historic site.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Over the next few years they moved from construction site to construction site in Hampton, Virginia, Mussel Shoals. Alabama, North haven, Connecticut, <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Dad also worked for a while in Abiline, Texas.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>On July 21, 1914, Elmer bought the Jessie MacDonald property at Little Branch<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>and they move there during late 1913 or early 1914.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In late 1916 they moved to Fairhaven, Connecticut where they lived at 3 Perkins Street.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>By 1919, the rtook up permanent residence at their home in Little Branch.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Over the years he purchased a number of other properties, one for each of his sons.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>It was a mixed farm and included cows, pigs, hens, geese, horses, turkeys; crops included a farm garden, oats, barley, wheat, buckwheat, and hay.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As a result, income, or other good through trade, was obtained from eggs, chickens,, beef, pork, the sale of weaners (Piglets four to six weeks old), geese, turkeys, ducks, bales of hay, bags of grain, cream, potatoes, furnace wood, and butter, etc.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In addition, it ensured that the family had meat and potatoes for their own use.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>For a while he had a team of oxen which he used around the farm.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Lillian remembers using them to haul sap from back on the "ridge".</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Elmer active in the community including the building of St. Paul's Presbyterian Church (on June 14, 1926 was elected to the first Board of Managers (Trustees), was a prime mover in the construction of a community hall.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The first hall was opened in 1931 and burned to the ground in 1932.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A second hall was built in 1933.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He was active in the Orange Lodge, Oddfellows, and Masons.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>In addition to farming, he and his brother-in-law, John W. MacNaughton operated a pulp business. They operated a "rosser", a machine for peeling pulp in Middle Black River, across from the Cameron School, and operated lumber camps in St. Margaret's and the Black River area. (Across the road from the Cameron school) He continued to be active in construction and built the bridge at John Godfrey's and John Dick's. His last job away from home was the construction of Tinker Dam near Woodstock, NB</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Elmer Glendenning was known as a hard worker. He built and repaired his own harness, re-soled the children’s shoes, and made axe handles. Even when he was not able to work, Brydone Weeks told that Dad had himself taken to the field in a wheelbarrow where he sharpened the scythes while the men were cutting marsh hay.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Dad suffered for a number of years with pernicious anaemia (or was it leukemia ?).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Walter remembers the wagon rack breaking one evening when coming from the woods with a load of wood.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Later he and Dad returned to the woods, unloaded the wood, cut poles, repaired the wagon rack, and returned home so that the wagon load of wood was ready to be taken to Loggieville the next day.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Part of the repair work was carried out by the light of a lantern.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Lillian remembers Dad up on the roof shingling at daybreak. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Dad was a founding member of an Agricultural Society (#103) and was its Secretary Treasurer for fourteen years.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>An Agricultural Society, and there were many throughout the Province,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>was like a Co-op.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Farmers banded together and bought seeds, lime and fertilizer, etc. in bulk and sold it to themselves</p>

<p><b>Jane Watling</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Jane was the second youngest of a family of eight born to Jubal Watling and Grace MacAskill MacDonald, born, presumably at home, at the Meadows, Upper Black River, New Brunswick.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She was named after Jane Elizabeth Jardine who married Donald Cameron (Cameron Russell’s grandmother)</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>When she was about 10 years old, the family moved from the Meadows to Little Branch.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She attended the Upper Black River school and later the school at Little Branch.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Jane arrived in Portland on January 24, 1908 just prior to her 18th birthday. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Jane arrived at the train station in Portland in the early morning of January 24, 1908 and waited for her brother, George, to meet her. Apparently he came to the station but did not recognize her. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She had grown up while he was away from Black River.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Her brother Jack also worked in Portland at that time and likely there were many cousins. We also know that her brother Jim worked in Portland in a chemist/pharmacy, and also in photography, but whether he was there at that time we do not know. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Among Mum’s possessions was an envelope, addressed in Dad’s handwriting and mailed from Wisconsin, showing Mum’s address as 130 Emery Street, Portland.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>She married Elmer Glendenning on October 18, 1910 and returned to the US where they lived and worked for the next nine years; .Information about this period is found in the notes about Elmer.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>In Black river, Jane was active in her church, the Women’s Missionary society and the Women’s league.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She was also a long time member of the women’s institute.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She liked to read and, in the early years at least, wrote poetry.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>After 28 years of marriage, Jane Elizabeth Jardine (Watling) became a widow in 1939; she was 48 at the time.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The two oldest daughters, Grace and Venetia, were married and living elsewhere; her daughter, Lillian, was living and working in the Boston area.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Elinor and the five boys, the youngest being nine years old, were living at home.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The next decade, the wartime years, brought a number of significant changes to the community.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The commencement of classes, and the construction of the Miramichi Rural High School, allowed young people of the community to continue their schooling to the end of high school while continuing to live at home; before this, the nearest high school was in Loggieville, eleven miles away.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The looming war resulted in the construction of an airbase at Chatham, a radar station at St. Margaret’s, and a bombing range on the road to Loggieville.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>These developments meant a significant growth of non-farm jobs for the community.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The outbreak of hostilities also soon resulted in sons, sons-in-law, neighbours, relatives and friends entering the armed forces.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The decade also brought improved roads, regular bus service to Chatham and electric lights.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>By the end of the decade, Black River had moved from a barter to a cash economy.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Although the sons continued to operate the family farm for the next decade, the decade also brought significant changes to the family;<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Walter finished building his house on the Dan MacLean property, married and moved out; Lillian returned to New Brunswick and married; Elinor, Kenneth, Norman and Don attended the new Miramichi High School; Walter, Kenneth and Norman served in the armed forces; John, after operating the farm during the war, married, built a house and moved to the Bob MacLean property; Elinor married and moved out; Kenneth returned from military service, married and moved away; Don finished high school and entered teaching; Norman married and settled on the home place. <span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Jane continued to be active in the community generally and encouraged her family and others to do the same.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She was especially active in her church, the Women’s Missionary Society, the Presbyterian League and the Women’s Institute.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She believed in education and supported the construction of a high school for the area; she also encouraged her family and others to continue their schooling. (It is interesting to note that the Miramichi Rural High School was the first rural high school in the Province; immediately following WW2, the number grew rapidly with, I believe, federal financial support, until there were approximately 50 rural high schools throughout the New Brunswick.)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span></p>
<p>Norman and Jean married in 1951 and Mum continued to live with them until she died in 1964. Mum died in the Miramichi Hospital of cancer of the pancreas having been in the hospital only about two weeks. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The following vignettes are intended to round out the picture of Mother, her interests, activities and passions:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>While discussing VE Day with Vance MacNaughton in June of 1995 at the shopping mall in Douglastown, he told Ken and I about his memory of VE Day (May 8, 1944).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As readers will know, the Little Branch School was down the road and across the brook from home.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Vance was a student in the school at the time when, suddenly, there was a knock and, without waiting for a response, the door flew open the school door flew open and Mum announced to teacher and students alike "The War is over". <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Mother had no formal training as a nurse but made herself available and was frequently called upon by others in the community in time of need such as for a birth or death in a family. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Her “ pin money” came from trading wool for yarn.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The wool was wash in rainwater heated on the kitchen stove, carried to the front yard, washed and rinsed several times and spread on the grass to dry then gathered up and bagged.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>down into the grass and, therefore, being difficult to gather and bag when dry. The bags wool were loaded into the Model A Ford and taken to Brown’s Woolen Mills in Nelson where it would be made into yarn.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She bartered her wool for skeins of yarn in colours, but mostly in white or grey. She knitted mitts and socks for the family, and sometimes for Christmas gifts, and sold surplus yarn to neighbours and, I think, she had some customers by mail.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Bread was a staple and a large family required many loaves of bread each week.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The recipe was mixed in a large, round blue-enamelled, bread pan.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A cake of Fleischmann’s yeast was “started” in a cup of warm water.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The dough was made into loaves, set in a warm place to rise, and then put in the oven to bake.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My recollection is that she would make 7 loaves at a time twice a week. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Mother loved to have visitors.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There were a half-dozen at every meal and putting up a meal for 15 after church on Sunday, or any other day, did not faze her a bit or if it did, she did not let on.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I cannot ever even once remember her saying, I wish they hadn’t or wouldn’t come today.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Meals were not fancy but they were always tasty.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Of course, when the visitors were family, the daughters or daughters-in-law, pitched in to help.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Oil lamps were tended early each day so that, when night fell, there was no scramble for a light.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We had three oil lamps plus, in later years, an Aladdin lamp.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Lamps were filled with kerosene, wicks were trimmed, globes were wiped first with an old newspaper to remove the soot, then washed, dried and replaced.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When finished, the kerosene lights were placed on a shelf beside the clock high on the kitchen wall. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The Aladdin lamp used gas, naphtha?, and did not require such daily care.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Securing food for the coming winter was a major concern in a household.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>While Mother had no special role in the planting or harvesting, she played the major role in pressuring food for winter.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The first step was to have a good garden, which resulted in potatoes, carrots and turnips stored in bins in the basement.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Carrots were a bit more complex and were usually stored in sand in the basement.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Apples were stored in a cold bedroom, usually the large bedroom over the driveway.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Some preserves were put up – peaches, cucumber pickles, chow and mustard beans.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Several baskets of peaches were purchased and these were bottled along with some strawberries, blueberries and maybe even raspberries. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
