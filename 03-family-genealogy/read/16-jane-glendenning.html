After
28 years of marriage, Jane Elizabeth Jardine (Watling) became a widow
in 1939; she was 48 at the time.  The two oldest daughters, Grace and
Venetia, were married and living elsewhere; her daughter, Lillian,
was living and working in the Boston area.  Elinor and the five boys,
the youngest being nine years old, were living at home.</p>

The
next decade, the wartime years, brought a number of significant
changes to the community.  The commencement of classes, and the
construction of the Miramichi Rural High School, allowed young people
of the community to continue their schooling to the end of high
school while continuing to live at home; before this, the nearest
high school was in Loggieville, eleven miles away.  The looming war
resulted in the construction of an airbase at Chatham, a radar
station at St. Margaret’s, and a bombing range on the road to
Loggieville.  These developments meant a significant growth of
non-farm jobs for the community.  The outbreak of hostilities also
soon resulted in sons, sons-in-law, neighbours, relatives and friends
entering the armed forces.  The decade also brought improved roads,
regular bus service to Chatham and electric lights.  By the end of
the decade, Black River had moved from a barter to a cash economy.</p>

Although
the sons continued to operate the family farm for the next decade,
the decade also brought significant changes to the family;  Walter
finished building his house on the Dan MacLean property, married and
moved out; Lillian returned to New Brunswick and married; Elinor,
Kenneth, Norman and Don attended the new Miramichi High School;
Walter, Kenneth and Norman served in the armed forces; John, after
operating the farm during the war, married, built a house and moved
to the Bob MacLean property; Elinor married and moved out; Kenneth
returned from military service, married and moved away; Don finished
high school and entered teaching; Norman married and settled on the
home place.

Mother
continued to be active in the community generally and encouraged her
family and others to do the same.  She was especially active in her
church, the Women’s Missionary Society, the Presbyterian League and
the Women’s Institute.  She believed in education and supported the
construction of a high school for the area; she also encouraged her
family and others to continue their schooling. (It is interesting to
note that the Miramichi Rural High School was the first rural high
school in the Province; immediately following WW2, the number grew
rapidly with, I believe, federal financial support, until there were
approximately 50 rural high schools throughout the New Brunswick.)

Norman
and Jean married in 1951 and Mum continued to live with them until
she died in 1964. Mum died in the Miramichi Hospital of cancer of the
pancreas having been in the hospital only about two weeks.

her interests, activities and passions:</p>

	While
	discussing VE Day with Vance MacNaughton in June of 1995 at the
	shopping mall in Douglastown, he told Ken and I about his memory of
	VE Day (May 8, 1944).  As readers will know, the Little Branch
	School was down the road and across the brook from home.  Vance was
	a student in the school at the time when, suddenly, there was a
	knock and, without waiting for a response, the door flew open the
	school door flew open and Mum announced to teacher and students
	alike &quot;The War is over&quot;.  
	</p></li>
	<li><p lang="en-GB" align="justify" style="orphans: 2; widows: 2; font-weight: normal">
	Mother
	had no formal training as a nurse but made herself available and was
	frequently called upon by others in the community in time of need
	such as for a birth or death in a family.  
	</p></li>
	<li><p lang="en-CA" align="justify" style="orphans: 2; widows: 2; font-weight: normal">
	<span lang="en-GB">Mother
	always took the lead role in the washing of the wool and trading it
	for yarn.  </span>After the
	snow and ice disappeared but before the grass grew, it was necessary
	to wash the wool.  It was a major undertaking.  
	</p></li>
</ul>
<p lang="en-CA" align="justify" style="margin-left: 0.29in; orphans: 2; widows: 2; font-weight: normal">
<br />

</p>
<p lang="en-CA" align="justify" style="margin-left: 0.5in; orphans: 2; widows: 2; font-weight: normal">
In
preparation for washing, rainwater was saved in large tubs and
buckets.  Rainwater was used because it was softer than water from
the well thereby using less soap but more important, resulting in
cleaner wool; in addition, without electricity, water would have had
to be pumped by hand.  Also, a bench was set up in the front yard to
hold the tubs.  In addition, The bags of wool were opened and the
real dirty parts were snipped off and discarded.</p>
<p lang="en-CA" style="orphans: 2; text-indent: 0.5in; widows: 2; font-weight: normal">
<br />

</p>
<p lang="en-CA" style="margin-left: 0.5in; orphans: 2; widows: 2; font-weight: normal">
The
water was heated on the kitchen stove, carried to the yard, and then
the wool was washed and rinsed several times.  Once Mum was satisfied
that the wool was clean, thin swatches were spread on the grass to
dry.  The clumps were small and kept thin so that they would dry
quickly.    The wool would be left over night, or perhaps over a
couple of nights, to dry then gathered up and bagged.  Leaving the
wool too many days spread out on the grass resulted in the wool
settling down into the grass and, therefore, being difficult to
gather and bag when dry.</p>

<br />

</p>
<p lang="en-CA" style="margin-left: 0.5in; orphans: 2; widows: 2; font-weight: normal">
The
bags of dry, clean wool were loaded into the Model A Ford and taken
to Brown’s Woolen Mills in Nelson where it would be converted into
yarn.  I was there only once but I remember the big machines and the
noise.  Brown’s had, I believe, the only woollen mill on the
Miramichi at that time.  Negations were based on the weight of the
wool.  One could (1) get one’s own yarn back after it was converted
into yarn by paying the cost of processing but that meant a return
trip to pick up your yarn.  (2) One could get an equal amount of
yarn, but not your own, on the day you took your wool to the mill
provided you paid for the processing.  What Mother usually did, in
effect, was to sell her wool to the mill, purchase the number of
skeins and colours of yarn she wanted, and pay the difference in
cash.

<p lang="en-CA" style="margin-left: 0.5in; orphans: 2; widows: 2; font-weight: normal">
Mum
usually had more wool than she needed, so she sold some to neighbours
and, I think, she had some customers by mail.</p>

	Mother,
	like other mothers in the community, knitted all our socks, mitts
	and sometimes sweaters.  She could knit a pair of mitts or socks in
	a day or two and usually knitted while resting, visiting or talking
	with family in the evening.  She often knitted socks or mitts for
	relatives or friends as Christmas gifts.  The men wore heavy woollen
	sock both summer and winter; I cannot remember when I had my first
	pair of “store-bought socks.</p></li>
	<li><p lang="en-CA" style="orphans: 2; widows: 2; font-weight: normal">
	Bread
	was a staple and a large family required many loaves of bread each
	week.  The recipe was mixed in a large, round blue-enamelled, bread
	pan.  A cake of Fleischmann’s yeast was “started” in a cup of
	warm water.  The dough was made into loaves, set in a warm place to
	rise, and then put in the oven to bake.  My recollection is that she
	would make 7 loaves at a time twice a week.  Often of an evening
	when Mother went off to a Missionary meeting, I was left to keep the
	fire going and bake the bread.</p></li>
	<li><p lang="en-CA" style="orphans: 2; widows: 2; font-weight: normal">
	Mother
	loved to have visitors.  There were a half-dozen at every meal and
	putting up a meal for 15 after church on Sunday, or any other day,
	did not faze her a bit or if it did, she did not let on.  I cannot
	ever even once remember her saying, I wish they hadn’t or wouldn’t
	come today.  Meals were not fancy but they were always tasty.  Of
	course, when the visitors were family, the daughters or
	daughters-in-law, pitched in to help.</p></li>
	<li><p lang="en-CA" style="orphans: 2; widows: 2; font-weight: normal">
	Oil
	lamps were tended early each day so that, when night fell, there was
	no scramble for a light.  We had three oil lamps plus, in later
	years, an Aladdin lamp.  Lamps were filled with kerosene, wicks were
	trimmed, globes were wiped first with an old newspaper to remove the
	soot, then washed, dried and replaced.  When finished, the kerosene
	lights were placed on a shelf beside the clock high on the kitchen
	wall.   The Aladdin lamp used gas, naphtha?, and did not require
	such daily care. 
	</p></li>
	<li><p lang="en-CA" style="orphans: 2; widows: 2; font-weight: normal">
	Securing
	food for the coming winter was a major concern in a household. 
	While Mother had no special role in the planting or harvesting, she
	played the major role in pressuring food for winter.  The first step
	was to have a good garden, which resulted in potatoes, carrots and
	turnips stored in bins in the basement.  Carrots were a bit more
	complex and were usually stored in sand in the basement.  Apples
	were stored in a cold bedroom, usually the large bedroom over the
	driveway.  Some preserves were put up – peaches, cucumber pickles,
	chow and mustard beans.  Several baskets of peaches were purchased
	and these were bottled along with some strawberries, blueberries and
	maybe even raspberries.  
	</p></li>
	<li><p lang="en-CA" style="orphans: 2; widows: 2; font-weight: normal">
	The
	advent of the home canner gave a new twist to preserving – that of
	canning.  Boxes of empty cans and covers were purchased, after
	sterilizing the cans, peas and beans blanched and packed into the
	cans.  The cans were then sealed and boiled for a couple of hours in
	a barrel or huge pot over an open fire.  Then they were cooled
	quickly, labelled and stored for the winter.  If the ends of cans
	did not snap back when cooled, those cans were considered unsafe and
	opened immediately</p></li>
