<p>Elizabeth Peters, daughter of John Peters and Jane Sealey was born on 23 Sep 1848. She died<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>on 14 May 1915.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Notes for Walter Glendenning:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Walter Glendenning was the second son of John and Elizabeth (Harley) Glendinning and was born<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>on 26 November 1845 while the family was still living at Salmon Beach.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>On March 2, 1872 Walter Glendenning, married Elizabeth Peters; on February 17, 1873, Lot 30<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>was granted in Walter's name. It is interesting to note that, while John, Sr. petitioned for the lots,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>they were actually granted in the name of the sons. Walter's father and mother continued to live<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>with them until their deaths, John, Sr. died in 1877 leaving, as the 1881 census shows, Walter as<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>the head of the household:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Walter Glendinning of the Parish of New Bandon petitioned (F9029) for one hundred acres situate<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>as follows: Lot No. 30, Canobie, formerly surveyed for Charles Scott. By him transferred to John<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Glendinning and from John Glendinning to his son Walter the present applicant. The land is said to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>be occupied by the applicant, Walter Glendinning, and his father and improved by applicant and his<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>father. A notation on the top of the petition shows 1865. Interestingly, the top of this form is<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>pre-printed with the word "AUCTION".<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>My other source shows a grant of Lot #30 in Canobie to Walter Glendenning on February 17, 1783.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>That is quite a lag between the making of a petition and the actual grant being made.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The property is directly across from the Canobie School, which is now the Women's Institute Hall.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The old home stood, among what is now a clump of trees. I believe that the homestead was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>inherited by his son, Leonard; later generations knew the area as Leonard's Hill.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Walter was active in the church including being a Sunday school teacher. At first, church services<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>were held in the local school. Later Trinity Union Church was erected in 1899 about a mile from<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>the Glendinning property and was used by Presbyterians, Methodists and Anglicans. (It is now an<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Anglican Church). Walter is reported to have been one of the first trustees and, according to the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Chaleur history, cut the first lumber to start the building. It is a small church with 8-10 pews on each<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>side. The names of Mr. and Mrs. Walter Glendenning are included on a plaque in memory of the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>early church families. (Mr. and Mrs. John Glendenning's names are also included)<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Walter lived in Canobie and was active in community affairs. In 1882 he was one of the people<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>responsible for turn piking a new road into the Springfield Settlement. He was also a successful<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>mixed farmer. According to his will, on his death, he owned:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>" Lot No. 30, Canobie, the old homestead, formerly surveyed for Charles Scott. But<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>transferred to John Glendinning and from John Glendinning to his son Walter.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>" 100 acres in Canobie, which I believe to be Lot #28, which he left to his wife, Elizabeth. It<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>appears that my father, Elmer, bought this land originally and then sold (?) it to his father. This<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>was likely the lot where Uncle Chip lived.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>" the Stevens Farm in Canobie containing 100 acres which he left to, Elizabeth, with the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>proviso that it be transferred to his son Raymond if he returned to settle in Canobie.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>" 50 acres, the original Taylor Farm, which was left to his wife Elizabeth. This property is<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>immediately west of and adjoins the Stevens farm. Apparently this land was left to or purchased by<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>his daughter. Venetia. Guy Glendenning said that Venetia sold the property to Matt. Ellis<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Walter Glendenning developed pneumonia and died while visiting his daughter, Venetia Doring<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>(and other family members) who were living in Falmouth Foreside near Portland Maine at the time.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p>was written on January 6, 1908 just five weeks before he died. After his death, his wife, Elizabeth,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>went to live with her daughter Venetia in Falmouth, Foreside, Maine. She died there on May 14,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p>Elizabeth Peters, born in Canobie, was the daughter of John Peters (October 23, 1821 -June 31,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>1904) and Jane (Sealy) Peters (December 24, 1821 -September 12, 1892). According to a note in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p>Venetia Emily Glendenning was born on 09 Dec 1872 in Canobie, NB. She died on<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p>He died on 27 May 1936.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Notes for Venetia Emily Glendenning:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Aunt Venetia lived in Falmouth Foreside just north of Portland, Maine; she may<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>have been the focal point for her brothers and sisters when they first moved to the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>USA.. On a number of occasions, she drove from Florida to NB. On one trip, she<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>hauled a trailer loaded with camping supplies,and parked near New York City,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>perhaps staying with her sister, Minnie (Glendenning) Weeks, and visited the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>World's Fair.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>On one of her trips, Arthur Adams, son of George and Jessie Finno(?) Adams went<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>back with her. Walter and Grace took Arthur to Ullocks Corner, at Route 11 and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>met Aunt Venetia who drove from Bathurst. I believe that John Doring was with<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Aunt Venetia at that time. Aunt Venetia also came north to my sister, Venetia's<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>wedding in 1937. On this trip, as I recall, Dad decided to show Aunt Venetia around<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>the community. Elinor and I went along in the back seat for the ride. Dad was all<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>over the road as he drove and I remember Aunt Venetia looking at us in the back<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>seat and rolling her eyes.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Venetia remembers when she was about 8 years old that Aunt Venetia, John,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Verna and Glenn drove from Florida and stopped at the Branch. Venetia went with<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p></p>
<p>them to Canobie. Later Aunt Venetia, Aunt Maude and Aunt Jane Knowles<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p>I decided to check out Amatol, New Jersey and found that construction of a plant<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>and a town site for 10,000 people commenced in March, 1918 and was completed<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>in 9 months. The only one of the original buildings still standing is the former<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>barracks of the New Jersey State Police on White Horse Pike. There was a major<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>explosion at the plant on July 10, 1926 but fortunately it was a Saturday and few<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>men were at work. I do not know if there was any rebuilding but, according to what<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>I read, the town soon disappeared. Fascinating story ! Bobby Glendenning told me<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>that his father, Guy Glendenning, worked with bob Doring on the construction of a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>dam/bridge in upper New York State.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>It appears that Bob Doring's ancestors on both sides were United Empire Loyalists<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p>Montreal. I remember Dad leaving for the funeral with his Gladstone bag.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Thanks to Robert Stevens, a Harley descendant and cousin, I learned that Uncle<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Frank went to Portlant in 1898, and, in the year 1900 he was a teamster and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>boarding with his second cousin, Henry Stevens. robert also provided an undated<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>registration form which shws him to be 41 years old, working as a labour foremen at<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>at Plant No.1, Us Nitrate company in Sheffield, Alabama. His employer was the J.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>G White Engineering company, the same company Dad worked for in Virginia. I am<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>wondering now if Dad also worked on the construction of the Nitrate plannt rather<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>than the Wilson Dam. He listed his home address as 543 Forest Ave, Portland<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p><br></p>
<p>They had a cottage at Sebago Lake about 20 miles west of Portland. Aunt Lil spent<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p></p>
<p>considerable time at the cottage after Uncle Frank died. Later Joan Crocker, hetime at the cottage after Uncle Frank died. Later Joan Crocker, her<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p>In 1936 when Dad, Walter, Elinor and I went to bring Grace home for her wedding,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p>Grandson, Walt Berry wrote "I always did enjoy a trip to my Grandparents home. I<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p>the fishing pier and brought home a big mess of lobster. My wife (who is not from<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p>Notes for George Raymond Glendenning:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Uncle Ray inherited a farm in Canobie from his father on condition that he return to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Canobie to live. His father's will was written in 1908; George believes that his father<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>returned to Canobie in 1911, married and continued to farm The original farm<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>home burned and they built a new one on the same spot. Joy Winton thought that<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Uncle Ray had gone a number of times on harvest excursions to Western Canada<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>and also to the USA. George confirmed in 2006 that his father had worked in a nail<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>factory in Minesota where he was involved in the process of galvanizing nails deipping<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>them into the hot zinc by hand. Uncle Ray delivered mail in Clifton from<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>1942 to 1950.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Uncle Ray always smoked a pipe. One time he was knocked down by his horses<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>when they bolted through a gate. He was smoking a pipe at the time. Shortly after,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>he became quite ill and his family did not expect him to live. Eventually, in a fit of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>coughing, he coughed up the stem of the pipe.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p>Chip Glendenning was born in Canobie, New Brunswick and, presumably, went to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>the Canobie school. He went through high school in Mill Neck, Long Island, New<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p><br></p>
<p>Chip worked for the Cero de Pasco Mining company at Cero de Pasco, Peru. I<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>believe that he was working in South America when he was married and come<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>home (1914 or 1915) to be married. Venetia, his daughter, recalled that Aunt<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Louise went to Peru when Clinton was 9 month old (July 1916) Mildred was born<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p>John Glendinning, son of John Glendinning and Mary Rae was born on 02 Apr 1807 in Callister<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Hall, Dumfriesshire, Scotland. He died on 15 May 1877 in Canobie. He married Margaret Harley<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p>on 21 Oct 1895 in Canobie, NB.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Notes for John Glendinning:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>John Glendinning's family Bible, passed to his oldest son, Elmer, tells us that In 1830, he sailed<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>from Annan, a seaport on Dumfriesshire on the south coast of Scotland. This would be the nearest<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>port to where he was born. It is likely, although we have no record, that he landed at Pokeshaw on<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>the Bay Chaleur near Bathurst, New Brunswick, as Pokeshaw was a busy seaport and sailing<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>ships seemed to be a regular stop from overseas. According to Pioneer Settlers of the Bay<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Chaleur, John purchased part of Lot 7 at Salmon Beach, between Pokeshaw and Bathurst, from<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Fidele and Joseph Arceneau. On August 23, 1833, John Glendinning married Margaret Harley who<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>had come from Ireland to New Brunswick to join other family members.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Also, according to Pioneer Settlers, John and Margaret sold their land in 1855 to Abram Buttimer<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>and moved inland to Canobie. We do not know the reason for moving but we do know that<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>waterfront land at Salmon Beach took a heavy beating and some flooding from storms. Also with a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>growing family and cheap land he may have felt that he would give his family a better start in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Canobie.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>John Glendinning petitioned for two lots of 100 acres each in Canobie (F5929, F5931). One<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>petition shows the name as John Glendinning, Sr. and the other shows only John Glendinning but<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>in both cases the age is given as forty-seven years so they are both the same person. The<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>petitions are faint and difficult to read. One petition identifies, in 1854, mentions the west half of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>...(too faint to read) No lot number is given. The lot was vacant but had been improved by<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>applicant. The other petition, in 1855, clearly identifies lot #30 in Canobie which appears to have<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>been surveyed in 1848 for Charles Scott. The lot was vacant but improved -whether improved by<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>John Glendinning, Charles Scott, or someone else we do not know.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>although John Glendinning petitioned for both Lots 30 and 31. when the grants were made,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>however, they were in the names of his sons, John and Walter. He and his family may have been<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>living on the lot since it was not unusual for early settlers to live on land for a number of years<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>before receiving title; they may have even been required to clear a number of acres and even build<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>a house.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>According to the Pioneer Settlers, settlers raised sheep, carded and spun wool and wove cloth.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Pioneer settlers also tells that John Glendinning, presumably the Senior John, owned one of the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>first weaving machines (looms) in Canobie and taught others in the community to weave. My<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>mother remembered Grandmother Glendenning having a shuttle, presumably passed down from<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>the senior Glendinnings. Apparently, the shuttle passed to Aunt Venetia Doring and from her to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>her niece, Cornelia Farrell.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p>Presbyterians, Methodists and Anglicans held church services the local school until the first<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p>Notes for Margaret Harley:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Margaret Harley's father, William, was of English descent but had moved to Courtmacsherry, a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>small town near Cork, Ireland to teach school. He was Presbyterian and, apparently, quite active<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>in the church. Mary Ann, and presumably all her siblings including Margaret, was born in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Courtmasherry and refers to herself as having been raised in the church. Since Margaret was the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>youngest of the family, it is likely that she was born in Courtmacsherry as well.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Margaret (Harley) Glendinning was a schoolteacher and the first school in Salmon Beach was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p>My dearest, dearest wife:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I write you to let you know that I take my departure from this town tomorrow<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>morning for Eastport in the steam packet. I arrived here last Thursday morning<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>from Fredericton and at first engaged in a passage direct to New York in a brig.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>She sailed yesterday, my friends having advised me to the contrary. I did not go in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>her, and it is well, as last night there arose a most tremendous storm which still<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>continued and she is now rocking about the Bay of Fundy, the Lord only knows<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>where.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I called on the Nashwaak as I came over but found only the old lady and John at<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>home. Archy was in the woods and the rest were visiting. I wrote you from Bois's<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>by Willard who promised to take the key of the office which I took away by mistake<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>and left at Nat Moer's. I also sent you two five pound notes by Blake who promised<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>to deliver them through Nathaniel Sprague to you, which also remained with me<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>thro'; mistake in my pocket book. My dearest girl, I have ever since felt so<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>homesick, especially among strangers, that I scarcely think of what I am doing. Let<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>me request of you for heaven's sake to let yourself or our dear little ones want for<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>nothing whatever. I have spoken to Taylor who promised at the shortest notice to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>supply you with any money you may have occasion for and also, my dear, console<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>yourself and let not my absence give you any trouble as you may depend upon my<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>return as quick as possible. I am very much envied, I assure you by several in the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Surveyor General's office here, especially Smith who came with me to St. John and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>returns back today.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>My dear, any wood or anything else you want to have done, Philip Ryan may haul.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Philip's horse I sent down by Carviles with Jenkin's furniture. I hope therefore he<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>has received him safe and sound as I got home. I think if you employe his son to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>chop wood and see the necessary things performed about the house til I come<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>back, you would act wisely as you certainly cannot act without some person in that<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>capacity. John will also, I hope, occasionally visit you as well as John (Henry). On<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>the whole, my dear, let me again and again conjure you for your own sake and mine<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>to want for nothing that may contribute in any way to your comfort. Tomorrow, with<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>God's help, I shall be in the United States and then, and only then, on a fair way on<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>my journey. I shall again write you from New York, or perhaps Boston, as I am as<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p></p>
<p>yet ignorant as to the route I am to take. Archibald will want some new clothes as<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>well as the other children, which I daresay you can get anywhere on my account. I<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>must say that I have received every civility here as well as in Fredericton, and my<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>hardest thoughts are of leaving this province. You are, however, convinced of the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p>well, I shall bring them something handsome from their cousins in Canada. Give<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>my best respects to dear Prue and tell her she must certainly write to me.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p>birthday and the paper carried the following article:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>'I was born in Courtmasherry, Ireland, February 6, 1799. This is a small town only a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>little distance from the city of Cork, near the Bay of Cork. My maiden name was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Mary Ann Harley, and my father was a schoolteacher in the town. I had two<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>brothers and three sisters. All dead now. One of my sisters lived to be 94, died on<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>her birthday. I can remember the town where we lived very well, and the names of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p></p>
<p>friends and schoolmates. I left Ireland in 1822. I can remember about my father<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>and mother talking about the rising of '98; people never seemed to get tired of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>taking about that event. My father was of English descent, a Presbyterian and I<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>was raised in the church.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>and schoolmates. I left Ireland in 1822. I can remember about my father<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p>was raised in the church.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Very well can I remember the day on which two big ships of war sailed into Cork<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>harbor, their decks crowded with men and their masts with gay flags. These ships<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>were bringing us the first news of the battle of Waterloo in which that terror of the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>world and ogre of history, Napoleon Bonaparte was defeated by our own Duke of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Wellington. People went crazy with joy; the bells of the city of Cork were rung, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>great bonfires were lit in celebration of the great event. Three of the officers of an<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Irish regiment were quartered at my father's house for many days, and I remember<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>some of the stories they had to tell of that terrible fight. Their bright uniforms and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>handsome faces made a great impression on me.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>In 1822 I went to visit a lady friend in Queenstown, and while I was there the first<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>steamboat ever to come into Irish waters came into the harbor. Everyone turned<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>out and lined the docks to the strange craft which moved so swiftly through the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>waters without sail or oars. It was a wonderful thing then, but I suppose the people<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>of Queenstown see enough such craft now. While I was in Queenstown I got a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>letter from my brother William in America. He was a government surveyor, and he<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>wanted me to come over as soon as possible as he said he had a young,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>handsome and wealthy husband waiting for me. I went home to my parents and it<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>was decided that I would sail for America.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I was one of 150 passengers on a sailing ship which left Cork on May 7, 1822. It<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>was a terrible voyage. I was sick almost all the way, and glad to see land after<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>seven weeks and three days aboard that ship. I landed at a place called Pockshaw<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>on the Bay of Chaleur. It was a very small settlement then, only a few small houses<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>made of logs. My brother was there waiting for me. We had to walk 75 miles<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>through the woods to get to his home. No roads, no conveyances of any kind, not<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>even a path. It was a trackless forest in which not one tree had been cut. We made<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>our way by means of compass over windfalls and across brooks to Newcastle. We<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>were three nights on the road and we had to sleep in the woods without any shelter.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>On the fourth night we got to Newcastle, a very small settlement. Eight months<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>after my arrival at this place I married John Henry; he was a man of business and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>agent for a large mercantile firm. I had nine children and seven grew up and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>married. I don't know how many descendents I have, but they must number in the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>hundreds. My husband died 28 years ago (1870) I lived on the Miramichi until after<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>my husband's death, then I came to the States where some of my children lived. I<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>had a brother named John Harley who built ships on Bolters Island near<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Newcastle."<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Mary Ann died 22 days before her 99th birthday and is buried in Forest City<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Cemetery, Portland, in a lot owned by her grandson, Fred Stevens.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>It is believed that the Henrys were living on the Miramaichi at the time of the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Miramichi Fire in 1825; in spite of her comment to the reporter, Willis Hamilton<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>writes that, according to the 1861 census, Mary Ann and John Henry were living in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>New Bandon, Gloucester Co. and that they likely were living there when her<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p>move to Utah, John Harley and George Burchill bought it for a fraction of its true<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>value. During tbe next seven years they conducted woods operations, ran a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>sawmill, and built nine ships, all of whicb were sold in Britain. After their partnership<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>was dissolved in 1857, Harley continued to build ships on the island with the help of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>his sons. In all, be is credited with having built sixty-two ships on the Miramichi, the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>last two in 1866. At around this time he lost the island to the Commercial Bank, to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>which it had been mortgaged some years previously. It was bought by Peter<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Mitchell in 1871.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Harley was commissioned a lieutenant in the 2nd Battalion of militia in 1836 and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>promoted to captain in 1846. He retired with this rank in 1864. He undertook<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>numerous community responsibilities at the parish level and in 1855 was appointed<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>a justice of the peace. In 1851 he was made one of the three commissioners of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>lights for the Gulf of St Lawrence. This led to his appointment by the federal<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>government, after Confederation, as inspector of lights, buoys, and beacons in New<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Brunswick. He attended to this work until 1871, when he retired. Meanwhile, in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>1867, he was appointed harbormaster, as successor to Alexander Goodfellow, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>he retained this position until overtaken by illness in 1873.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>To quote the Union Advocate, Harley was "one of those sterling characters whom to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>know was to respect." He and his wife, Ann Coughlan, had three sons and two<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>daughters. One of their daughters was Fanny Harley, the first wife of Charles<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Sargeant.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
