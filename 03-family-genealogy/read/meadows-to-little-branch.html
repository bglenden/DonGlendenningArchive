  Meadows to Little Branch
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">A historical narrative of Don&#x27;s grandparents&#x27; transition from the Meadows to Little Branch. Documents the November 13, 1901 agreement wherein Jubal and Grace Watling (with their four sons George, John, James, and Ernest as parties) took possession of John MacDonald&#x27;s property at Little Branch, assuming lifelong support obligations for Elspeth (Jardine) MacDonald and her son James. Notes Elspeth&#x27;s death on September 12, 1907, and James&#x27;s death on April 1, 1923. Clarifies that the agreement did not include the Jessie McDonald property where Norman Glendenning later lived. Shows the family&#x27;s legal and caregiving relationships within the community.</div>

<p><b>Meadows to Little Branch</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Our Grandfather, Jubal Watling, lived at the Meadows; he married Grace MacDonald who lived at Little Branch – where Neil Watling now lives.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Grandmother’s father, John, died in 1900, I think, and her mother, Elspeth, was not well.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In addition, James, Grandmother’s brother had inherited the farm when his father died, was not married, was living at home but was not able to operate the farm.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As best I can interpret, the land did not include the Jessie McDonald property where Norman Glendenning now lives.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>On November 13, 1901, James entered into an agreement with his sister, Grace and her husband, Jubal.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As parties to the agreement also were Jubal and Grace’s four sons, George, John, James and Ernest.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A copy of this agreement can be found in the Northumberland County Registrar’s office. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>All the land and buildings are to be turned over to the Watlings.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In return, the Watlings will “keep support, maintain and provide the said James J. McDonald and his mother, Mrs. John D. McDonald, each of them and the survivor of them during the respective terms of their natural lives with good and sufficient house, room, meat, drink, washing, clothing, bedding, fire, light, medicine, medical attendance, personal expenses and all such necessaries as persons of their ages and conditions in life usually require and are accustomed to.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The Watlings were also to provide a “decent Christian burial” paying all funeral expenses.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Elspeth (Jardine) MacDonald died September 12, 1907 and James died April 1, 1923.</p>
