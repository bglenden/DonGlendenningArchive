<div class="reader-summary">Family Chronicle (No. 40, May 10, 2003) providing research resources for Crown Land history in New Brunswick (Crown Land Grant Index, maps, Geographical Names reference). Includes genealogical follow-up correcting a photo identifier (Norman Ferguson, grandson of Cynthia Finno and Hector Ferguson—Don&#x27;s second cousin). Supplies revised list of 13 teachers at Little Branch School (1920s-1950s), noting lapses in documentation. Recalls coasting accident with Fraser MacKay (sled riding over birch tree, tumbling to shore ice), trout fishing techniques using alder rods and worms from the wharf and bridge, anecdote about Major Ramsay (tetchy NB Tel employee), and Billy Harper as skilled fisherman mentor. Mentions white string fishing line soaked in strong tea to reduce visibility, and an experimental fish net strung across the river (catching one gasperaux). Demonstrates Don&#x27;s capacity for both archival scholarship and vivid sensory memoir.</div>

	<p>I am
	interested in corrections and additions.</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>George
	reminded me of going coasting behind our barn with Fraser MacKay. 
	Instead of going down over the steep bank, the sled rode out over a
	birch tree leaning over the bank.  George and Fraser tumbled to the
	shore ice below.   
	</p>
	<h6 style="orphans: 0; widows: 0">Trout fishing</h6>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>The Little
	Branch was a great trout stream and, although we fished from the
	shore on occasion, our favourite spot was to fish from the wharf or
	from the rocks by the cove.  The channel ran close to that side of
	the river.  The best time of day, I thought, was either late evening
	or early morning just when the tide was starting to turn –
	starting to come in was preferred.</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>Our
	fishing rods were alders.  In the photo below, George’s rod is
	both straighter and longer.  That is not to say that he caught more
	fish.  We used a hook and worms for bait, and many a worm we
	drowned.  I liked fishing from the corner of the wharf or on our
	side of the bridge letting the line be carried down river with the
	tide.  That was a bit tricky, however, since the hook frequently
	caught on a log under the bridge.  Hooks were in short supply and a
	lost hook was worth talking about.  I didn’t know what a lure was
	although some may have had them.</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>The Branch
	Bridge was also a favourite fishing place for folks who were not
	local.  One frequent visitor was Major Ramsay.  It seems to me that
	he worked at with NB Tel but I am not sure.  He would get upset when
	people would make a noise while he was fishing.  Some school days
	when major Ramsay was fishing at the upper side of the bridge, some
	boys would go near the bridge and throw stones into the water just
	to upset him.</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>Billy
	Harper was an avid and successful fisherman.  When he was fishing, I
	would try to sit as close to him as possible because he always
	seemed to know where the fish were.</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>We did not
	have proper fishing line.  Instead we had white string taken from
	flour or seed</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>

	<p><b>Undated
	photo of George Watling and Don Glendenning taken in the Glendenning
	yard</b><b>. </b><b>
	Note the pile of 2-foot hardwood in the background.  This was our
	winter’s wood for the furnace.</b></p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>bags. 
	Mother would soak the string in strong tea over night so that it
	would not be so white.  
	</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>One time
	George Watling and I found an old piece of net (in Uncle Jim’s
	shed, I believe) and decided to string it across the river.  Late in
	the evening, we climbed along under the bridge and tied the net so
	that it stretched across the river.  Early the next morning, we went
	down to bring home our catch – no trout but I think that we did
	catch one gasperaux.</p>
