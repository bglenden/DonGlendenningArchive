	<p align="justify"><u><b>Early
	Education</b></u></p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">Soon
	after getting settled in their new community, settler’s thoughts
	turned to education. The first home-school in Black River was held
	in a barn belonging to Archibald Cameron, Sr.; the first school in
	Bay du Vin was operated at the home of James Graham near Buckley’s
	Bridge in Bay du Vin.  The task of teaching usually fell to most
	educated person in the community and classes were usually held in
	homes.  Records show that, at least by 1817, a qualified teacher,
	Hugh MacDougald, had been hired to provide instruction 
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">In
	1825, residents of Black River petitioned successfully for a school
	which, as I understand it, was erected near the lane now leading to
	St. Stephen's Church.   This school appears to have served all of
	Black River and as far east as lower Bay du Vin, and included
	trustees from both communities.</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p lang="en-CA" align="justify">Although
	a closer examination of records may show otherwise, History of Bay
	du Vin (1) reports a school at the mouth of the Bay du Vin  River by
	1830, perhaps the Cameron School and a school in Bay side by 1845,
	and the Little Branch School around 1855.  MacDougall (2) reports
	that the Little Branch School burned shortly after construction but
	was soon replaced. 
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">Each
	District had a one room school handling all grades usually up to
	Grade 8 or perhaps Grade 9.  Very few students in the area went
	beyond the studies available at their local school. Those who were
	lucky, attended high school classes in Loggieville or Chatham and
	boarded with

	<p align="justify">relatives
	or friends.  At the time it was possible for students, such as my
	sister Venetia Glendenning and Grace Godfrey, to write Normal school
	entrance exams and be admitted directly to Normal school after grade
	9</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify"><u><b>Winds
	of Change </b></u>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"> 
	</p>
	<p align="justify">Things
	began to change generally in rural New Brunswick by the late 1930’s
	and nowhere was the change more pronounced than in the Black
	River-Bay du Vin area.  
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">The
	Rev. Douglas Smith took up his duties at St. John’s Anglican
	Church, Bay du Vin, in August of 1937 and, recognizing the needs of
	the area, later that year started classes “in his own study at the
	Rectory”; the next year he hired a teacher to help him.

	<p lang="en-CA" align="justify"><img src="img/2-general/img003.png" align="bottom" />
</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">A
	program distributed at the Formal opening of the new school in 1940
	states:</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">“<i>During
	this time, another had joined forces with Mr. Smith, Fred A. Fowlie
	of Fowlie’s Mills.  Dreams became visions.  Visions became
	reality.  An interview was arranged with Educational authorities at
	Fredericton”.  There was a plea put forth for assistance and
	encouragement to promote a larger school idea for the areas of Black
	River and Bay du Vin</i></p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify"><i>The
	officials were found most sympathetic.  The delegation came back
	encouraged and carried the plan to the people.    As a result, the
	six districts of Black River Bridge, Victoria. Little Branch, Bay
	Side, Bay du Vin River and Bay du Vin Beach decided to consolidate
	and join forces to establish the first Rural High School of the
	Province.</i></p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify"><i>A
	temporary School Board was appointed to carry on the construction.
	Rev. D. Smith was the chairman, A.M. Cameron,  vice–chairman,
	Harrison T. Smith, treasurer, Ian MacNaughton, secretary, Woodbury
	Williston, Bertrand Williston and Jack Godfrey as additional
	members”.</i></p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">Classes
	proved so popular that they had to relocate first to the church
	basement and later to the church hall across the road.  Smith also
	hired two additional teachers, Miss Elizabeth Stevenson and Mrs.
	Dorothy Claytonburg. 
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">On
	the opening of classes in September, 1939, still in Bay du vin,
	numbers had grown to 67 student, a Principal, Mr. A. T. Patstone and
	teachers, Miss Jean Barnes in Home Economics, and Miss Beryl
	MacAloney in academic subjects. 
	</p>
	<p align="justify">  
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify"><u><b>Construction</b></u></p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">Land
	for the new school was donated by, and across the road from the home
	of, Mr. Harrison T. Smith and actual construction commenced on
	September 19, 1939.  An undated but widely circulated paper by Mr.
	A. T. Patstone, the first principal, states:</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">“<i>The
	building was boarded in with clear Princess Pine, tongue and groove
	sheathing which was purchased for $75.00 per thousand.  The back
	wall towards the bay was double sheathed.  Strapping being placed
	over the first and then boarded in for the second time.  We
	considered this wall vulnerable to the northerlies which would sweep
	in from across the Bay with no let or hindrance.</i></p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify"><i>Wiring
	for the electric lights was done as if for 110 volt, hoping for the
	day when the ‘Hydro’ would arrive beyond Loggieville.  A heavy
	duty Delco lighting plant was installed and proved most efficient
	with its two banks of batteries, to provide the necessary wattage. 
	The furnace was forced hot air and the fan motor required a good
	strong system”.</i>
	 Coal was trucked from Kent County.</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">The
	program for the formal opening on Tuesday, October 1, 1940,
	identified the following as features of the school:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><p align="justify">Air-conditioned
		heating</p></li>
		<li><p align="justify">Pressure
		water system</p></li>
		<li><p align="justify">Green
		glare-proof Boards</p></li>
		<li><p align="justify">Modern
		plumbing</p></li>
		<li><p align="justify">Electric
		lights, Delco Plant</p></li>
	</ul>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">The
	new school cost, as I recall, $13,000 and opened in January 1940. 
	On a personal note, my first visit to MRHS was late in the fall of
	1939 when George Watling and biked down to see it.  It was an
	impressive building for a rural area.  As the photo above shows, it
	was two-story with two classrooms on each level at the front and an
	auditorium on the second floor at the back.  At the back on the
	lower floor were the principal’s office, boys and girls washrooms
	and the furnace room.</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">MRHS
	had electric lights, a 32 volt system, operated from a bank of
	glass-encased batteries with a small gasoline engine switching on
	and off automatically to charge the batteries. It also had a
	coal-fired furnace.  A very tall flagpole stood in the front yard by
	the driveway.  It looked like a ship’s mast and took a team of
	horses and special rigging to erect.</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">Classes
	were relocated to the new building, I believe, in January, 1940</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify"><u><b>Districts
	served</b></u></p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">Initially,
	MRHS drew its students from the following six one-room schools:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><p align="justify">Little
		Branch, 
		</p></li>

	<p align="justify"><u><b>Programs</b></u></p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">In
	the program for the opening of the new school, the aims of the new
	Miramichi Rural High School were given as:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><p align="justify"><i>To
		provide a satisfactory type of education, designed to meet the
		demands of the community and which will best fill the requirements
		of the individual</i></p></li>
		<li><p align="justify"><i>To
		foster and implant those habits of co-operation and economic
		practices necessary for complete living and for the formation and
		development of character.</i></p></li>
		<li><p align="justify"><i>To
		foster agricultural projects and to lend to the rural social
		activities of the community.</i></p></li>
	</ul>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">In
	addition to the usual subjects, offerings included home economics,
	shop and music; in fact, an orchestra had been formed by the fall of
	1940. In the early years, students were expected to plant school
	gardens.  It seems to me that we were paired and each pair had a
	small plot.  Come fall, the vegetables were canned and kept in the
	closet under the stairs</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">Educational
	programs for adults included weaving, adult discussion groups, music
	and games.  Readers are encouraged to read the paper, undated, by A.
	T. Patstone and included as Appendix 1.  
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify"><u><b>Transportation</b></u></p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">Attendance
	was not limited to Anglicans or to local students.  Students from
	Black River walked or biked to Bay du Vin during good weather and
	traveled by horse and sled in the winter; others boarded in Bay du
	Vin during the bad weather.   Norman Glendenning recalls
	transporting students to Bay du Vin by horse and sled and even to
	Bay Side after the new school was built.  During the day, his horse
	was stabled either at Goymer Williston’s or Harrison Smith’s
	barn; Norman always carried some hay and oats for the horse while it
	was stabled and had to tend to the animals during school break.</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">The
	first appears to have been provided by Goymer Williston in the back
	of a 2-3 ton truck with a box on the back</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">This
	was followed in the fall of 1940 by the bus shown below which Eddie
	Godfrey recalls as a one and one-half ton Fargo chassis purchased
	from the W.S.Loggie Co.  The body, I believe, was fabricated by the
	Fowlie Brothers of Little Branch.

	wartime colour); the third bus was a 21/2 ton Fargo, blue and white,
	built in Levis, PQ; their final bus was a 1947 International built
	in Saint John.  The Godfrey Bros. ended their business in 1955 and
	the remaining buses were sold.</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">When
	the Godfrey Bros. purchased their second bus, the one pictured above
	was sold to Gordon Dick of Upper Napan and used to transport
	students from Napan and Point aux Carr to school in Chatham.  Those
	communities were not part of the MRHS school district.</p>

	<p>It
	was the custom in the school system to hold an evening of music and
	entertainment just before Christmas and another, a graduation,
	towards the end of June.  The Christmas concert usually included one
	item from each of the district schools.   The following Christmas
	program is believed to have been presented in 1954 or 1955.</p>

	</p>
	<p>The
	Miramichi Rural High School operated as a unit until 1957 when both
	Home economics and shop classes were discontinued.  A decade later,
	a decision was taken to discontinue all high school classes at MRHS
	and for students to take their high school classes in Chatham. 
	During the same period, the surrounding one-room schools were phased
	out and students were accommodated in portable classrooms adjacent
	to the MRHS building.  A parcel of 8 acres of land adjoining the
	original site was purchased and, in 1987 and in xxx  “an excited
	group of staff and students moved into their new home”.  Shortly
	after, the original MRHS building was demolished and MRHS CEASED TO
	EXIST.</p>

	<p align="justify">Recollections
	of people associated with MRHS are welcomed with the following
	having been received to date:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><p align="justify">Ken,
		Norm and I were at the MRHS at the same time.  One teacher, perhaps
		Miss Hetherington, had both Norm and I in her classes.  She called
		Norm “Big Glendenning” and called me “Little Glendenning –
		Don Glendenning  
		</p></li>
	</ul>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<ul>
		<li><p align="justify">One
		trick was to place a paper cup full of water on the top edge of a
		classroom door.  When the door was opened, the cup of water tumbled
		down, hopefully on someone’s head.  Don Glendenning  
		</p></li>
	</ul>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<ul>
		<li><p align="justify">The
		boy’s toilet was constructed in such a way that there was a beam
		across the top of the entry to the section where the stalls were. 
		It was a great place to practice “chinning”.  - Don Glendenning
		 
		</p></li>
	</ul>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	<ul>
		<li><p align="justify">There
		a large covered bin in the boy’s washroom was used to store
		potatoes from the school garden - Don Glendenning  
		</p></li>
	</ul>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<ul>
		<li><p align="justify">Perley
		Quayle was a fine man and a good teacher but also a person who
		understood student pranks.  He had a Model A Coupe which he parked
		at the east end of the school.  We frequently moved it or turned it
		around.  - Don Glendenning  
		</p></li>
	</ul>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<ul>
		<li><p align="justify">One
		morning I missed the bus at the Little Branch corner and had to
		walk to school – about 3 miles.  Of course, I was late.  When I
		stepped into the school, I met Mr. Quayle.  I explained what had
		happened and then quipped “Better late than never” to which he
		responded ‘Yes, but better never late.” - Don Glendenning  
		</p></li>

	</p>
	<ul>
		<li><p align="justify">Lowell
		Williston had a wooden leg.  In the fall of 1939, there was an
		outbreak of scarlet fever.  The school health officer was a Dr.
		Loggie. When checking to see if people had a rash, one sign of
		scarlet fever, he would look at their backs, arms or legs.  He
		asked Lowell to pull up his pant leg; Dr. Loggie looked at his leg
		and pronounced him free of scarlet fever.  Lowell had a wooden leg.

	<ul>
		<li><p align="justify">Perley
		Quayle brought some of his own equipment to the school for our use.
		 One item was a huge lathe for wood turning.  It was operated like
		a treadle sewing machine.  He also set up a blacksmithing area in
		the coal bin and we learned to work – shaping, welding,
		annealing, tempering, etc.
