<p><b>HARLEY, JOHN</b>, ship carpenter and master builder, businessman, inspector of lights, harbormaster and JP; b. Courtmacsberry, Co. Cork, Ireland, 1800; m. 1829, Ann Coughlan, also a native of Ireland; d. Chatham Head, 26 Sep 1875.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The son of an Irish schoolmaster, John Harley came to the Miramichi around 1823 after a brother and sister had previously entered the province. He hired as a ship carpenter with William Abrams, for whom he was later master builder for more than twenty years. After Abrams died he became the master builder at Joseph Russell's yard on Beaubear's Island.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>In 1850, after Russell had given up his shipyard and lumber business in order to move to Utah, John Harley and George Burchill bought it for a fraction of its true value. During tbe next seven years they conducted woods operations, ran a sawmill, and built nine ships, all of whicb were sold in Britain. After their partnership was dissolved in 1857, Harley continued to build ships on the island with the help of his sons. In all, be is credited with having built sixty-two ships on the Miramichi, the last two in 1866. At around this time he lost the island to the Commercial Bank, to which it had been mortgaged some years previously. It was bought by Peter Mitchell in 1871.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Harley was commissioned a lieutenant in the 2nd Battalion of militia in 1836 and promoted to captain in 1846. He retired with this rank in 1864. He undertook numerous community responsibilities at the parish level and in 1855 was appointed a justice of the peace. In 1851 he was made one of the three commissioners of lights for the Gulf of St Lawrence. This led to his appointment by the federal government, after Confederation, as inspector of lights, buoys, and beacons in New Brunswick. He attended to this work until 1871, when he retired. Meanwhile, in 1867, he was appointed harbormaster, as successor to Alexander Goodfellow, and he retained this position until overtaken by illness in 1873.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>To quote the Union Advocate, Harley was "one of those sterling characters whom to know was to respect." He and his wife, Ann Coughlan, had three sons and two daughters. One of their daughters was Fanny Harley, the first wife of Charles Sargeant.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
