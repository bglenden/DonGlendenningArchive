  King&#x27;s Visit
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Two anecdotes related to British royalty. First is a childhood memory of stubbing his toe on a fence post stub in the lane—still remembered painfully. Main focus is the 1938/1939 visit of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth to Newcastle, when Don (age ~15-17) and about 20-25 others from Little Branch traveled by truck (possibly Smith family-owned) to witness the royals. Describes arriving early morning, standing throughout, and returning late evening singing. Includes the charming story of two sisters from Blackville/Boiestown photographing each other instead of the royal couple. Notes the Queen Mother&#x27;s later death prompted this recollection.</div>

<p><b>My sore toe</b><b></b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Presumably when Dad put up the concrete post, he widened the lane.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I recall the stub of a fence post sticking up a couple of inches or so in the middle of the lane.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I not only recall seeing it but also recall feeling it when I stubbed my toe.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It hurts yet when I think about it.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Queen Mother</b><span><b>=</b></span><b>s Birthday</b><b></b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The celebration of the Queen Mother<span>=</span>s birthday reminds me of the visit by the King and Queen to Newcastle in 1939.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We travelled to Newcastle in Hassie (?) Smith<span>=</span>s truck.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Or was it Harry or BW<span>=</span> truck?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As I recall, it was a sunny day and we were picked up at the Branch school about 5:30 am.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We stood in the back of the truck; I cannot recall who all was there but believe it included Ken, Norm, Roy, George, Harry MacLean, etc.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Probably 20 to 25 all together.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>We saw the King and Queen and then came home.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As I recall, Mum packed a lunch but I am not sure.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We arrived home sometime in late evening, singing all the way.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The King and Queen motored to Fredericton from Newcastle.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The story is told about the two sisters in Blackville or Boiestown who waited on the side of the road for the King and Queen to pass.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They has each bought a camera and film to ensure that at least one would get a photo.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Just before the Royal Party came along, the sisters decided that one should be on each side of the road so that, whichever way the Royal couple faced, they would have them in the photo.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The Royal couple drove past smiling and waving.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They had seen their beloved Monarch.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>They could hardly wait to have their photos developed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Imagine their surprise when they got their photos developed; they missed the<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>royal couple when they whizzed past but they had a great photo of each other.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Queen Mother</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The death of the Queen Mother brought to mind the visit of the King and Queen to Newcastle in 1938. The King and Queen came by train to Newcastle then went by car to Fredericton.</p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>A number of us from the Little Branch, maybe 15 or so?, went to Newcastle in the back of a big (3 ton) open truck.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It seems to me that the truck belonged Harry or “Hassie” Smith.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We were picked up very early in the morning and returned home fairly late in the evening although not after dark.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I think that we stood all the way; there were no benches to sit on.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was a beautiful sunny day; I am not sure what we would have done had it rained.</p>
