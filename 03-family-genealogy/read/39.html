<div class="reader-summary">Family Chronicle (No. 39, April 26, 2003) including undated photo of Don&#x27;s father Elmer and his lumber crew (assumed USA-based). Features reader follow-ups: Donald Edge&#x27;s memory of grandfather&#x27;s sawmill and pitch-covered hands; Earl Taylor&#x27;s similar experience at Fowlie&#x27;s mill; Shirley MacKay&#x27;s story of being flipped off a load of logs under a clothesline into a snowbank; and corrections about Uncle George&#x27;s locations (Tennessee, Virginia/Hampton, New Hampshire). Introduces &quot;The Woodcutter&quot; section describing family wood-cutting operations—seasonal harvesting of furnace and firewood, use of horse-drawn bobsleds, specialized equipment (circular saw, engine-driven), and community labor exchanges. Illustrates the interconnected rural economy and Don&#x27;s deep knowledge of traditional farm operations.</div>

	<b>Follow-up</b></p>
	<p style="orphans: 2; widows: 2"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="orphans: 2; widows: 2">The woods
	story brought back remem- brances to Donald Edge and Shirley MacKay.
	 Donald remembered working in his Grandfather’s sawmill pulling
	off the slabs and cutting them into firewood.  By the end of the
	day, his hands would be nearly stuck shut because of the pitch from
	the wood.  When Earl Taylor worked at Fowlies’s mill and stayed at
	home, he was also covered with pitch at the end of the day.</p>
	<p style="orphans: 2; widows: 2"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="orphans: 2; widows: 2"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="orphans: 2; widows: 2">Donald also
	remembered the spruce gum, which was a ball of hardened sap of a
	spruce 
	</p>
	<p style="orphans: 2; widows: 2">tree.  It was
	a real treat.  Donald still has his fathers spruce gum box.  
	</p>
	<p style="orphans: 2; widows: 2"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="orphans: 2; widows: 2">Shirley
	remembered going to the woods with her uncle, Johnnie MacKay.  On
	the way home, she as allowed to sit on the load of logs.  When her
	Uncle reached the yard, he had to go under the clothesline to where
	he was piling the wood.  The clothesline caught Shirley, flipped her
	through the air into a snow bank.  She survived without injury.</p>
	<p style="orphans: 2; widows: 2"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="orphans: 2; widows: 2">As a
	follow-up to mention of family members in the USA, Tina Newton
	thinks that Uncle George worked in both Tennessee and Virginia
	(Hampton).  A couple of people mentioned dancing the lancer at the
	Black River Hall.  Thanks to Donald Edge for pointing out that there
	is an <br />
Armstrong School in Hampton, Virginia but not in North
	Haven Connecticut.  That is more likely where my sister Grace went
	to school.</p>
	<p style="orphans: 2; widows: 2"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="orphans: 2; widows: 2"><b>The
	Woodcutter</b></p>
	<p style="orphans: 2; widows: 2"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="orphans: 2; widows: 2">Our family
	worked in the woods in the winter cutting furnace and firewood for
	the following winter.  This allowed the wood to dry before it was
	burned.    Sometimes they also cut logs for lumber.  Most of our
	wood was cut on the “ridge”, a slight rise towards the back of
	the farm; hardwood needed dry ground.  Our hardwood was mostly beech
	and maple with some birch.  Trees were cut and hauled in long
	lengths on bobsleds and piled just above our house.  Come late
	March, as I recall, the wood was blocked into 16-inch lengths for
	the stove and 24 inches for the furnace.</p>
	<p style="orphans: 2; widows: 2"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="orphans: 2; widows: 2">Not all
	families did this and they ended up burning green wood.  The story
	is told that at one of the MacDonald’s, perhaps it was Aunt Kate
	Ken, didn’t have any wood to burn so she prepared the vegetables
	and set them on the stove.  When her husband came home. There was no
	hot supper.  From then on there was always dry wood to burn.</p>
	<p style="orphans: 2; widows: 2"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="orphans: 2; widows: 2">We had a
	woodcutter and engine; it may have been owned jointly with Uncle Jim
	Watling.    The engine was a medium sized “one-lunger”, a single
	piston with a magneto to provide the spark.  It was sometimes hard
	to start but I will say more about the engine another time.</p>
	<p style="orphans: 2; widows: 2"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="orphans: 2; widows: 2">The
	woodcutter was a frame about 8 or 10 feet long with a circular saw
	driven by a belt fastened to an engine.  The saw turned very fast. 
	Behind the saw was a table on which the long wood was placed and
	then pushed into the saw thus cutting it into short lengths.  A wood
	cutter crew consisted of two people to throw blocks, three people to
	handle the wood on the table, two people at the woodpile bringing
	the wood forward and placing the butt end near the saw, and two
	people who lifted the logs and moved them forward to the table as
	they were needed.  Some of our hardwood would have been 15 inches or
	more in diameter had to be turned to cut in from both sides.  On
	some of the heavy sticks, the engine would slow down and the table
	had to be pulled back to let the saw gain speed.</p>
	<p style="orphans: 2; widows: 2"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="orphans: 2; widows: 2">Neighbours
	usually helped each other with the woodcutter.  Sometimes extra men
	would be required.  I remember being wakened about 6:30 am to go
	across the crust to Adams’ or Harper farm to see if we could get
	an extra person to help.  Presumably the extra people were paid.</p>
	<p style="orphans: 2; widows: 2"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="orphans: 2; widows: 2">In 1947, I
	was teaching at Kouchibouguac and came home on a weekend when the
	woodcutter was at home.  I was dragooned into throwing blocks all
	day.  They were heavier than the pencil I was used to.  I remember
	yet how sore I was the next day.</p>
