<p>			The death of William MacKenzie of Lower Napan, occurred at Victoria Public Hospital, Fredericton on Friday, March 29. Mr. MacKenzie had been in failing health for some time, and had undergone surgery and treatment for several weeks at the hospital.</p>

<p>			When quite a young man, he left home and friends and went to the Klondyke fields during the early days of the gold rush.

Also several grandchildren.</p>
<p>			</p>
<p>			Mr. MacKenzie was well known throughout a large area. He was keenly interested in agricultural work and in the betterment of community life, a good neighbour and always ready to render assistance to anyone who met unfortunate circumstances. He will long be remembered by those who knew him.</p>
<p>			</p>
<p>			His funeral, which was one of the largest ever seen in the community was held on Sunday, Mar. 31, from Carmel United Church at Lower Napan. Rev. T. Constable conducted the service and internment was in St. Stephenís cemetery, Black River Bridge.</p>
