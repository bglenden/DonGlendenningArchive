</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Charming recollection of childhood games and pastimes in Black River, including Anti-I-Over (a team ball game played over buildings), buckety wade (teeter-totter), homemade darts made from cork and horseshoe nails, and the card game Flinch which was unique to the Glendenning family. Don credits his sister Grace with introducing Flinch via a Parker Brothers game sent from Salem, Massachusetts. Also describes snow-crust skating and coasting with a humorous incident of his front wheel dropping through.</div>

<p><b>Anti-I-Over?</b><b></b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Donald Edge was trying to recall the name of a game played by youngsters in Black River.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was, I believe, Anti-I-Over although I am not sure of the correct spelling.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>It was played between two teams separated by a building – usually the house, the barn or a large shed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>One team would throw the ball over the building – anywhere along the roof.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The other team would wait for the ball to appear and would try to catch it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If not successful, they threw the ball back over.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If successful in catching the ball, team members would run around the building and attempt to catch (hit the other team with the ball.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If they did, they won.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>This is my recollection of the rules of the game but I would welcome comments.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>What’s a “buckety wade?</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>I am not sure of the word or it’s spelling but didn’t we call a teeter-totter a buckety wade?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Seems that we made ours with a 2x6 plank over a fence or gate, or perhaps a sawhorse. (A 2x4 was not strong enough.)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In order to balance the plank, the lighter person would move a bit closer to the end of the plank.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A great demonstration of one of the laws of physics</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Flinch</b></p>
<p><b>Follow-up</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Donna (Russell) Goodfellow confirms that their flinch Game came from my sister, Grace.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I must now conclude that Flinch was a game unique to our family.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Parker Brothers still sells the game; I bought two games yesterday.</p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>Flinch was a very popular game at our home.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Although I played it, I especially remember a crowd of young people, only the boys I think, gathered around our dining room table of an evening.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I remember the Harpers, Adams and our own crew and I think Roy and Win and others. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Flinch is played with one or more packs of cards; cards are numbered from one to 15.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>One has a hand, a flinch pile where you lay down a card at the end of your turn and a stack of cards from which players take new hands.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The objective is to get rid of your flinch pile first.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If you had a card in your flinch pile and did not play it, you were flinched – that is, the player who spotted it gave you a card from his pile.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I know that we played it at home, Venetia played it with her family, Ken and his family played it and probably others.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Flinch was first produced by the Flinch Card Company in Kalamazoo, Mich.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>in 1902.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Parker Brothers produced it under license from 1904, and later bought the rights.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was produced in Canada under license by Copp Clark Co. Ltd.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The Museum of Games at Waterloo University bought a copy of the game in 1979.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I’ve asked a number of people and Flinch seems to have been unique to our family.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My game was produced by Parker Brothers in Salem, Mass.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Doreen (Glendenning) Nicol suggested that the game came to us from my sister, Grace, who lived at one time in Salem and who probably sent it as a Christmas gift.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Makes sense.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Carol and I spent Christmas in Ottawa; I took my Flinch game along.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Carol, Doreen, Janet and I played Flinch – <b>and enjoyed it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span></b>I wonder if any readers remember the game.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Darts</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>We sometimes played darts.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Not having a proper cork dartboard, we played against a barn door or wood wall. Neither did we have darts so we made our own.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>To make a dart, one followed these easy steps:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Find a bottle cork – I cannot recall which household items came in bottles with cork but in our house, it was not wine.</p>
<p>Sharpen a horseshoe nail.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A horseshoe nail was square, slender and pointed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A bit of filing helped.</p>
<p>Push the nail through the cork from the larger diameter to the smaller diameter.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Be careful not to split the cork.</p>
<p>Find two matching wing feathers from hens - preferably feathers that the hen had discarded although I know of feathers having been forcibly removed from a reluctant hen.</p>
<p>Push the quill, end of a feather, into the large end of the cork on either side of the head of the horseshoe nail.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Again, this step often resulted in splitting the cork.</p>
<p>Try the dart turning the feathers as needed to ensure a smooth flight.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span>Exercise extreme caution that no one is nearby when throwing darts.</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>The Crust</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><i>I was out to the woods recently and was able to walk on the crust – at least where there was still some shade.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The crust refers to the frozen top inch or two of the snow and was common in the springtime but could occur at other times after a mild spell.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Temperatures at night would be below freezing but the days would warm up and the snow, and ground showing through it, would soften up.</i></p>
<p><i></i><br></p>
<p><i>The crust was great for coasting, and for taking a short cut when visiting neighbours.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>One could even bicycle on the crust although it was often tricky.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I recall one incident when riding towards home from the Branch corner and my front wheel dropped through the crust and threw me off.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The crust was also great for coasting; unfortunately it usually marked the end of the coasting season.</i></p>
