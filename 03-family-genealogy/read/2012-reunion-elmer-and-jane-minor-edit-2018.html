<span lang="en-GB">Elmer
was the second child and first son of Walter and Elizabeth (Peters)
Glendenning.  He was born in Canobie on </span>land
that is now a grove of trees directly across the road from the
Canobie School, now the Women’s Institute Hall.

It
is likely that he went to the one room school, now long gone, located
on a corner of his Uncle John’s farm next door.  T<span lang="en-GB">he
family seems to have valued education; his grandmother having been a
teacher lived in the home after his Grandfather died.  As further
evidence, his brother, Chip took a business course, Guy studied but
did not finish dentistry and Margaret trained as a nurse.  Other
family records suggest that he may have taken some technical courses,
probably at night in Portland, Maine.  It is known that his oldest
sister, Venetia, provided a home for his sister, Margaret, so that
she could finish high school in Portland and likely did the same for
her brother, Guy, as well.   </span>

<p align="justify" style="orphans: 0; font-style: normal; widows: 0">
<span lang="en-GB">Elmer’s
father was a farmer and, judging by the amount of land accumulated, a
successful one at that.  Elmer, and all the boys, and maybe even the
girls, would be expected to do their share.  Since the homestead was
an original grant, the land would have to be cleared of trees, and
those who know Canobie, will remember the stony fields; and all the
work would be done by hand or with the aid of horses.</span></p>
<p lang="en-GB" align="justify" style="orphans: 0; font-style: normal; widows: 0">
<br />

</p>
<p lang="en-GB" style="font-style: normal">It
was not uncommon at the time for New Brunswickers to go to the North
Eastern USA during the winter to work in the woods and then return to
farm and fish in the summer and Elmer may have even done that
himself.  We also know, for example, that his Aunt, Mary Ann Harley,
who had married a Stevens and lived next door in Canobie, had moved
to Portland to be with family after her husband died in 1870.  
Records show that the Glendennings were well established in Portland
in the first decade of the 1900s. Frank moved there in 1898 and Elmer
by 1901. Venetia lived in Falmouth Foreside which is between Portland
and Freeport.  Other siblings known to have lived in Portland, at
least for a while, include Margaret, Raymond and Guy.   In addition,
Maude and her husband, Jim Cormier lived in Lincoln, New Hampshire
and Leonard and his family lived in Maine.  He also had a number of
first, and likely second, cousins living in Portland as well.  At the
same time, Canobie must have continued to tug on Elmer’s loyalty
since land grant records show that Lot # 28 in Canobie, 100 acres,
was granted to “Atton” E. Glendenning on 1901-07-06.  .</p>

<span lang="en-GB">Elmer,
his brother, Frank, and likely brothers Chip, Ray and Guy, operated a
cartage business, horses and wagons, under the name Glendenning Bros.
&amp; Co. (All Kinds of Team Work) at 24 Hammond Street. They had
horses and wagons and did all kinds of hauling.  Portland was the
terminus of the Great Northern Railway, later the CNR, which meant
that goods of all kinds had to be moved from trains and ships to
warehouse and later to retail stores and homes.  One role Dad told
about was that of delivering ice to homes. In winter, his horses and
crews were shipped to New Hampshire, but possibly also to Vermont and
Maine to cut and haul wood on the mountainside.  </span>

<span lang="en-GB">Jane
was the second youngest of a family of eight born to Jubal Watling
and Grace MacAskill MacDonald, born, presumably at home, at the
Meadows, Upper Black River, New Brunswick.  She was named after Jane
Elizabeth Jardine, a neighbour at the Meadows, who married Donald
Cameron.  Her Grandfather, also Jubal, had come from England in 1830,
had lived for a few years in Prince Edward Island before moving,
along with some siblings, to Black River where he married a
neighbour, Christina MacNaughton.  We do not know much about the
family; presumably they had a small mixed farm but family lore
suggests that Jubal, and maybe others, worked in the shipbuilding
trade along the Miramichi.  Jane attended the Upper Black River
School as did her siblings, for the first 3-4 years.  In later years,
she recalled her concern about bears when walking to and from school.</span></p>

<p align="justify" style="orphans: 0; font-style: normal; widows: 0">
<span lang="en-GB">As
best we can tell, the family moved, when Jane was 11 years old, from
the Meadows to Little Branch in 1901.  The move came about when after
her Grandfather MacDonald died and her Grandmother was not able to
look after herself.  The family may well also have been influenced
also by being close to both school, Little Branch, and church, St.
Stephen’s Presbyterian, which played an important role in the life
of the family.  It is likely that Jane attended the Little Branch
School although we do not know for sure.     </span>

A

employment.  George was there in 1901, Janet worked at the Waltham
watch factory, Jim worked for a number of years in a chemists/
photography shop in Portland, Jack worked in the Boston area,

arrived in Portland just prior to her 18th birthday.   She arrived at
the train station in Portland in the early morning of January 24,
1908 and waited for her brother, George, to meet her. Apparently, he
came to the station but did not recognize her; she had grown up while
he was away from Black River.  </span>

lived with his family in Canobie after her mother died.  Millie was
married to Adam MacLean from Black River who Jane would have known,
and they had two sons at the time of her Jane’s arrival.  We also
know that, less than three weeks after Janes arrival in Portland,
Elmer’s father died on February 14, 1908 while visiting family;
Jane looked after Millie’s two sons while Millie attended the
funeral. We also know that a number of Jane’s siblings worked for
Elmer at one time or another.  </span><span lang="en-GB"><span style="font-weight: normal">So,

couple returned to Portland (Bonny Eagle) after the wedding.  From
Jane’s autograph album we learn that friends gathered on December
1, 1910, to congratulate them on their recent marriage but also to
wish them well on their plans to move to Tennessee where Elmer would
take up work on a new hydroelectric dam then being built on the Ocoee
River at Parksville.  An entry in Jane’s household record book
reads: </span><span lang="en-GB"><i>&quot;Commenced

<span lang="en-GB">On
completion of the second dam, Ocoee #2, in either late 1913 or early
1914, the couple purchased the Jessie Macdonald property and returned
to Little Branch to live.  Shortly after their return, Elmer was
appointed Postmaster of the Little Branch Post Office.  Two years
later, however, Elmer resigned as Postmaster and returned to heavy
construction work, first to North Haven, Connecticut where daughter
Lillian was born, and later to short stints in Abiline, Texas;
Hampton, Virginia and Mussel Shoals, Alabama.  While living in
Hampton, Virginia a new daughter, Margaret Virginia, was added to the

<span lang="en-GB">The
original house, owned by Miss Jessie MacDonald, Janes Great Aunt, was
a traditional “story and a half” with a gable roof and built end
on to the road – the right side of the home shown below.  By 1920,
they had five children and the house must have been very crowded. 
Soon, likely in the early 1920’s, the ell shown on the left side of
the house was added.  Most if not all of the lumber for the addition
was cut on the property, including a hardwood for the floor and pine
for pantry cabinets   the barn was also enlarged by doubling its
length and adding a shed at the back and included stalls for five
horses, a new set of large doors to a new “barn floor”, haymow,
and some pigpens.  At some point a machinery shed and workshop was
added to the west end of the barn, and a henhouse and grain shed were
built as separate buildings.  And of course, one must not forget the
two-hole outdoor privy.</span></p>

<span lang="en-GB">During
his lifetime, Elmer purchased a number of small farms in the area, a
farm for each son. Farms were “mixed”, that is, they usually
included such cows, pigs, sheep, hens, geese, horses, turkeys; crops
included a farm garden, oats, barley, wheat, buckwheat, and hay.  As
a result, income, or other goods through trade, was obtained from
eggs, chickens, beef, pork, the sale of weaners (Piglets four to six
weeks old), geese, turkeys, ducks, bales of hay, bags of grain,
cream, potatoes, furnace wood, and butter, etc.  In addition, it
ensured that the family had meat and potatoes for their own use. 
Elmer had a team of oxen which he used around the farm.  </span>

was active in the community including the building of St. Paul's
Presbyterian Church (on June 14, 1926 was elected to the first Board
of Managers, was Secretary Treasurer during of the construction of
the Black River Community Hall.  He was active in the Orange Lodge,
Odd fellows, and Masons. He was a founding member of an Agricultural
Society (#103) and was its Secretary Treasurer for fourteen years.
Both were tireless workers in support of St. Paul’s Presbyterian
Church dedicated in 1930.</span></p>

After
28 years of marriage, Jane Elizabeth Jardine (Watling) became a widow
in 1938; she was 48 at the time.  The two oldest daughters, Grace and
Venetia, were married and living elsewhere; her daughter, Lillian,
was living and working in the Boston area.  Elinor and the five boys,
the youngest being nine years old, were living at home.</p>

<span lang="en-GB">The
next decade, the wartime years, brought a number of significant
changes to the community including the construction of the Miramichi
Rural High School, the construction of an airbase at Chatham, a radar
station at St. Margaret’s, and a bombing range on the road to
Loggieville.  These developments meant a significant growth of
non-farm jobs for the community.  The outbreak of hostilities also
soon resulted in sons, sons-in-law, neighbours, relatives and friends
entering the armed forces.  The decade also brought improved roads,
regular bus service to Chatham and electric lights.  By the end of
the decade, Black River had moved from a barter to a cash economy.</span></p>

continued to be active in the community generally and encouraged her
family and others to do the same.  She was especially active in her
church, the Women’s Missionary Society, the Presbyterian League and
the Women’s Institute.  She believed in education and supported the
construction of a high school for the area; she also encouraged her
family and others to continue their schooling.  </span>Mother
loved to have visitors.  There were a half-dozen of us at every meal
and putting up a meal for 15 after church on Sunday, or any other
day, did not faze her a bit or if it did, she did not let on.  I
cannot ever even once remember her saying, I wish they hadn’t or
wouldn’t come today.  Meals were not fancy but they were always
tasty.  Of course, when the visitors were family, the daughters or
daughters-in-law, pitched in to help.

until she died in 1964. In reporting her death, the Chatham Gazette
noted, “she took a keen interest in community activities and was
especially interested in education.”  At her death, the family farm
passed to her son, Norman and his wife Jean, who continued to welcome
family to the old homestead.</span></p>
