  Shuttle Grandma&#x27;s 
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">An expanded, more detailed version of the shuttle narrative (FILE 13), dated March 14, 2016, providing deeper historical context. Includes information about William Harley in Courtmacsherry, County Cork, Ireland, and the family&#x27;s 1820s migration. Describes the weaving trade in pioneer Canobie, where John Glendinning operated one of the first looms. Provides technical description of the shuttle (12 x 1 1/8 x 7/8 inches, walnut wood, with tapered pirn). Traces object&#x27;s path through Venetia (in Maine/Florida) to Cornelia to Don. Deeper genealogical and material culture documentation than FILE 13.</div>

Great Great Grandfather, William Harley was born in Worcester,
England but moved to Courtmacsherry, County Cork, Ireland, before the
turn of the century where William was believed to have been a school
master.  All five children (2 boys and 3 girls) came to New Brunswick
in the 1820’s; one daughter, Margaret (1803-1895), married John
Glendinning in 1833 settling first at Salmon Beach and later in
Canobie.  (The change from Glendinning to Glendenning came, I
believe, with the granting of lots to John and Walter Glendenning
about 1856).   </b></span><span lang="en-US"><u><b>Pioneer Settlers</b></u></span><span lang="en-US"><b>,
a history of Canobie, tells us that early settlers had sheep,  spun
their own wool and wove cloth; it also tells us that John Glendinning
had one of the first “weaving machines” (looms) in Canobie and
the Glendinnings taught many in  the community to weave. </b></span>

<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><span lang="en-US"><b>Weaving
involves the use of a loom to interlace threads at right angles to
each other.  The threads running the length of the cloth form the
warp; the threads running across the warp are known as the weft.  The
weft thread is carried back and forth across the warp by a shuttle
holding a bobbin or on a small rod called a pirn.  Grandma’s
shuttle measures 12 x 11/8 x7/8, in excellent condition and is made
of a dark wood believed to be walnut. It has a tapered, “threaded”
pirn, and a hole through one side for the thread to unravel.</b></span></p>

<span lang="en-US"><b>The shuttle was brought to Canada from Ireland
by my Great Grandmother, Margaret (Harley) Glendenning in the
1820’s.; it may have been given as a gift or may even have been
given to the youngest daughter on leaving the family nest as a family
heirloom.  The shuttle passed to Margaret’s granddaughter, Venetia,
who lived in Falmouth, Foreside, Maine for a number of years before
moving to Bowling Green, Florida; Venetia gave the shuttle to her
niece, Cornelia (Glendenning) Traetta of Ormond Beach, Florida, who
gave it to me.  The shuttle is now in PEI but will be donated to the
New Brunswick Museum.</b></span></p>
