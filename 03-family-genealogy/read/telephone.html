<div class="reader-summary">Describes telephone service in Black River during Don&#x27;s childhood, contrasting the New Brunswick Telephone Company serving Black River with the &#x27;Government line&#x27; serving areas down river to Escuminac. Details party line communication (exchange 1900, ring 4), battery-powered phones, and community dynamics of shared phone service. Recounts anecdotes including neighbors using their phone for emergencies, people eavesdropping for news, and a notable story of a neighbor who tied the receiver to her rocking chair. Reflects early 20th-century rural communication infrastructure.</div>

<p><b>Telephone Service</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Black River was served primarily by the New Brunswick Telephone Company; on the other side of the Little Branch River and all the way to Escuminac, phone service was provided by the “Government line”. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The Government Line always seemed to be out of order.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That meant that people from down river frequently came to our house to use the phone; that also meant that emergency phone calls often came to our place with a request that they be delivered.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I cannot ever remember delivery being refused.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In fact, I remember delivering a phone message to someone up Bay du Vin River over very wet, muddy and rutted spring roads.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Ours was a party line; our number was 1900-4 – nineteen hundred ring four.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Nineteen hundred was the exchange; 4 was the ring.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When the phone rang four short rings, we knew to pick it up.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Double-digit numbers were rung by dialing long and short rings.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Number twenty-four, for example, would be two long rings and four short rings.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The phone itself was a box about 10 inches wide, 20 inches high and six inches deep.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The receiver hung on a y-hook; you lifted the receiver off the hook and held it to your ear.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The phone was battery powered – two C batteries as I recall. Once or twice a year, telephone maintenance men changed the batteries.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>When the phone rang, it was possible to pick up the phone and listen to both sides of the conversation.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This was a great way to catch up on the news and prevented secrets in the community.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In case of an emergency, such as a fire, a continuous ring would be heard to alert the neighbours.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The story is told of a neighbour who tied the receiver to her rocking chair each time she sat down to rest.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The Telephone Company threatened to disconnect a phone if someone listened in on a conversation although I never heard of that happening except in the above instance.</p>
