  AGRICULTURAL SOCIETY
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Don documents Agricultural Society No. 103 serving Black River and area farmers. **Father Elmer was Secretary-Treasurer for 18 years; oldest brother Walter succeeded him for another 18 years; two other brothers served as Directors.** Society functioned as bulk-purchasing cooperative handling lime, fertilizer, grass seed, pesticides, binder twine. Father maintained society shed (14x22 feet). Don recalls winter canvassing farmers, rail delivery logistics, unloading crews. **Documents his father&#x27;s death spring 1938 and Walter&#x27;s succession.** Reflects on Agricultural Societies&#x27; gradual replacement by cooperatives.</div>

<p><b>AGRICULTURAL SOCIETY</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Agricultural Society No. 103 provided an important service to the farmers of Black River and points east.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The society, as well as sister organizations throughout the Province gradually were absorbed in or replaced by agricultural cooperatives.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Their story deserves to be told but, unfortunately, still remains hidden.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Perhaps it has particular significance for me because my father was Secretary Treasurer for 18 years, my oldest brother followed in his footsteps for another 18 years and two other brothers served as Directors.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>An Agricultural Society was like a Co-op although members did not own shares.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Farmers at the community level banded together and bought agricultural supplies in bulk and resold them, at a slight profit, to local farmers.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As I recall, the Society handled such things as lime, fertilize, grass seed and perhaps some of turnips, mangles and xx.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Initially fertilizers, nitrogen, potash and phosphate, were purchased separately and mixed by each farmer but later fertilizer was purchased premixed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Seems to me that they also handled some agricultural pesticides or herbicides such as Paris Green and xx.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Perhaps the Society even handled binder twine (which came in wrapped bundles of six or eight rolls each.)</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>During the winter, farmers were canvassed as to their needs for the coming planting season; their needs aggregated and then orders were placed. Lime and fertilizer was ordered by the ton (by the boxcar) either loose or bagged.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It came to the railroad station in Loggieville (about 11 miles from where I lived) and farmers came individually with their teams and truck wagons, loaded what they had ordered, and moved it to their respective farms.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Sometimes it was taken loose and other times it was bagged; taking it loose was cheaper.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When the lime or fertilizer “came in”, farmers awaiting their supply, were phoned and to come for their orders.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It had to be picked up quickly otherwise there was a daily charge by the railroad for keeping the car from further use.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The Secretary Treasurer also organized a crew of men to d do the unloading; in my time it was Walter, John, Ken and Norm plus others from the community as needed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was both heavy and dirty work; I was glad to miss it. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Other supplies were smaller in quantity and were usually picked up at the Loggieville Station by Dad or one of the family and stored temporarily in the shed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I remember the bags of timothy, red and alsike clover.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Just before planting, farmers came and picked up their supply.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Depending on the amount, seeds were bagged in brown paper bags, weighed, tied with a string, labeled and sold.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The key was to order sufficient supplies for the season but to maintain a minimum inventory.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>As Secretary Treasurer, my father maintained the agricultural society shed, the place where agricultural suppose were stored.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The shed itself was a tidy but weather beaten building roughly 14 by 22 with a pitched roof and a window at each en.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The shed was located in and parallel to our driveway with the large door located for easy access to wagons when they drove past.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br>
As Secretary Treasurer, my father also kept the books. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The only auditor I recall was Johnnie McKnight.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And I remember him coming to the house and going over the books.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When he finished, he inscribed the following: “Audited and found correct, John C. McKnight”.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>y the west side of the lane across from our back door.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Dad was the Secretary Treasurer and operated the shed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I remember seeing the bags of timothy and clover, red and alsike as well as alfalfa. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Farmers would order the amount of each they wanted and then mix their own.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>My father died in the spring of 1938 and my brother, Walter, became the Secretary Treasurer.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When Walter married and moved to his own home about two miles away, the shed also moved.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I remember the men jacking up the shed and putting extra long bunks on the bobsled to carry the weight of the shed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Then one morning, after a light snowstorm, a team of horses was hitched to the bobsleds and the shed was taken to its new location.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When Walter left Black River, I believe that Harry Watling became Secretary Treasurer and the shed was move again. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>With the recent passing of Harry Watling, I was reminded of the Agricultural Society #103.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I do not know the history of agricultural societies generally or of the one in Black River but hopefully someone will prepare their history some day.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I’ve often wondered what happened to all the old records.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I was told once that the books had been turned over to the Agricultural office in Chatham.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I think that there were other agricultural societies in Napan and beyond but none east of Black River.</p>
