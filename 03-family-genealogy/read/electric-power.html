  Electric Power
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Don documents the arrival of electricity to Black River in fall 1948. His mother had the house wired in advance by Harry Simmonds; Don recalls coming home from his teaching position at Miramichi Rural High School to see the house lit for the first time. His brother Norman installed an electric water pump at Christmas 1948 and a hot water heater Christmas 1949, with Don assisting and later helping install a water line to the barn (dug 5 feet deep, 1950-1951) using a float-chamber system. Includes memory of his mother&#x27;s electric iron, kept in storage during prior years when his father worked at hydroelectric dam projects with electricity access.</div>

<p><b>Electric Power</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>Electric power came, as I recall, to Black River in the fall of 1948.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The hydro poles had been put in and wires strung the year before.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Mum had the house wired, I think, by Harry Simmonds, months before power was turned on.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I was teaching at the Miramichi at the time and remember coming home from school, probably in September or October, and looking up the hill to see the house lighted for the first time.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Seems to me that Norm put in an electric water pump that Christmas and a hot water heater the following Christmas (1949).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I remember helping with both.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He also ran a water line to the barn, dug about by hand 5 feet deep either in 1950 or 1951.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The reason I remember the latter is that I was at NBIT at the time and had a float chamber made in the welding shop.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We used a toilet valve to control the water level and a couple of light bulbs as a float.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The float chamber was located near the entrance from the cowbarn to the barn floor and a pipe run along the stalls.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was gravity fed to the individual drinking bowls.</p>

<p><b>The Electric Iron</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>During the first years of their married life, Dad worked at construction sites, usually dam sites as far as I know.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Some of the sites had electricity, probably to power some of the equipment but also available to the homes where the families lived.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As a result, Mum had an electric iron among things stored in the closet at the head of the stairs (the equivalent of the attic in novels and movies).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Sometimes on a stormy wintry day, I was allowed to root around in the attic.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That’s where the electric iron was kept.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Before the advent of wrinkle free or wrinkle resistant fabric, most clothing required pressing.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>(Even men’s dress pants were pressed from time to time.)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Irons<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>for pressing usually came in sets of three and were warmed on the stovetop.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A detachable handle was used to change irons when a hot one was needed. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Ironing was a necessary and frequent task when raising a family of nine – and I understand that Walter always wore a white shirt when courting Agnes and he courted most nights of the week.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Anyway, with the arrival of electricity, the old iron was retrieved from the closet, plugged and provided a number of additional years of useful service.</p>
<p><br></p>

<p>Quite a change from there to carving out a homestead at the Meadows in the mid-1800s</p>
