<p><b>Along the Black River</b></p>
<p><b>March 30, 2021</b><b></b></p>
<p><b>Draft 2</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>This is not a history of Black River but rather random notes that I have gathered as part of my genealogical research.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>While I include some notes on the early years, the focus is really on the period just before WW2.</p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>The Black River</b></p>
<p>The Black River is about 8 miles south of Chatham, New Brunswick and originates in the forests between Barnaby River and Rogersville.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Like most rivers in the eastern part of the Province, the Black River flows from west to east, then it turns northward near its mouth and empties into Bay du Vin, which is part of the Miramichi River estuary.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>From thence it flows into the Gulf of St. Lawrence and on to the Atlantic Ocean.<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>The Eastern boundary of the Black River was the Victoria Bridge near its mouth although technically the river extends beyond the bridge before melding with the waters of the Bay du Vin. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>The Black River has many tributaries the largest being the Little Black River, better known as Little Branch which joins the Black River not far from its mouth.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The other tributary of note, because it is also settled, is Wells Brook also shown in some early documents as Walls Bro<b>ok.</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>A Brief History</b></p>
<p>The first settlers were United Empire Loyalists who, after the American Revolution of 1776, sailed north along the New England coast and, for the most part, entered the Bay of Fundy landing at Saint John, New Brunswick.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Many moved up the Saint John River with some crossing to the east coast via the upper reaches of the Miramichi; others came directly to the Miramichi.<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Loyalists were soon followed by settlers from the old country - most were Scottish and Presbyterian.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>After six to eight weeks on the ocean, they set foot in the New World.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Some, after an initial settlement elsewhere in the Maritimes, found their way to the Miramichi to work in shipbuilding.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Once on the Miramichi, exploration and settlement developed on its tributaries including the Black River.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>From the Miramichi, settlers pushed into the Black River and its tributaries around 1800; once there, they climbed its banks and, finding a level spot, unpacked their belongings and had a bite to eat.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Then they pitched their tents and began to develop permanent homes among the virgin timber.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The land was heavily forested and the first task would be to make a clearing and prepare lodging for the coming winter.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Initial homes were made of logs cut on the property by hand; crevices between the logs were stuffed with moss to keep out the cold and snow.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Logs not needed were used for firewood; the remainder was burned.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>With the arrival of warm weather, the first seeds, many brought with them - including wheat, oats, corn, beans, etc - potatoes and other garden vegetables were planted and harvested among the stumps - and all by hand.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>By winter, a root cellar had been built to keep vegetables from freezing during the long winters.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>A cow and a pig were purchased from neighbours in the nearest community and a shed provided for their shelter - a horse would be added later.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In time houses became homes, roads were constructed, then churches and schools, and the community of Black River became a reality.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Transportation between settlements was mainly by boat hence the fact that initial homes were located near the riverbank.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Settlers would make the occasional trip by boat to Loggieville for supplies.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Later, commercial boats carried passengers and supplies dropping them off at various locations along the coast often taking fish on the return trip.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The dates on which grants were made also reflect the fact that, in the case of Black River, settlement proceeded up the river from its mouth. Adjacent lands along at Hexham and in Miramichi (Bayside) were granted in the 1780's and 1790's; settlers began to spread up the Black River, at least along the south side, after the turn of the century. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Initially blazed paths, and eventually roads were made between communities. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p><span><b></b></span><br></p>
<p><span><b>The people</b></span></p>
<p>By 1939, there were about 120 households along the Black River and its tributaries, two churches, a burial ground, four schools and a community hall.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was a stable, hard working and God-fearing community where people made their living from the land, sea and forests.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But it was a community starting to change. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The old family names predominated - MacDonald, MacNaughton, Godfrey, McGraw, MacDougall, Watling, Fowlie, Cameron - although there was a sprinkling of newcomers.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Conflict in Europe soon called its sons and daughters to serve in the armed forces but also to the plants producing goods and services for a country at war.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Although most returned from the war, many returning veterans as well as those engaged in the industries of war no longer made Black River their home.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Most returned; some did not. Some returnees continued to make Black River there home but many became part of the great movement from country to city and from fields, farms and woods to factories in central Canada<b>.</b></p>
<p><span><b></b></span><br></p>
<p><b>The Economy</b></p>
<p>The Black River area was, and to a large extent still is, heavily forested with black, red and white spruce and balsam fir, some pine, white and yellow birch, maple, beech and a scattering of ash.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>While the forests were and continue to be significant, Black River began to switch from forestry to farming earlier than some of its neighbouring communities. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Early settlers spent much of their time eking out a living.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Lumber and fish appear to have been the first cash crops.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Shipbuilding and the supply of lumber for the British market was a major industry.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The advent of steel and steam brought an end to that industry.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A report of a visit to Black river in 1833 notes that settlers in the area were heavily engaged in agriculture while another report about Bay du Vin in the following year notes their continuing heavy dependence on lumbering.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Farms were small (100 acres including woodland) and farming was mixed; most folk grew their own food.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Barter was the order of the day.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Little cash traded hands.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A half-dozen milk cows and some young cattle, a horse or two, and the horse-drawn implements, 25 hens, maybe a few geese and ducks, some vegetables, and usually a pig or cow for winter meat.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Eggs and butter were traded at the local store, and later in Loggieville or Chatham, for sugar, tea and other staples.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Employment was practically nil; a few people worked at Fowlie's sawmill.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Many went off to work in the woods during the winter; others fished smelts in the winter and drifted for salmon in the summer; some found work in Moncton with the CNR, Eaton's of other local establishments. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Living Costs</b></p>
<p>Some costs in 1930:</p>
<p>·	Long pants at Sadler's in Chatham for $1.00 a pair</p>
<p>·	Fresh country butter at Rubenstein's in Chatham for 22 cents per pound</p>
<p>·	2x4 sold for 25 cents each</p>

<p>·	A subscription to the Chatham Gazette was $2.00 per year delivered to your mailbox</p>
<p>·	Six water glasses sold for 29 cents</p>
<p><br></p>

<p>·	$1.25 for a gallon of motor oil</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Sawmills</b></p>
<p><b>The History of Bay du Vin records a sawmill in Bay du Vin operated by Ortho Robichaud in 1789.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The same history also reports that in 1833, Mr. George Fowlie erected a water-powered gristmill.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The mill, together with wheat, oats and oatmeal was totally destroyed by fire (actual date of fire not known) but believed to be shortly after the mill was constructed; arson was thought to be the cause.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>An undated newspaper clipping quotes Eldon Fowlie as saying the gristmill was very busy during WW! Supplying flour to many communities along the Miramichi.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In 1932, after being idle for many years, the gristmill was remodeled.</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>The mill was the site of a training program just prior to WW2 offering carpentry and perhaps blacksmithing for young unemployed men.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I do not believe the gristmill operated after that.</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Fowlie's also operated a sawmill at the same site but I do not know when it was established, however, the sawmill was operating in 1939 and, I believe, was the largest employer in the community employing about a dozen men.</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>John W. McNaughton operated a diesel-powered sawmill across from his home in Upper Black River during the summer months. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Road system</b></p>
<p>According to the History of Bay du Vin, 25 pounds was appropriated in 1819 to develop a road from Black River to Bay du Vin and, in 1824, John Bailey Williston was given a sum of money to build the road from Bay du Vin to Black River to a width of 20 feet.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>In 1939, the community was a ribbon development along unpaved roads on both sides of the River.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A side road led to the Wells brook settlement and another road looped around Little Branch</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Roadways were often below the level of the surrounding fields.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In addition, the sides of the road were covered with blueberry bushes, shrubs and small trees; this caused the roads to hold snow in winter when times were demanding year-round transportation. Some roads also were bordered with wooden rail fences.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As a result, winter travel was often by ice on the river or temporary roads through farmer's fields or adjoining woods.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Road maintenance was minimal.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A horse drawn grader was available on rotation to scrape ditches and shape roads.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Each landowner was required to provide a certain number of hours of Statute Labour, better known as “stated labour”.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Work done with a team of horses counted for more than the efforts of a man with pick and shovel.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I cannot remember any powered road equipment at that time although I am sure it existed elsewhere</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Traces of the Bark Road may still be seen; the road had been established originally to haul bark from the Black River area to both Chatham and Newcastle during the shipbuilding era.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I believe that the Bark road started near the Mackenzie Settlement, crossed woodland properties in the Branch and Black River, crossed the Black River, travelled along the short cut towards Point Aux Carr then turned west, crossed the Napan road and eventually ended up at Chatham or Newcastle.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Even when I was a youngster, I remember someone pointing out a bark road which by then was only an overgrown road where it crossed our property but could be more clearly seen and perhaps even used where it crossed the McKnight Road.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>While I am not sure of the year when the Richibucto road was paved, I do recall traveling once with Uncle Jim Watling to Chatham by horse and wagon (maybe in 1939) - and we traveled the unpaved Richibucto road (Route 11); it was newly built and covered with fine grey gravel.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>There were not many cars in the community and, during the depression; some people put their cars on block in their barns because they could not afford to run them.</p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Bridges</b></p>
<p>There were three covered bridges in Black River.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The longest, the Victoria Bridge, was located near the mouth of the River and had a pier in the center of the span.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The Cameron Bridge at Middle Black River was the shortest consisting of a single span without any central piers.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The Little Branch Bridge near the mouth of the Little Branch River had one long covered span and a short open one. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The spans met at a common pier which was a wooden crib filled with field stone and clad with plank. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>All three covered bridges were of the same design consisting of large trusses designed to take the weight of the bridge and the wagons crossing them.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Other than nails and spikes, were the huge steel vertical steel rods helping to support the structure.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The bridge had a shingled pitch roof and the sides were boarded vertically. The main floor was planked crosswise with a final flooring of 2-inch plank running lengthwise. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Smaller streams were crossed by open bridges with the bridge resting on a crib filled with stone at each end of the span.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Cribbing was usually made of cedar poles filled with granite and graveled to form part of the roadway.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Most of the open bridges had a railing for safety. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Each residence was reached from a small wooden bridge or culvert spanning the ditch running along the side of the road<b>.</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Education</b></p>
<p>In his book, Black River and its First Settlers, A. W. MacDougall points out that most of the early settlers in Black River spoke Gaelic.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Scots gave high priority to education and it was not surprising that their attention turned to providing instruction first in a barn belonging to Archibald Cameron, Sr. and later teachers provided instruction in their own homes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In 1825, residents petitioned for the erection of a school which was built across the road from the Richard Godfrey residence.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This school, roughly half way between the Little Branch and Cameron Bridges, seems to have served all of Black River and as far east as Bay du Vin.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>About 1845, the district was divided with one school being built at Middle Black River and another at Bayside (now Miramichi).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A few years later a school was erected at Little Branch; the Little Branch School burned shortly after but was soon replaced. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The date of construction of the Victoria school is not known.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Schools were constructed of wood and covered with eastern cedar shingles, which soon turned gray from weathering.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Typically, schools had an entry where one removed one's heavy outer garments.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>On the other end was a woodshed capable of holding 8-10 cords of wood required to keep the school warm in winter.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Some had a pump to provide fresh water; some had a pump that did not work; at still other schools students trudged to a nearby farm house summer and winter carrying water back to the school in an 8-quart pail.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Schools were also served by an outdoor toilet, usually a single building with separate entrances for boys and girls.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Schools in the area offered instruction to the end of grade eight. After that some students stayed with relatives or friends in Loggieville or Chatham while they completed the Grade nine or higher.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Many young people, including my sister Venetia, wrote Normal School entrance Exams after Grade Nine and enrolled directly in the Provincial Normal School in Fredericton.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A year later they were a full-fledged teacher. <span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>About 1937, the Rev. Douglas Smith, Rector at St. John's Anglican Church in Bay du Vin provided tutoring in the Rectory to high school students in the area.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The response was positive and the program expanded.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Soon additional teachers were required and classes were held in the church basement and the local hall. Students from Black River walked, bicycled or traveled by horse to attend school.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In 1939 the Miramichi Rural High School, the first of its kind in New Brunswick, was erected at Bayside (later renamed Miramichi) and classes, totaling 67 students, were moved from the church in January 1940.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The High School district included the three Black River Schools - Little Branch, Victoria and the Cameron School, Bayside, Auburnville, Bay du Vin and Bay du Vin River.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>With the arrival of the Miramichi Rural High School, the first rural high school to be built in New Brunswick, one-room schools provided instruction only to Grade six; grades 7-11 were available at MRHS with bus transportation to the high school being provided by the Godfrey brothers.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Just before WW2, an adult training program was offered for young men of the community at Fowlie's mill; John took an adult education course in Newcastle consisting of drawing, wood, metal work, agriculture, etc.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I think it was only for 5 or six months one winter.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Sewing classes were held in the school for women of the community<b>.</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Churches</b></p>
<p>According to A. W. McDougall, most of the first settlers were Presbyterian and would have been served by an itinerant ministers and missionaries.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The first church, thought to be Presbyterian but used by all Protestants in the area, was built in Bay du Vin in 1812.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In 1818 the people of Bay du Vin, Burnt Church and Tabusintac petitioned for a minister to serve the three charges.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The people of Black River decided to build their own church and, on November 20, 1836, St. Stephens Presbyterian Church was officially opened.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The first building, I believe, was erected closer to the water and would have been near the centre of what is now the cemetery. Between the present church and the cemetery.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The church became dilapidated and, rather than undertake repairs, a new building, the present St. Stephens Church (at that time Presbyterian) was opened on December 30, 1906.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>As a result of the creation of the United Church of Canada in 1925, members who wished to continue in the Presbyterian faith found themselves without a building.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>For a few years they met in member's homes or the school.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In 1930, St. Paul's Presbyterian Church was officially opened and St. Stephens continued to serve the community as St. Stephens United Church. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p><b>Cemetery</b></p>
<p>The Black River Cemetery is situated on a point of land known as Gunn's Point, and later Church Point; it was part of Lot No. 4 originally granted to Enoch Gunn on June 3, 1812.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The property was purchased by Enoch Godfrey in 1820 and the first burial, I believe, was that of Enoch Godfrey's father-in-law, Robert MacBeath in 1823 while still privately owned.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Prior to that, burials were in Bay du Vin.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In 1836, a new church, St. Stephen's Presbyterian, was opened in Black River an area now part of the cemetery. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A more detailed history of the church and the cemetery can be found in an article by Ernie MacLean in the <span><i>Spring 2001 Issue of Generations.</i><span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Following the creation of the United Church of Canada in 1925, St. Stephens United Church confirmed full burial rights to those former members who decided to continue in the Presbyterians tradition.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Today, this sacred plot is considered a community burial ground<b>.</b></p>

<p><span><b>Community Hall</b></span></p>
<p>Like most communities of the day, the church and the local school served as centers for community gatherings.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This changed in 1931 with the opening of the Black River Community Hall on the same site as the current building.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Most of the information that follows was gleaned and interpreted from The Book of Accounts for the Black River Community Hall for the period 1930 to 1973, newspaper references, personal knowledge and discussion with family and friends.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>On October 20, 1930, the first loads of gravel and sand were taken to the site by George Cameron, A. W. MacDougall, Harold Godfrey and Robert Harper.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Wallace MacDonald worked that day but did not haul gravel.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Forms were built on October 21 and 22 and on October 23 and 24 concrete was poured.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A dream began to take shape.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>said that the hall was a two-story building 50 by 34 feet, Three weeks later, on November 13, 1930, the structure was closed in including, I believe, the shingles on the roof – shingles had been purchased from the A&amp;R Loggie Company on October 24, 1930.<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Residents engaged in carpentry included George Godfrey, Alfred MacLean, James Mortimer, Elmer Glendenning, Harold Godfrey, Ian MacNaughton, Ian Mortimer, Bert Gibson and Sinclair Williston. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Not all mentioned above worked every day; others not named also worked but apparently not at carpentry.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Work ceased for the winter.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Financial records show initial donations of $100 from Robertson Orange Lodge, #49 and $300 from the Little Branch Dorcas Club; The Dorcas Club also contributed another a bit over the next few months.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>These funds, together with donated materials and time, enabled the Hall Committee to close-in the building.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>From then on, the Committee was able to pay bills as they were incurred.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>On May 25, 1931 the first dance was held in the new hall; this added $72.50 to the coffers; on June 26 another dance added an additional $40.50.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I cannot tell who played for the first dance but the musicians were paid $9.00.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Mont MacDonald often played, sometimes accompanied by Harry MacDonald or Arthur Taylor.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Most of the building materials came from W &amp; R Walsh, A &amp; R Loggie Company, J W MacNaughton and Herb Fowlie.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>John MacDonald and Duncan MacDonald appear to have been regular paid carpenters</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The next flurry of construction began on October 17, 1931 and concluded on November 11 with the shingling of the sidewalls completed in 1932.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The two-story structure, valued at $1500, was reported to be 50 feet long and 34 feet wide and, I believe, was balloon style framing. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Then, disaster struck.</p>

<p><span><b></b></span><br></p>
<p><span><b></b></span><br></p>
<p><span><b>Homes<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></span></p>
<p>Homes were modest; full two-story homes were rare; many but not all had basements.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Cladding, including roofs, was eastern cedar, usually weather-beaten.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Wood provided energy for both cooking and heating.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Homes with furnaces were fortunate, indeed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Electricity did not arrive for nearly another decade.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Telephone service was available but not in every home.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Horses still were the most common form of transportation both summer and winter.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Late each fall, outside or storm windows were added as a further protection from the cold.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>At the same time, houses were banked.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Banking consisted of building a low wooden wall around the house with the space between the wall and the house being filled with sawdust from the local mill or seaweed from the seashore.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The object was to make the banking high enough to provide extra protection from the ground to a few inches above the lowest shingles.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Telephone service came to the community in 1930.</p>
<p><span><b></b></span><br></p>
<p><b>Recreation</b></p>
<p>Recreation in the early days of the community revolved around the home, the school and the church. People, adults and children alike, visited homes of relatives, neighbours and friends. often staying overnight; Sunday visits were also frequent.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Even the briefest of visits involved lunch and more often a full meal.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was not unusual for kin, including children to visit for a week or so. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Churches were active social centers.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Families went to church for sure on Sunday morning, and often went as well for an evening service.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Mid week services were common as well as special services such as Christmas and Easter.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Churches also organized church suppers as fund raisers either at the church itself, at a local community hall or at a member's home. Summer brought church picnics at the Bayshore</p>
<p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Schools organized both a Christmas and June function, a school closing, sometimes in the afternoon and sometimes at night; students gave recitations or participated in skits and had their school work on display for the visiting parents. Schools were often used for dances both as recreation for young people and to raise money for a worthy cause.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In winter, children and young adults cleared a rink on the river for skating or coasted on a nearby hill. Sometimes after skating or coasting, people would gather at one or more homes for hot chocolate and a mini-party.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Card games were common, especially auction 45, as well as such board games as snakes and ladders, Parcheesi, checkers, Chinese checkers and Parcheesi; pick-up-sticks also became popular later.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I remember Walter going to the Black River Community to play basketball.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Summer was also a time for family picnics, swimming, berry picking or even picnicking with the men during planting or harvesting.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The Black River and its tributaries were known for its trout fishing.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As soon as the ice was out of the river, men and boys dug a few worms, cut a straight alder for a pole, bought a fishing line and a few hooks and headed for the nearest fishing hole.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The Little Branch Bridge was a favourite spot for both locals and visitors alike.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>We sometimes played darts.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Not having a proper cork dartboard, we played against a barn door or wood wall. Neither did we have darts so we made our own.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>To make a dart, one followed these easy steps:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>·	Find a bottle cork - I cannot recall which household items came in bottles with cork but in our house, it was not wine.</p>
<p>·	Sharpen a horseshoe nail.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A horseshoe nail was square, slender and pointed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A bit of filing helped.</p>
<p>·	Push the nail through the cork from the larger diameter to the smaller diameter.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Be careful not to split the cork.</p>
<p>·	Find two matching wing feathers from hens - preferably feathers that the hen had discarded although I know of feathers having been forcibly removed from a reluctant hen.</p>
<p>·	Push the quill, end of a feather, into the large end of the cork on either side of the head of the horseshoe nail.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Again, this step often resulted in splitting the cork.</p>
<p>·	Try the dart turning the feathers as needed to ensure a smooth flight.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>We also played teeter-totter or “buckety wade” in the summer.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It seems that we made ours with a 2x6 plank over a fence or gate, or perhaps a sawhorse. (A 2x4 was not strong enough.)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In order to balance the plank, the lighter person would move a bit closer to the end of the plank. This was a great demonstration of one of the laws of physics</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Home made stilts were common as were home made wagons (ours had wheels made from pieces of birch log cut on the wood cutter).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We would chase an 8–10-inch iron ring for hours steering it with a stick made like a capital tee.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We also could spend hours with an old car tire running around the yard.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And of course, many people, adults as well as children, had bicycles<b>.</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Groceries<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p>At one time, the community had many small stores usually located in part of the home but sometimes, as with the one at John W. MacNaughton, in a separate small building beside the road. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>By 1939, as far as I can determine there were only two grocery stores.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Sandy MacNaughton ran a small store in his home in Upper Black River beside the school.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It appeared to offer minimum groceries, candy and pop; Mrs. MacNaughton was also the local telephone operator.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The other one, operated by George Adams, was at the North end of the Little Branch Bridge.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>While part of an extended house, it had a separate entrance and shelves loaded with groceries in the manner of a real store.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Adams also sold gasoline for automobiles and oil for lamps and lanterns.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Gas was pumped by hand into a glass chamber at the top of the pump.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Gas was sold by the gallon and measurement was by the eye.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>From the top of the gas pump, gasoline flowed by gravity to the gas tank in the car, located in early models in front of the windshield.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>By 1939, however, automobiles were using fuel pumps. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Electric Power</b></p>
<p>Electric power came to Black River, as I recall, in the fall of 1948.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The hydro poles had been put in and wires strung a year or two before.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Mum had the house wired, I think, by Harry Simmonds perhaps even a year before power was turned on.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I was teaching at the Miramichi at the time and remember coming home from school, probably in September or October and looking up the hill to see the house lighted for the first time.</p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Health</b></p>
<p>At one time, Black River had a resident dentist in the person of Doug Dower.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>His office was set up David Murdoch's house on the north side of the river just below Uncle Jack Godfrey's.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I cannot recall whether this was a full-time or part time office.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I do remember, though, that Cameron Russell, my brother-in-law, went to him one Sunday afternoon to have a tooth extracted - extracted, as I recall, without the aid of laughing gas or freezing; Norman remembers going to Doug Dower also on Sunday.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I think that Dower soon closed his office and moved to Chatham.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Years later, he had a fishing/ hunting camp on the river just above the Horton's Creek Bridge.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Dr. J. B. MacKenzie was our family doctor and seemed to be the family doctor of all our neighbours.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>At one time, he lived in Loggieville but later moved to Newcastle, presumably to be closer to the hospital.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I guess people made office visits but I only seem to remember his visits to the country.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Once, I recall, his snowmobile broke down at our lane.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>People often came to our house to phone the doctor in time of need so we seemed to know when people were sick.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If people knew that the doctor was in the community, they would hand a lantern on their gatepost so the doctor would know to stop on his way back to town<b>.</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Blacksmith shops</b></p>
<p>Sinclair Williston lived near the Hexham corner and operated a blacksmith shop.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>His home was in a long lane and one came to the blacksmith shop on the left side of the lane before reaching the house.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was a relatively small shop with a brick forge, bellows, anvil, hammers and tongs, etc.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And of course, like all blacksmith shops, had a very definite smell of coal smoke.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Sinclair did all kinds of blacksmith work, made and sharpened horseshoes, made or tightened wagon rims, made fittings and shoes for sleds, and of course, shod d horses.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It seems to me that horses were shod outside in nice weather but could step inside when the weather was cold or it was storming.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Furthermore, Sinclair had a special contraption to hold horses that were hard to shoe.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The other blacksmith shop was operated by Johnny Dick in Upper Black River.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The smithy was very close to the road.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Although I cannot ever remember visiting the shop, I am sure that he did all the usual blacksmithing.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>While farm horses used shoes both summer and winter, winter shoes were much sharper and had to be sharpened more often. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><span><b>Agricultural Society</b><b></b></span></p>
<p>With the recent passing of Harry Watling, I was reminded of the Agricultural Society #103.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I do not know the history of agricultural societies generally or of the one in Black River but hopefully someday a full history will be written. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My father was Secretary Treasurer and ran the "store' for 18 or more years and my brother filled the same role for another 16 years.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Local farmers were members of Agriculture Societies; records show membership in the 1930's to be one dollar. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Farmers placed orders for lime and fertilizer, which the Secretary Treasurer ordered and would be delivered to Loggieville by rail car.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>when the lime and fertilizer was on the siding in Loggieville, farmers would travel to the site with horses and wagons, pick up their supply and take it home.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Depending on how much was ordered, several wagon trips were sometimes required the early days, lime and fertilizer arrived loose and had to be shoveled by hand onto the wagons.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>usually, the Secretary Treasurer hired men to load the farmer's wagons.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In later years, lime and fertilizer arrived by rail in aper bags.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>In addition, the Secretary Treasurer estimated the requirement for seed, ordered a supply and sold them in small quantities as required.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Seeds included timothy, red and alsike clover, alfalfa, turnips, mangles, sugar beets.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Pesticides and herbicides were also sold from the store.</p>
