<p>My notes</p>
<p><b>Educational Advisor</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>There is a major gap in our educational system, a gap that results, I believe, from the fact that we fail to differentiate between education and schooling.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Just think of the question “Where did you get your education?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>What the person wants to know is where did you go to school or what university did you go to.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As a result, we fail to provide independent advice to learners of all ages as to their educational concerns.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The system expects you to go to an institution for advice about education; what you get is advice about their product.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It’s a bit like going to the Ford dealer to ask about a transportation problem.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Learning benefits from a variety of support such as personal well-being, counselling, feedback, information, opportunity, encouragement, instruction and guided practice; homes and communities are major suppliers of educational support.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Schools are also important but they have a limited focus, that of providing instruction in a range of academic studies.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Decisions about education are often complex, are a major determinant of the kind of future we will have, confront us with many options each with its own set of consequences; and are becoming moreso.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A case in point is the many young people with shiny diplomas and degrees still lacking the basic<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>skills to function in a modern economy.</p>
<p><br></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li6">Assistance/advice readily available to students</li>
  <li class="li6">Educational advice to people not in school is limited and mostly focused on employability</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li6">Proposal:</li>
</ul>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li6">To establish an education advisory service for people are not in the school system. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li6">The service to be individualized, personalized, separate from the school system.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li6">Services to include information, counselling, advice, assessment and referral depending on individual needs and objectives.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
</ul>
<p>The office would serve a community not a school district and operate out of local</p>
<p><b>A family adviser on education</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>The process of getting an education is a complex one; it involves developing the knowledge, skills and attitudes that enable us to live a full and productive life; choices abound and each choice has its own consequences.<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Families have a family doctor, perhaps a financial advisor, often an accountant, sometimes a lawyer and perhaps other advisers, but when it comes to education, a much more complex field, learners and families are left on their own. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Jan Hodges (“Careers education needs to be an ongoing dialogue, in which information is discussed at every stage”, Manchester Guardian, Wednesday, May 29) identified the need to expand existing school-based counselling with “independent advice and guidance” about career education for 16-18 year-old youth; information would be directed not only to young people but also to their parents and teachers.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The need for advice on educational matters, however, exists well beyond careers and school walls; people of all ages could benefit from information, counseling, direction, advice and sometimes just an attentive ear.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Guidance counselors work with students in school; educational advisors would be available to anyone but would mostly serve people not in school. <span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></p>

<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>A number of people commented on my most recent letter and wondered where the change process should begin.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The short answer is that changes can be implemented in a number of places and by a number of people.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Two bits of advice that I was given years ago have stood me in good stead; when a long term plan is not clear, ‘do the next right thing’ and do it now.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Below is a short list of actions for your consideration.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They are steps in the right direction, can be instituted immediately at little or no incremental cost and with a minimum disruption to teaching-learning process:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li6"><b>Students and Parents –<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span></b>as consumers of school services<b>, </b>I would like to say “shop around”, however, given that schooling is a monopoly offered almost wholly by the government, that is not possible.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You should, however, not hesitate to talk frequently and in depth with your teacher(s).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And be specific about vocabulary, comprehension, attendance, likelihood of graduating, etc.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Have the same kind of conversation with your teacher that you would have with your doctor.</li>
  <li class="li6"><b>Teachers </b>– review educational outcomes for your subjects’ to ensure that they are clear, unambiguous and measurable.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Most outcomes I encounter in the educational literature have strayed far from the path.</li>
  <li class="li6"><b>Department </b>– identify reading as a separate subject and include it on school report cards.</li>
  <li class="li6"><b>Trustees</b> – conduct exit interviews with every student who leaves school without graduating to pinpoint the causes and to ensure that you are prviding the best schooling you can...</li>
  <li class="li6"><b>Employers</b> – base hiring decisions on skills required rather than subjects studied.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Schools prepare students to enter the next level of education or to go to work.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Requirements to enter college or university are quite clear; skills desired for the workplace are still a work in progress.</li>
  <li class="li6"><b>Me </b>– I’ll continue to write letters to the editor.</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p>Although a short list, I believe that implementation of these baby steps would have a significant positive impact on what happens in school. .<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p><b>When a school can’t help</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>Recently I had a conversation with a parent whose child is not reading “at grade level”; I’ve often had the same conversation, especially with grandparents.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It seems that the student in question encountered difficulty with reading.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Or it could be a case of a teacher having difficulty with the teaching of reading.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In each case the student enrolled in a private school with parents or grandparents paying the tuition.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In all the cases brought to my attention, private instruction worked and reading skills improved, dramatically.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Schools cannot be expected to have all the expertise and resources needed to teach everything to everyone.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But reading is a “must know” skill and should, therefore, have priority over all other subjects. Without a reasonable level of reading, lifelong learning is lost.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Furthermore, when a school cannot help a student reach a reasonable level of reading, I believe that it is the school’s responsibility to find a solution and to pay the cost.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There’s no reason why a parent should have to pay the extra tuition while also paying taxes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Such an expense should be an item in each school budget.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Perhaps it’s time to allow, even encourage, reading clinics outside school system in the same way that we allow health services outside the hospital, paid for of course, out of<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>the education budget on a fee for service basis.</p>
<p><br></p>

<p><b>Advisor, Advocate, or Ombudsman?</b></p>
<p>Friends may recall me saying on occasion that education could benefit from having the advice of a “family education advisor”, someone who would serve a role in education similar to that of a family doctor for our health needs.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Operating outside the school system, an advisor would be available to any Islander who needs assistance in making decisions about their education.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Like a family doctor, th educational advisor would<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Recent conversations, however, suggest that every student needs an advocate, someone who has a vested interest in helping student</p>
<p>Then a few days ago, there was an item in, I believe, the Washington Post, to the effect<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>that the matter of a student ombudsman was under active consideration.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>An ombudsman fills a different role and may be necessary because<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>education is, in effect, a requirement, that choice is minimum and there is really only one provider.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Your views on the tyranny of time are welcome at standards2020@gmail.com<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
