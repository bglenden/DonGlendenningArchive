  McKenzie Settlement
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Brief genealogical note on the naming and land settlement of McKenzie Settlement. Don speculates that the settlement was named after John and Roderick MacKenzie, who received land grants in 1871 and 1873 respectively. Questions whether Roderick was the Roderick MacKenzie who married his great-grandfather&#x27;s sister Annabelle MacDonald. Notes John K. MacKenzie received lot #163 (100 acres) in 1907, possibly the &quot;Aunt Tine&#x27;s second husband&quot; mentioned elsewhere. Records that Mary Anderson received 300 acres at the Little Branch end of the McKenzie Road in 1909.</div>
