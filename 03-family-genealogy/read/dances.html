  Dances
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Don&#x27;s first dance in June 1946 at age 16—a &quot;Lancer&quot; with Norma Williston (classmate from Branch School and Miramichi Rural High School). That summer he attended dances two to three times weekly at various halls (Black River Hall, Mel Adams&#x27; hall, Napan School, Sunny Corner) with friends including Francis MacNaughton. Describes a brawl that emptied the Black River Hall. Includes story of Jim Finno, a blind neighbor with an apple orchard, and the incident where Don&#x27;s group attempted to steal &quot;transparent&quot; apples but fled when Finno appeared, resulting in Don&#x27;s sprained ankle.</div>

<p><b>My first Dance</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>One late afternoon about the second week of June 1946, Elinor and I were in the front yard, perhaps even raking the yard, when Harry MacLean walked by on the way home (from work?).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We spoke as he walked by and he asked me if I was going to the dance in the Black River Hall that night.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I went for the first time and had my first dance, a “Lancer”, with Norma Williston.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Norma and I were in the same Grade at the Branch School and later at the Miramichi Rural High School.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>That summer we often went to dances two or three times a week at the Black River Hall, at Mel Adams’ hall, Napan School and probably elsewhere.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>One night a fight erupted at the Black River Hall and spilled out into the yard emptying the hall.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Francis MacNaughton and I even went to dances in Sunny Corner.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Jim Finno</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Earlier I mentioned the Finno home by the river.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Jim Finno was blind.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I believe that he had a dog and stories were told about him having a shotgun.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He had a small apple orchard, which included a “transparent” apple tree.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Transparent were an early apple, a brilliant yellow (but not to be confused with the “Dutch Apples”) and sweet to the taste.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The Finno apples were reputed to be the best.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>One evening about dusk, a number of us decided to try some of his transparent apples.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We went to the wharf and then started up the hill towards the house walking near the riverbank.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When we were still about 150 feet from the house, Mr. Finno came out on the porch.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We did not wait but scrambled over the steep bank.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I forget about the others but recall that I ended up with a sprained ankle.</p>
