  2014 Notes to Committee 2014
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Dated December 3, 2014, from Don to Amanda, Donna, and LoisAnne. Fund market value reached $20,200 (original contributions $14,000+; remainder from investment returns). Provides copies of original agreement and amendment. Explains committee&#x27;s role and Community Foundation&#x27;s investment track record. Notes annual payout is typically 4% ($800 in 2014), but practice has been to spend less to promote growth (now committee&#x27;s decision). Requests signed amendment returns to Foundation. Demonstrates Don&#x27;s personal mentorship of committee members and his satisfaction with results.</div>

<p>December 3, 2014</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>To:	Amanda</p>
<p>	Donna</p>
<p>	LoisAnne</p>
<p><b>Glendenning Fund</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>Trust all is well and that the recent storm was not too unkind.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>We spoke some time ago about the Glendenning Fund; it was established shortly after our 2000 Family reunion; our original target was $5,000 and, if we were lucky, perhaps $10,000.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I phoned a few minutes ago and was told that the market value of the fund today is $20.200; the actual contributions were a bit over 14,000 – the remainder resulted from returns on investment.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>On top of that, we made some grants.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Enclosed is:</p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li1">A copy of the original agreement</li>
  <li class="li1">A copy of the amendment</li>
  <li class="li1">Some notes on<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>the role of the Committee</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p>We chose the Community Foundation to host our fund because that is what community foundations do, and because they have an excellent investment record.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I always thought that one day, there would be a community foundation in the Miramichi and the fund would be transferred to them.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Given PEI’s investment record, one shouldn’t be hasty in making a transfer.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Each year, you will be advised as to how much is available for granting purposes – usually 4% which this year would mean $800; our practice, as Lois Anne knows, has been to use less<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>than what is available in order to grow the Fund – but that decision is now up to you.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Please sign one copy of the amendment, (as donors) and return it to the Foundation; I’d just sign it separately rather than trying to get all three signatures on the same copy</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>You should deal directly with the Foundation from now on but let me know if I can help in any way</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Thanks for agreeing to act and enjoy being a philanthropist</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Don</p>
