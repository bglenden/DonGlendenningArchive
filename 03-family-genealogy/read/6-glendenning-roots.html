</p>
<p>The Canadian roots of my paternal ancestors are in
an area north east of Bathurst, more precisely, the inland community
of Canobie.  Travelling east from Bathurst along the coast towards
Caraquet, one finds a number of communities familiar to the
Glendenning family.  Most relevant are the following as described in
the Geographical Names of New Brunswick, 1875:</p>
<p><br />

</p>
<ul>
	<li><p><b>Bathurst</b>,
	originally named St. Peters in 1671, was named for the Third Earl of
	Bathurst in 1826. 
	</p></li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 0.44in; text-indent: -0.5in">
<b>	</b></p>
<ul>
	<li><p><b>Salmon
	Beach</b>
	was settled around 1820 by immigrants from Ireland and included the
	districts of Prospect Hill, Strawberry Plain and Mount Pleasant.  
	</p></li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 0.94in; text-indent: -0.5in"><br />

</p>
<ul>
	<li><p><b>Janeville</b>
	was named for Jane Dawson, wife of Benjamin Dawson who settled there
	about 1835.  
	</p></li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 0.75in"><br />

</p>
<ul>
	<li><p><b>Stonehaven</b>
	was probably named for Stonehaven, Scotland. <b>
	</b>
	</p></li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: -0.06in; text-indent: 0.5in"><br />

</p>
<ul>
	<li><p><b>New
	Bandon</b>
	was settled in 1819 by several families from Bandon, Ireland.</p></li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: -0.06in"><br />

</p>
<ul>
	<li><p><b>Canobie</b>
	named  after Canonbie, Dumfriesshire, Scotland.  <b>	</b></p></li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: -0.06in"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-left: -0.06in"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-left: -0.06in">According
to  Pioneer Settlers of the Bay Chaleur, settlement on the coast east
of Bathurst took place by the Acadians in the latter half of the
1700s and, although living on the land, they grants were not given
their grants until 1812.  Apparently, an organized system of granting
of land did not evolve until the 1800s and even then there could be
delays of a decade or more between petitioning land and receiving
land.  Even then, a grant was not final until at least five acres had
been cleared.  The first registered land grants in the area were made
to James Sutherland and his brother Hugh, and to Richard Nevison in
1789.</p>
<p style="margin-left: -0.06in"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-left: -0.06in">Once
settled, men began the task of clearing land and erecting a house and
barn.  Trees not needed were stacked, dried and burned.  Few oxen or
horses were available so the land was broken and cultivated with the
aid of a hoe.  The initial crops were planted between the stumps,
which, over time, rotted and were removed.  In many cases, the
initial seeds were often carried by settlers from the old country.</p>
<p style="margin-left: -0.06in"><br />

</p>
<p>While
I do not know the precise point where my ancestors set foot in the
new world, we do know that many immigrants first set foot in Canadfa
in such ports as Saint John and Halifax; some likely trans-shipped to
smaller ports.  On the other hand, some came directly to the
Miramichi, Bathurst, Pokeshaw, Bass River and Caraquet.  The Bay
Chaleur history records that Pokeshaw had a secure harbour and was an
active fishing centre.  As early as 1812, 30 acres of land had been
cleared and had a number of houses constructed.  Sailing vessels
stopped there for water and supplies including fresh meat.  
</p>
<p><br />

</p>
<p>The
exception to our not knowing is the account given by my Great
Grandmother’s sister, Mary Ann Harley, who first set foot in Canada
at Pokemouche on the Baie de Chaleur near Bathurst, New Brunswick. 
Mary Ann was born in Courtmacsherry, Ireland on 6 February, 1799.  On
her 99<sup>th</sup>
birthday, she was interviewed by a newspaper in Portland, Maine where
she was living. I am grateful to Willis Hamilton for a copy of an
article appearing in a Portland paper at that time.</p>
<p><br />

</p>
<div id="Section1" dir="ltr"><p style="margin-left: 0.5in">
	<i>I
	was born in Courtmasherry, Ireland, February 6, 1799.  This is a
	small town only a little distance from the city of Cork, near the
	Bay of Cork.  My maiden name was Mary Ann Harley, and my father was
	a schoolteacher in the town.  I had two brothers and three sisters. 
	All dead now.  One of my sisters lived to be 94, died on her
	birthday.  I can remember the town where we lived very well, and the
	names of friends and schoolmates.  I left Ireland in 1822.  I can
	remember about my father and mother talking about the rising of ‘98;
	people never seemed to get tired of taking about that event.  My
	father was of English descent, a Presbyterian and I was raised in
	the church.</i></p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><i>Very
	well can I remember the day on which two big ships of war sailed
	into Cork harbor, their decks crowded with men and their masts with
	gay flags.  These ships were bringing us the first news of the
	battle of Waterloo in which that terror of the world and ogre of
	history, Napoleon Bonaparte was defeated by our own Duke of
	Wellington.  People went crazy with joy; the bells of the city of
	Cork were rung, and great bonfires were lit in celebration of the
	great event.  Three of the officers of an Irish regiment were
	quartered at my father’s house for many days, and I remember some
	of the stories they had to tell of that terrible fight.  Their
	bright uniforms and handsome faces made a great impression on me.</i></p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><i>In
	1822 I went to visit a lady friend in Queenstown, and while I was
	there the first steamboat ever to come into Irish waters came into
	the harbor.  Everyone turned out and lined the docks to the strange
	craft which moved so swiftly through the waters without sail or
	oars.  It was a wonderful thing then, but I suppose the people of
	Queenstown see enough such craft now.  While I was in Queenstown I
	got a letter from my brother William in America.  He was a
	government surveyor, and he wanted me to come over as soon as
	possible as he said he had a young, handsome and wealthy husband
	waiting for me.  I went home to my parents and it was decided that I
	would sail for America.</i></p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><i>I
	was one of 150 passengers on a sailing ship which left Cork on May
	7, 1822.  It was a terrible voyage.  I was sick almost all the way,
	and glad to see land after seven weeks and three days aboard that
	ship.  I landed at a place called Pockshaw on the Bay of Chaleur. 
	It was a very small settlement then, only a few small houses made of
	logs.  My brother was there waiting for me.  We had to walk 75 miles
	through the woods to get to his home.  No roads, no conveyances of
	any kind, not even a path.  It was a trackless forest in which not
	one tree had been cut.  We made our way by means of compass over
	windfalls and across brooks to Newcastle.  We were three nights on
	the road and we had to sleep in the woods without any shelter.  On
	the fourth night we got to Newcastle, a very small settlement. 
	Eight months after my arrival at this place I married John Henry; he
	was a man of business and agent for a large mercantile firm.  I had
	nine children and seven grew up and married.  I don’t know how
	many descendents I have, but they must number in the hundreds.  My
	husband died 28 years ago (1870) I lived on the Miramichi until
	after my husband's death, then I came to the States where some of my
	children lived.  I had a brother named John Harley who built ships
	on Bolters Island near Newcastle.</i></p>

first, church services were held in the local school but in 1899 this
church was built and used by Presbyterians, Methodists and Anglicans.
 (It is now an Anglican Church).  
</p>
<p align="justify"><br />

</p>
<p align="justify">Our
Grandfather, Walter, was active in the church including being a
Sunday school teacher.  He is also reported to have been one of the
first trustees and, according to the Chaleur history, cut the first
lumber to start the building.  The 1891 census shows Walter as
Presbyterian.</p>

</p>
<p align="justify">I do not know where my Great Grandparents, John
and Margaret Glendinning are buried but believe them to be buried in
the New Bandon Cemetery where a number of their descendants are
buried.  George Glendenning told me that on a number of occasions
bones were encountered when digging new graves in that cemetery. 
George also thinks that John Glendinning may have attended/been a
member of the Methodist Church.</p>

<p>But the essence of a community is its people.  The
remaining paragraphs, therefore, provide such information as I have
gathered on each of the following families known to be a direct
ancestor:</p>
<p><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in">A	BEATTIE</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in">B	RAE</p>

<p><br />

</p>
<p><br />

</p>
<p><b>A	BEATTIE</b></p>
<p align="justify">My
Great-Great-Great grandmother is believed to have been Elizabeth
Beattie who married James Glendinning.   Beattie, also spelled Beatty
and Beaty, is also a Scottish and a well known Border surname.  Other
old forms of the name include Baetie, Baitie, Baittie, Baitty, Batye,
Baytie, Beatie, Betay, Betie, Bette and Bettie.    It=s exact origin
is not known, however it is thought to have come from the name
Beatrice or Bartholomew. According to Black=s Surnames of Scotland,
there was a Gilbert fitz Beatrice in Roxburge County in 1296. In 1569
mention is made of a Hew Batie and Johnne Batie. The name also
appeared in the north of Scotland where John Betty was burgess of
Aberdeen in 1473.  Battles and Beatsons were common in Upper Eskdale,
Andrew Batie was burgess of Dumfries in 1567, and there are many
other references in Black’s Surnames of Scotland. Beattie is a Sept
of the MacBeath clan.   
</p>
<p align="justify"><br />

</p>
<p align="justify"><br />

</p>
<p><b>B	RAE</b></p>
<p align="center"><br />

</p>
<p align="justify">My Great-great-grandmother, Mary Rae, married John
Glendinning in Scotland.  Rae, Rea and Ree are old surnames in
Dumfriesshire and are probably of local origin.  They appear to have
been a troublesome lot and were frequently in court.  According to
Black’s Surnames of Scotland, the earliest mention of the name is
around 1231 when Robert Raa a mason, witnessed a charter to the Abbey
of Culross. Thomas Ra was a witness about 1290, Robert Ra was burgess
of Stirling in 1296-1300, William Raa had a pension in 1329, Robert
Raa was a juror at an inquest in Roxburgh in 1380, William Raa was
Bishop of Glasgow and there are other instances of the name Raa.  The
name also appeared in Perth in 1546.  Rae is a Sept of the MacRae
clan.  MacRae means son of Rae.</p>

<p align="justify">My
Great Grandmother, Margaret (Harley) Glendinning was the daughter of
William Harley and Anne Biddrrs.  I know not their origin but lt was
likely in England and they mmigrated later to Ireland.</p>
<p align="justify"><br />

</p>
<p align="justify"><b>D	HARLEY</b></p>
<p align="justify"><br />

</p>
<p align="justify">My
great- grandmother was Margaret Harley. Most of the information comes
from secondary sources - family lore and Pioneer Settlers of the Bay
Chaleur which was published in 1978. It is also based on entries in
the old family Bible, inscriptions on headstones and information
provided by Willis Hamilton. 
</p>
<p align="justify"><br />

</p>
<p align="justify">Harley
is a well-known English name in Ireland.  According to my sources,
the name is also found in Scotland but is considered in Scotland as a
late-comer from England.  The name is recorded as early as 1228. 
Harle, Harles, Harrily and Hurley, the latter in Cork County,
Ireland.<b>
</b>One
source suggests that Harley is derived from Hareswood - the name of
places in both Shropshire and Yorkshire, England.  According to
Black’s Surnames of Scotland, Johannes de Herl witnessed a charter
in the Abbey of Kelso around 1228. De Herl is thought to have come
from Kirkharle in Northumberland which is the name of a property in
Northumberland County.<b>
 </b>An
earlier version, Harrily, appears to have disappeared.</p>

Courtmacsherry, a small town near Cork, County Cork,  Ireland.  Her
father, William, was of English descent and was a school teacher in
Courtmacsherry.  He was Presbyterian and, apparently, quite active in
the church. At least one of the children, Mary Ann, was born in
Courtmacsherry and refers to herself as having been raised in the
church.  The chances are that the other four children were born and
lived in Courtmacshery as well.  Five Harley siblings came to New

of the Bay of Chaleur says that the Peters came from Irleand,
however, my search shows Peters, meaning “Peter, a rock”, and is
not uncommon in the  Angus, Kincardine and Aberdeen areas of
Scotland.   The name John Peter is found in 1636, Andro Peter in
Kirkcaldie in 1840, David Peter in Peebles, southern Scotland, in
1645 and Alexander Peter in Melrose in 1648.  The name is also found
in southern Scotland which is closer to Dumfrieshsire.  Peters,
Pieter, Peterson and probably Petrie  have the same roots.  My

<p><b>2	Dumfriesshire</b></p>
<p><br />

</p>
<p>Dumfriesshire,
in southern Scotland, is considered the home of the Glendennings with
the first record of the family being a deed granting territories of
all the baronies of Clifton and Merbotel in Roxburghshire to Adam de
Glendonwyn in 1286.</p>
<p><br />

</p>
<p>Dumfriesshire
and Roxburghshire are actually adjacent to each other in southern
Scotland near the border with England. The area was subject to many
changes as a result of invasions by Celts, Irish Gaels, Angles, Picts
, and Vikings. By the year 1000, discernable clans and families began
to emerge. This area figured prominently in the many border disputes
between England and Scotland.</p>
<p><br />

</p>
<p>My great Grandfather, John Glendinning, was born
in Callister Hall in Dumfriesshire, Scotland in 1807.  He came to New
Brunswick in 1830.  <u>Bartholemew’s Gazetteer of the British
Isles, 1887</u>, described Dumfriesshire as follows:</p>

<p><b>3	Annan</b></p>
<p><br />

</p>
<p>Because
John Glendinning sailed from Annan, my early view was that Annan was
significant component in my search.  I now realize, however, it was
simply the seaport from which John Glendinning sailed.  Nevertheless,
having gathered the information, I include it here for the reader’s
information.  
</p>
<p><br />

</p>
<p>Annan
was founded by Robert the Bruce and developed at a major crossing of
the Annan River.  Annan was often fought over during the times of
Anglo-Scottish conflict.  Between 1298, when it was first destroyed
until after 1660, it was a frequent site of battles.  Erosion took
away part of the early castle and silting later left the town too far
inland for navigation.  Annan, it seems, became a major embarkation
point for Scottish settlers.  People gave their departure point as
Annan even though their homes may have bee far from there.</p>
<p><br />

</p>
<p>The
reference to Robert the Bruce is interesting also because, in the
late 1940’s, a member of the Mormon  Church visited Black river
and, among other things, said that the Gendennings were related to
Robert the Bruce.</p>
<p><br />

</p>
<p>In
1956 I contacted City Hall in Annan and told of my family connection.
 My letter was passed to James Glendinning who owned and operated a
men’s clothing store.  Later I visited Annan and stayed, as I
recall, two nights with James maiden aunts.  Next day, James took me
on a tour of the countryside but I do not remember visiting Callister
Hall where my Great Grandfather, John, was born.  James has since
died and the store is operated by his son, Walter, who I met on a
return visit to Annan.  .  (www.glen hire.demon.co.uk)

<p><b>4	Glendinning
Hamlet</b></p>
<p><br />

</p>
<p><br />

</p>
<p>In
the mid to late 1800s (and likely much earlier) the name Glendinning
Hamlet was included in maps of Scotland.  It  was a small hamlet
located some 25 to 30 miles north of Annan. It was known in the late
1700s for its antimony mining. In the mid 1800s the ruins of a castle
could still be seen there.  My search so far has not turned up any
direct connection between my ancestors and Glendinning Hamlet
although it is likely that such a connection exists.</p>

</p>
<p style="margin-left: -0.06in">It is customary in Scotland to name
each property. Callister Hall is the name of the property where John
Glendinning was born in 1807. It still stands today and is shown on
some Scottish maps although seems to have disappeared from the more
recent ones.  Callister Hall is located some 15 miles northeast of
Annan; Callister Hall is a whitewashed stone sheep farmer's home and
is located along a country road some five miles west of Langholm. 
</p>
<p style="margin-left: -0.06in"><br />

</p>
<h3>In September, 1989, I visited Callister Hall. It
is a single story stone, whitewashed sheep farmers cottage located
some 25 miles northeast of Annan and some five miles west of
Langholm, on a country road in rolling, somewhat stony, country. At
the time of my visit, Callister Hall was occupied by a family named
McKennel (McCannel?). Callister Hall is thought to have been a
halfway house (country inn) and to have suffered a major fire but was
rebuilt.  Since then, Joy Ayer, a GGGranddaughter of John
Glendinning, visited Callister Hall on a day that new owners, by the
name of Domoney, were moving in.  Joy has kept in touch with the new
residents.</h3>

<h1>Don and
Janet Glendenning on Main Street, Annan, Scotland</h1>
<p align="center"><br />

</p>
<p><b>6	Origin
of Name Glendenning</b></p>
<p><br />

</p>
<p>The
name Glendinning is believed to be locational in nature and probably
means &quot;one who came from the hidden dale&quot;. Glen is a common
prefix and signifies a narrow valley bounding a river or stream. The
name has been, and still is, spelled in a variety of ways but can be
linked to Glendinning, Glendining, Glendennings, Glendowyne,
Glenndinnin, Glendynwynnng, Glendinnin, Glendouwyne, Glendounn, and
Glendoning. The two most frequent spellings are Glendinning and
Glendenning.  The name Glendwnwyne firs appears in 1384 in the Parish
of Westerkirk, Dumfries.</p>
<p><br />

</p>
<p>Another
source suggests that the name originated in Wales and belonged to the
Glendowers which was the Royal Family of Wales.  Many Welsh moved to
the Border area of Scotland which is where the Glendinnings are
found.  In 1263 at the Battle of Largs, Robert de Glendonwyn
distinguished himself and was rewarded by the Scotch king with a
grant of large estates in Ayr.   The name Glendenning  was known in
Scotland before this as the name of a large tract of land owned by
the Douglas family.</p>
<p><br />

</p>
<p>While
browsing the internet (2002/03/28) I found a reference to Glendonwyne
originating from <i>“Glyn”
</i>meaning
valley<i>,
“</i>din”
being a fort and <i>“gwyn”
</i>meaning
fair or white.  This could be interpreted as fair skinned people from
the fort in the valley.</p>
<p><br />

</p>
<p><b>7	Glendinning
or Glendenning</b></p>
<p><br />

</p>
<p>It
is not clear when or why the name Glendinning changed to Glendenning.
The original entries in the family Bible, as noted earlier, are
Glendinning. The name appearing on the gravestones for Walter and
John, the next generation, is Glendenning.  The early land petitions
were Glendinning while the later ones were Glendenning.  The change
is most likely due simply to poor handwriting.

<p><b>9	Glendenning
Coat of Arms</b></p>
<p><br />

</p>
<p>The
drawing of the coat of arms included in this text was obtained from a
coat of arms given to me as a Christmas gift. It has not been
verified by the Court of the Lord Lyon of Scotland. One variation of
the Coat of Arms shows a pair of hand holding a cross and the motto &quot;
Have Faith in the Cross&quot; Which version is the original and which
a modification, I do not know.  I have found a number of coats of
arms for Glendenning which are very similar to the one included in
this text.</p>

<p><b>10	Clan
Connection</b></p>
<p><br />

</p>
<p>The
Glendennings became closely associated with the Douglas clan and
rented land in 1408 from Archibald, Lord of Galloway who was a
Douglas. In fact the Glendennings are usually referred to as a &quot;sept&quot;
of the Douglas clan rather than being a clan in their own right.
Matthew of Glendonwyn became Bishop of Glasgow in 1408. William
Glendonwyn was Rector at Crawfordian. Simon, chief of the Clan, acted
as a go-between in arranging a truce between England and Scotland in
1451. In 1548 the Glendennings were condemned by the Scottish
Parliament as one of the &quot;unruly clans&quot;. John Glendinning
was outlawed in 1667 and his lands and titles were forfeited.</p>
<p><br />

</p>
<p>But
there also appears to be a connection to the Elliot/Eliot Clan. 
Certainly they are from the same geographic area but the kinship
awaits further exploration.</p>
<p><br />

</p>
<p><br />

</p>
<p><b>11	Other
Glendennings</b></p>
<p><br />

</p>
<p>New
Brunswick and Nova Scotia have a number of Glendennings and
Clendennings who come from Dumfriesshire but a connection has not yet
been found, at least by me.</p>
<p><br />

</p>
<p>There
are Glendennings in Ontario, some of whom came into Canada as United
Empire Loyalist.  
</p>
<p><br />

</p>
<p>Many
Glendenninngs and Clendennings settled in the Eastern half of the
United States. In fact, Charleston West Virginia was named for
Charles Clendenning.  Again, I have found no connection to our
family.  The <u>Synoptical
Family History Giving Sketches of the Glendonyn- Glendening-
Clendening- Etc. Family.</u>
See Appendix , provides extensive documentation about the
Glendennings in the USA.  The information in it confirms what I have
found and adds some detail.  In my review, other than general
information about our roots in the Border country, no precise matches
were found.  The reader may find the following, taken from this
record, to be interesting:</p>

<p align="left"><b>12	John and Margaret (Harley) Glendinning</b></p>
<p align="center"><br />

</p>
<p>John
Glendinning, my Great-Grandfather, was born on April 2, 1807, at
Callister Hall, Parish of Middlebie, Dumfriesshire, Scotland. He was
baptized on July 10, 1808</p>
<p><br />

</p>
<p>In
1830, he sailed from Annan, a seaport on Dumfriesshire on the south
coast of Scotland.  This would be the nearest port to where he was
born. It is likely, although we have no record, that he landed at
Pokeshaw on the Bay Chaleur near Bathurst, New Brunswick, as Pokeshaw
was a busy seaport and sailing ships seemed to be a regular stop from
overseas.  According to Pioneer Settlers of the Bay Chaleur, John
purchased part of Lot 7 at Salmon Beach, between Pokeshaw and
Bathurst,  from
Fidele and Joseph Arceneau</p>
<p><br />

</p>
<p>On
August 23, 1833, John Glendinning married Margaret Harley who had
come from Ireland to New Brunswick to join other family members.  
</p>
<p align="justify"><br />

</p>
<p align="justify">Margaret
Harley’s father, William, was of English descent but had moved to
Courtmasherry, a small town near Cork, Ireland to teach school.  He
was Presbyterian and, apparently, quite active in the church.  At
least one of the children, Mary Ann, was born in Courtmasherry and
refers to herself as having been raised in the church.  Since
Margaret was the youngest of the family, it is likely that she was
born in Courtmashery as well.</p>
<p align="justify"><br />

</p>
<p align="justify">.
Children of John and Margaret (Harley) Glendenning include:</p>

</p>
<p align="justify">Margaret Glendinning was a schoolteacher and the
first school in Salmon Beach was opened in her home in 1838.  By 1842
a new school was opened at Upper Salmon Beach.  The school measure 12
feet by 12 feet by 6 feet and housed 27 pupils.  School reports of
the time (1842, I believe) reported that:</p>
<p><br />

</p>
<ul>
	<li><p>her
	original license was issued in 1838</p></li>
	<li><p>her

	<li><p>summer

	<li><p>instruction

	<li><p>Margaret

	<li><p>She
	taught school for at least six years</p></li>
	<li><p>the
	new school measured 12 ft. By 12 ft. By 6 ft.</p></li>
	<li><p>furniture
	consisted of a small table and benches</p></li>
	<li><p>girls
	were taught sewing</p></li>
</ul>
<p><br />

</p>
<p>According
to the Bay Chaleur history, settlers raised sheep, carded and spun
wool and wove cloth.  Settlers of the Bay of Chaleur tell that John
Glendinning, presumably the Senior John, owned one of the first
weaving machines in Canobie and taught others in the community to
weave, however, I think that it is more likely that it was our
Grandmother who taught weaving.  I recall my mother saying that
Grandmother Glendenning possessed a shuttle.  Apparently, the shuttle
passed to Aunt Venetia Doring and from her to Cornelia Farrell.</p>
<p><br />

</p>
<p>According
to Pioneer Settlers, John and Margaret sold their land in 1855 to
Abram Buttimer and moved inland to Canobie.  We do not know the
reason for moving but we do know that waterfront land at Salmon Beach
took a heavy beating and some flooding from storms.  Also with a
growing family and cheap land he may have felt that he would give his
family a better start in Canobie.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 2in"><br />

</p>
<p align="justify"><br />

</p>
<p align="justify">John
Glendinning petitioned for two lots of 100 acres each in Canobie
(F5929, F5931)<u>.
 </u>One
petition shows the name as John Glendinning, Sr. and the other shows
only John Glendinning but in both cases the age is given as
forty-seven years so they are both the same person.  The petitions
are faint and difficult to read.</p>
<p align="justify"><br />

</p>
<p align="justify">One
petition identifies the year as 1854 and mentions the west half of
....  .  No lot number is given.  The lot was vacant but had been
improved by applicant.</p>
<p align="justify"><br />

</p>
<p align="justify">The
other petition, in 1855,  clearly identifies  lot #30 in Canobie
which appears to have been surveyed in 1848 for Charles Scott.  The
lot was vacant but improved - whether improved by John Glendinning,
Charles Scott, or someone else we do not know.</p>
<p><br />

</p>
<p><br />

</p>
<p>It
appears that John Glendinning petitioned for both Lots 30 and 31. 
When the grants were made, however, they were in the names of his
sons, John and Walter.  He and his family may have been living on the
lot since it was not unusual for early settlers to live on land for a
number of years before receiving title; they may have even been
required to clear a number of acres and even build a house.</p>

<p>On
March 2, 1872 Walter Glendenning, married Elizabeth Peters; on
February 17, 1873, Lot 30 was granted in Walter’s name.  It is
interesting to note that, while John, Sr. petitioned for the lots,
they were actually granted in the name of the sons.  Walter’s
father and mother continued to live with them until their deaths,
John, Sr died in 1877 leaving, as the 1881 census shows, Walter as
the head of the household:

Elizabeth
Peters, born in Canobie, was the daughter of John Peters (October 23,
1821 - June 31, 1904) and Jane (Sealy) Peters (December 24, 1821 -
September 12, 1892). According to a note in some family records, John
Peters and Jane Sealy were married in October of 1847 and lived all
their lives in Canobie, New Brunswick.</p>
<p lang="en-GB" align="justify" style="widows: 2; orphans: 2">

</p>
<p align="justify">Walter
Glendinning of the Parish of New Bandon petitioned (F9029) for one
hundred acres situate as follows: Lot No. 30, Canobie, formerly
surveyed for Charles Scott. By him transferred to John Glendinning
and from John Glendinning to his son Walter the present applicant. 
The land is said to be occupied by the applicant, Walter Glendinning,
and his father and improved by applicant and his father.  A notation
on the top of the petition shows 1865.  Interestingly, the top of
this form is pre-printed with the word “AUCTION”.  
</p>
<p align="justify">My
other source shows a grant of Lot #30 in Canobie to Walter
Glendenning on February 17, 1783.  That is quite a lag between the
making of a petition and the actual grant being made.</p>

<p align="justify" style="orphans: 2; widows: 2">The property is
directly across from the Canobie School, which is now the Women’s
Institute Hall.  The old home stood, among what is now a clump of
trees.  I believe that the homestead was inherited by his son,
Leonard; later generations knew the area as Leonard’s Hill.</p>

<p align="justify" style="orphans: 2; widows: 2">Walter
was active in the church including being a Sunday School teacher.  At
first, church services were held in the local school.  Later Trinity
Union Church was erected in 1899 about a mile from the Glendinning
property and was used by Presbyterians, Methodists and Anglicans. 
(It is now an Anglican Church).  Walter is reported to have been one
of the first trustees and, according to the Chaleur history, cut the
first lumber to start the building. It s a small church with 8-10
pews on each side.  The names of Mr. and Mrs. Walter  Glendenning are
included on a plaque in memory of the early church families.  (Mr.
and Mrs. John Glendenning’s names are also included)</p>

Walter
lived in Canobie and was active in community affairs. In 1882 he was
one of the people responsible for turnpiking a new road into the
Springfield Settlement.  He was also a successful farmer.</p>

successful farmer in his day.  At his death, he owned:</p>
