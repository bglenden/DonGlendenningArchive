<p>Hi Don,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>just a quick question.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Do you recognize the surname Shortel? Back in 2005 I was in touch with a Warren Forsythe regarding a Timothy F. Harley.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>His site is http://wc.rootsweb.com.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>His Harley relatives came from Cork Ireland and were in New Brunswick about the same time as the ones we are researching.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I will have to go back to his site and check it out as my memory not so great.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Also getting back to my Thomas, He was in the City of Toronto in 1934 just before Toronto became a city actually.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There was a special sitting on Feb 2 for the Common Council (I'm not sure what this is) but there was a petition of Thomas Harley for situation of Constable.</p>
<p>Feb 15th - Report #1 which was received and read viz constable Thomas Harley which the standing committee on offices beg to submit to the favourable consideration of the council.</p>
<p>Feb - 27 was turned down by common council for a full time job by a vote of 10 to 6.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Anyway this goes on but did you not mention you had relatives in York about the same time 1834 or so.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I tell you I'm expecting a new computer in a couple of days and I have been busy printing all my genealogy and it's all in a pile.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But I thought I remembered someone saying they had relatives in that area.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I also remember something of the Barnes family being Loyalists and I thought the Harley's might be also but this was something I haven't checked into yet.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Maybe that's how Thomas met Margaret.</p>
<p><br></p>

<p><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>After sending te other note, Ichecked the name Barnes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There are 8 entries: 4 from Westmoreland Co, one from each of York, Charlotte, Kings and Queens counties.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Given the dates, 1773-1786, they may have been Loyalists</p>

<p><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Yes I am trying to connect my Thomas to your William.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Thomas was born in Bandon Ireland and he landed in New Brunswick in 1833.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He was in the county of York before moving on and marrying Margaret Eleanor Barnes in the Georgetown area of Ontario, where he spent the remainder of his life.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I was going to look in my records to see if he was in the York area the same time as your family.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I will go through my notes tomorrow and give you a date.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I'm thinking perhaps they might be cousins but I have never proven that.</p>
