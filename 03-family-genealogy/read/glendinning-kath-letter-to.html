<p>Dear Mrs.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Glendinning:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Your request for information, #3515, in the Dumfries and Galloway Family History Society was passed to me by a Ian Glendinning.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I am a descendant of John Glendinning and Mary Rae through their son, John, who was my great Grandfather.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>John, my Great Grandfather, was born at Callister Hall in 1807, came to New Brunswick, Canada in 1830, married Margaret Harley in 1833 and died in 1877 in Canobie, New Brunswick.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Some years ago, I commenced an informal newsletter as a vehicle to pass along family information to my siblings.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I am enclosing the first issue for your information.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Since then my son, Brian, established a website and all issues of the newsletter are now found there although not all deal with family information., <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>HYPERLINK "http://www.glendenning.net/don" <span>www.glendenning.net/don</span>.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I also may be reached by Email at<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>HYPERLINK "mailto:don@glendenning.net" <span>don@glendenning.net</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>If you are interested, I would be delighted to share such information as I have about my branch of the family.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I am assuming that you have a family connection to John Glendinning and Mary Rae and, therefore, I would be interested in learning more about other branches of the family tree.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
<p><br></p>
