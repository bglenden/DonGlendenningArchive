<p><b>According to my sister Lillian</b>:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>An earthquake was felt in Black River in 1925</p>
<p>The person who put on the fire in the Little Branch school received $8.00 for the year</p>
<p>Sleds often carried a lantern hanging on the side so that they could be spotted by other drivers, especially during stormy weather.</p>
<p>Fred Fowlie was the first person to have a car in Black River and Harrison Smith was the first in Bayside.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Malcolm MacNaughton also had a car about the same time.</p>
<p>Dr. MacKenzie was the first one around to have a snowmobile; it was built out of a car and had runners on it. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>If someone needed a doctor, and they knew that Dr. MacKenzie was down river, they would hang a lantern at their gate so that the doctor would know to stop in.</p>
<p>Dad would drive through to Bathurst when there was grass showing in the center of the road</p>
<p>Dad would take the kids down to “Bay du Vin” night at Bernie Williston’s Beach where there would be dancing, fireworks and treats.</p>
<p>Dad used to resole the children’s shoes</p>
<p>Dad and John W. MacNaughton had a “rosser” (for peeling pulpwood)</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Cows were allowed to graze along the roads</p>
<p>A cyclone struck Black River in 1932 and blew the roof off Jimmy Major’s barn and also moved the Victoria Bridge on its piers</p>
<p>She was paid one cent for every hundred potato bugs she picked</p>
<p>Uncle Jim Watling had a “Star” car; he sold a device that was supposed to increase gas mileage in cars</p>
<p>Dad had his celluloid collars done at a Chinese laundry in Chatham</p>
<p>Grace taught herself to play the violin</p>
<p>Dad used to work in the canteen when there were dances in the Little Branch school</p>
<p>One year there were 53 children in the Branch school with one teacher</p>
<p>Dad hunted geese at the Finno field and the family had goose for Thanksgiving dinner</p>
<p>Dad and Harry Glendenning first met at a Farmers and Dairymen Convention in Woodstock, NB.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>(Uncle Harry lived in Shediac and, although not related, we visisted back and forth regularly – Ed.)</p>
<p>One of the older children used to walk part way to meet Mum and her siblings when returning from school at the Meadows because of the bears</p>
<p>There was a favourite watering hole for horses along the McKnight road</p>
<p>The Black River hall burned in 1932</p>
