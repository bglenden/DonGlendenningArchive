<div class="reader-summary">Don traces Victoria School&#x27;s history from early Black River instruction in Archibald Cameron Sr.&#x27;s barn, followed by home-based teaching. A formal school was erected in 1825 near the lane now leading to St. Stephen&#x27;s Church. Around 1845, the district divided with Cameron School at Middle Black River and another at Bayside. Victoria School&#x27;s construction date is unknown. The original Victoria School burned in the late 1940s and was replaced; the latter building later served as Mrs. Louise MacDougall&#x27;s residence. In 1939, Victoria School became one of seven schools in the Miramichi Rural High School district, offering grades 1-6. This documents educational infrastructure evolution across more than a century.</div>

<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Most
of the early settlers in Black River spoke Gaelic.  Based on the work
of A. W. McDougall, <u>Black
River and its First Settlers</u>,
the first instruction in Black River was provided in a barn belonging
to Archibald Cameron, Sr.  Following this, teachers provided
instruction in their own homes.  In 1825, residents petitioned
successfully for a school which, as I understand it, was erected near
the lane now leading to St. Stephen's Church.   This school appears
to have served all of Black River and as far east as Bay du Vin
although I do not know if students from the north side of the river
were included

<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">About
1845, the district was divided with one, the Cameron School, being
built at Middle Black River and another at Bayside (now Miramichi). 
A few years later a school was erected at Little Branch; I do not
know when the first Victoria school was erected.

<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">The
Victoria School, date of construction unknown, became one of seven
schools in the newly created Miramichi Rural High School district in
1939.  When the MRHS opened, grades one to six continued at the each
of the small schools; the new high school offered instruction in
Grades seven through eleven.  The original Victoria School burned,
probably in the late 1940’s, but was soon replaced.  The latter
school serves as the residence of Mrs. Louise MacDougall
