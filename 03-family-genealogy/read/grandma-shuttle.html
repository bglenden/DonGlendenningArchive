  Grandma Shuttle
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Don&#x27;s narrative from March 14, 2016 (New Symrna Beach, Florida), describing receiving a weaving shuttle from his first cousin Cornelia (Glendenning) Traetta that belonged to their Great Grandmother Margaret (Harley) Glendenning (1803-1895). Documents the shuttle&#x27;s journey from Ireland via Margaret&#x27;s migration in the 1820s, through Margaret&#x27;s grandson Walter, to Venetia Doring, then to Cornelia, and finally back to Don for donation to the New Brunswick Museum. Includes planned Facebook post text. Rich family heirloom story connecting Don to Irish heritage and frontier weaving traditions.</div>

<p><b>Grandma Glendenning’s shuttle</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>March 14, 2016</b></p>
<p><b>New Symrna Beach, Florida</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Ha a visit today from my first cousin, Cornelia (Glendenning) Traetta, and her husband, Bob, who live in Ormond Beach not far from here.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>During her visit she presented me with a shuttle that belonged to our Great Grandmother, Margaret (Harley) Glendenning. This is my understanding of the story.</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>The Harley’s been English but moved to Courtmacsherry, Ireland, where William Harley was believed to have been a school master.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>All the children (2 boys and 3 girls) came to New Brunswick in the 1820’s; Margaret (1803-1895) married John Glendinning in 1833 settling first at Salmon Beach; later they moved to Canobie.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Pioneer Settlers, a history of Canobie, tells us that settlers had sheep,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>spun their own wool and wove cloth; The book also says that John Glendenning had one of the first “weaving machines” (looms) in Canobie and taught many in<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>the community to weave, including Grandparents of Alma (Knowles) Glendenning.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Several family members including my mother, know/knew the story.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It certainly could even have been<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>a family heirloom given to Margaret prior to her departure for the New World.</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>The shuttle passed presumably through Margaret’s son, Walter, to granddaughter, Venetia (Glendenning) Doring who passed it to her niece, Cornelia (Glendenning) Traetta.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The story came up in a conversation a number of years ago, perhaps in the 1980’s, when visiting Bob and Cornelia; during the conversation, Cornelia left the room for a moment and returned with the shuttle.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In a telephone conversation, perhaps 3-4 years ago, Cornelia told me of a discussion with her family and the decision to return the shuttle to Canada.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The transfer was made today.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>The shuttle, measuring 111/4 x 11/8 z 7/8, tapered at both ends, is made of a dark wood like walnut and is in excellent condition.</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>My plan is to first put a photo and brief paragraph on Facebook and then donate it to the New Brunswick Museum, assuming the Museum is interested.</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Facebook</b></p>
<p><b>This shuttle is believed to have been brought to Canada from Ireland by my Great Grandmother, Margaret (Harley) Glendenning (1803-1895) in the 1820’s.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Pioneer Settlers, a history of Canobie, N.B. mentioned that John and Margaret had a loom and taught others in the community to weave. The shuttle measures 12 x 11/8 x7/8 and is made of a dark wood, believed to be walnut. The shuttle was passed by Venetia (Glendenning) Doring to Cornelia (Glendenning) Traetta who, in turn, gave it to me for return to Canada.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I intend to donate to the New Brunswick Museum.</b></p>
