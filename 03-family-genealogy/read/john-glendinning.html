<div class="reader-summary">Genealogical documentation of John Glendinning Sr. (Elmer&#x27;s grandfather) and son Walter; legal petition records for land grants in Canobie, NB. Documents John Sr.&#x27;s two petitions (1854/1855) for 100-acre lots with notation of &quot;forty-seven years&quot; age in both petitions; lots were vacant but improved by applicant. Walter&#x27;s petition (1865 notation, pre-printed &quot;AUCTION&quot; header) for Lot 30 Canobie, showing land transfer lineage from Charles Scott to John Glendinning to Walter. Notes significant lag between petition and actual grant (Walter&#x27;s grant dated February 17, 1873). John Jr. land grant record (Lot 31, August 17, 1868). Includes tangential historical note: &quot;The Pious Pirate&quot; - San Salvador Island&#x27;s Watling Castle, named Captain George Watling (buccaneer/&quot;pious pirate&quot; forbidding Sabbath card play/piracy), confirming no Watling family pirate connection. Brief final section on Grandfather Glendenning&#x27;s land holdings itemization from will: 100-acre homestead (Lot 30, inherited by Leonard), 100 acres Canobie (Lot 28, to wife Elizabeth), Stevens Farm 100 acres (to wife with proviso to son Raymond if he settled Canobie), Taylor Farm 50 acres (to wife, eventually inherited/sold to daughter Venetia, then Matt Ellis). Primarily legal/archival document rather than narrative biography.</div>

<p><b>John Glendinning, Sr.</b> (F5929, F5931)</p>
<p><span></span><br></p>
<p>John Glendinning, my Great Grandfather petitioned for two lots of 100 acres each in Canobie.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>One petition shows the name as John Glendinning, Sr. and the other shows only John Glendinning but in both cases the age is given as <span>A</span>forty-seven years<span>@</span> so they are both the same person.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The petitions are faint and difficult to read.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>One petition identifies the year as 1854 and mentions the <span>A</span>west half of<span>@</span> ....<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>No lot number is given.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The lot was vacant but had been improved by applicant.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The other petition, in 1855,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>clearly identifies<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>lot #30 in Canobie which appears to have been surveyed in 1848 for Charles Scott.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The lot was vacant but improved - whether improved by John Glendinning, Charles Scott, or someone else we do not know.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Walter Glendinning</b> (F9029)</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Walter Glendinning of the Parish of New Bandon petitioned for one hundred acres situate as follows: <span>A</span>Lot No. 30, Canobie, formerly surveyed for Charles Scott. By him transferred to John Glendinning and from John Glendinning to his son Walter the present applicant.<span>@</span><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The land is said to be occupied by the applicant, Walter Glendinning, and his father and improved by applicant and his father.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A notation on the top of the petition shows 1865.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Interestingly, the top of this form is pre-printed with the word <span>A</span>AUCTION<span>@</span>. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>My other source shows a grant of Lot #30 in Canobie to Walter Glendenning on February 17, 1783.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That is quite a lag between the making of a petition and the actual grant being made.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>John Glendenning</b><b></b></p>
<p><span></span><br></p>
<p>While I did not find a petition from John Glendinning, Jr.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My reference shows a grant to John Glendenning of Lot #31 on August 17, 1868.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>The Pious Pirate</b><b></b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>San Salvador Island is part of the Bahamas.<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>On Sandy Point sits Watling Castle.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The island was originally named Watling<span>=</span>s Island in honour of Captain George Watling a famous buccaneer and pirate.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>(It was renamed in 1926).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He was also known as the <span>A</span>pious pirate<span>@</span> because he would not allow his crew to play cards or indulge in piracy on the Sabbath.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The name Watling appears frequently in literature about the Bahamas.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There may have also been a pirate named John Watling.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I am sure that neither of these were part of our family.

<p><b>Grandfather</b><span><b>=</b></span><b>s Land Holdings</b><b></b></p>
<p><span></span><br></p>
<p>In addition to the 100 acre homestead (Lot #30) mentioned earlier in this Newsletter which he left to his son, Leonard, Grandfather Glendenning, according to his will, also owned:</p>
<p><span></span><br></p>
<p>100 acres in Canobie, which I believe to be Lot #28, which he left to his wife, Elizabeth. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>the <span>A</span>Stevens Farm<span>@</span> in Canobie containing 100 acres which he left to his wife, Elizabeth, with the proviso that it be transferred to his son Raymond if he returned to settle in Canobie.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This property is bounded on the west by the Springfield Road and is the land where Raymond later settled.</p>
<p>50 acres, the original Taylor Farm, which he left to his wife Elizabeth.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This property is immediately west of and adjoins the Stevens farm.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Apparently this land was left to or purchased by his daughter. Venetia.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Guy Glendenning said that Venetia sold the property to Matt. Ellis</p>
