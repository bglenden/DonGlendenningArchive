<div class="reader-summary">A short note on Jubal Watling&#x27;s land petition (F4243) dated April 9, 1851, requesting 50 acres on the south side of Black River. Documents the petition&#x27;s status uncertainties and notes a later grant of 100 acres (Lot #30) in the Meadows to Jubal Watling Jr. on April 20, 1881. Identifies conflicting information in different sources and Don&#x27;s hope to resolve discrepancies with further research. **NOT originally written by Don** — this is a documentary note on archival records.</div>
