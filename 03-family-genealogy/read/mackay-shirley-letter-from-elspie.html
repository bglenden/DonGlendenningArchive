<p>	Black River, Feb. 8<sup>th</sup>/43</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Dear John:</p>
<p><span class="Apple-converted-space">     </span>I do like to think that the winter is getting shorter each day. Soon be the middle of the month.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>We have had some warm days. Had some rain, and today was like spring. Colder again tonight.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The snow plow is up to Dicks. I think he must be staying there tonight. It will be nice to have an<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>open road again. I was to Newcastle and Chatham today. Doug Campbell cane in to the crossroads,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>and Gordon MacNaughton, brought me down from there. The Roads in Newcastle are like spring,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>pools of water. I had 20 doz. Of eggs out, but the price is down now to .30 cents.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><span class="Apple-converted-space">     </span>Our chickens are more than working. The men are still hauling off their logs. Said it would take them this week. He is going to Bartibogue tomorrow to run a line for Kerr Loggie. He has to go to Redbank, this week too.</p>
<p><span class="Apple-converted-space">     </span>What is Clifford doing? I just heard he had been called. Carlyle Edge, Boston has been called too. He is coming home for a visit, before he goes. He lives with his Aunt Cassie.</p>
<p><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Bob MacDonald met with a nasty hurt, on Friday. He was coming in from town, with Jack Dick, in a sled. They were sitting on a board, you know the way, they make a seat on a sled. Just a narrow margin of the seat over the side of the sled. A car came along at a great speed, caught the end of the seat., twitched it around, and jammed Bob's leg. Gave him a compound fracture, below the knee. The bone cut through the flesh. Arch his brother took him to the hospital. They reported it to the Mounties and they got the men. They had never stopped. I believe they were so drunk, they upset the car twice before they got to St. Margarets. The last time they turned it in the ditch. The police took possession fo the car. The owner was a man from St. John, Provincial salesman for the Irving Oil Co., and a young chap from Newcastle, who was getting a ride to St. John. He was doing the driving.</p>
<p>They say he is a splendid man this Dolan, and had a great job. Probably be lost to him now. I hope they get something out of it for Bob. It was a narrow escape for both Bob and Jack Dick, another couple of inches, he would have hit the sled. There will be a charge of drunken driving anyway. Doug Galloway is spending three months in Jail, for a charge like that.</p>
<p><span class="Apple-converted-space">     </span>What do you think of the President, and Churchill gallivanting. They are two great sports. I hope their plans will work out. The German are getting it hot from the Russians. Some people seem to think that Stalin will attack England when she gets enough to the Germans. I hope it is not in their mind.</p>
<p><span class="Apple-converted-space">      </span>How is the food situation getting along? I think you people are harder hit on gas, over there that we are. This butter rationing is a nuisance. I can never get quite used to it. A letter from mac last week, all well. I hope<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>to hear soon what Clifford is doing. I’ll be writing Nina.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>	</p>
<p>Love to all. Mother</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Jean's little girl is Norma Fay, they call her Norma.</p>
