Robert MacBeath, Enoch Godfrey's Father-in-law died in 1823, I am quite sure he was the first one buried on the church point.

A falling log killed Duncan MacNaughton in 1824, and he is the second one buried there.

This piece of land was used as the regular cemetery, even though it still belonged to Enoch Godfrey until 1836.

At a meeting of the inhabitants of the Black River district held at the home of Archibald Cameron on the 10th of November, 1834, the following person were appointed to use all due efforts for the erection of a church on Alexander Gunn's point, being a part of Lot # 4.

Deed between Enoch Godfrey and St Stephans Church, Vol. 36, Page 25, Lot # 4. Glenelg Parish Indenture # 12.

Deed For First Church Property. The deed was written on November 17, 1836 between Enoch Godfrey and his wife Elizabeth MacBeath on one part and the trustees of St. Stephans Church of the other part. Enoch and his wife Elizabeth for good cause and consideration and for the sum of five shillings sells to the trustees that part of Lot # 4 bounded as follows. Commencing at a stake standing 153 feet south, 82 degrees west of the south west corner of the church which already exists, and running south 30 degrees east two hundred and ninety seven feet to the river, then following the northerly edge of the river until it makes a line running north 60 degrees east of the above mentioned stake, then south 60 degrees west 287 feet to the place of beginning the above mentioned piece of land containing one acre. Signed by Enoch Godfrey and his wife Elizabeth Godfrey. Witnessed by Alexander Davidson and Simon Fraser. Registered November 21, 1836

Church Opening. The church now being fully completed, on the 20th day of November 1836, was formerly opened and set apart for the worship of God. The Rev. Mr. Fraser preached from Psalm 137, verses 5 and 6. On this occasion it was decided to name the church, and as it was customary to take the name of a saint, the name given to that of Black River was St. Stephan.

Rev. Simon Fraser served the charge until 12th of April, 1840 when he preached his final sermon here.

Financial Difficulties. Rev. Angus MacMaster came to Black River and Kouchibouguac in 1842, his salary to be one hundred and thirty pounds a year, one third to be paid by Kouchibouguac. Up to the end of Rev Angus MacManster's pastorate in June 1845 only one hundred and five pounds had been paid to him. In order to pay him the balance of two hundred and eighty five pounds, still owing, It became necessary to borrow the money.

Three of the trustees were appointed to transact the business of raising the money for Rev. MacMaster. These men had to give their note for the money. When the notes came due, only one of the men was in a position to pay. So Alexander Cameron from Cameron Mills in Kent County had to pay the entire bill himself.

As no progress was being made in paying of the loan from Alexander Cameron. In the spring of 1863 a special meeting called for the purpose of settling the quote on Alexander Cameron who was still living in Cameron Mills, Kent Co. about forty miles from Black River, was requested to attend the meeting, which he did. The meeting ended has had all previous meetings in failure. Mr. Cameron, whose patience was exhausted, at once went to Newcastle and had the Sheriff seize the church building and the grounds.

Sale of Church Property. This land would be the acre as described in the deed from Enoch Godfrey to the trustees of the church, written November 17, 1836.

Also a tract of woodland, about four hundred acres, known as the Glebe lot, situated up the little Branch of Black River, which belonged to the congregation. 


The above mentioned property was advertised for sale. The sale took place in May 1863. Many of the congregation took the view that the sale was illegal, so no bids were offered. So the lands were sold to Alexander Cameron for the sum of one dollar. And the Sheriff James Mitchell gave him a deed, bearing the date May 16th, 1863, of the property.

The people were never stopped from using the church by the new owner, but the woodlands, which in former years brought some revenue to the church from the sale of lumber was now, lost to them.

Alexander Cameron died 23rd of May 1870. In his will he wished to bequeath the Church building and the acre of land, to the Free Church. Not the established Presbyterian Church of Scotland. The Free Church not being incorporated could not officially own property. So the property went to his son James Cameron.

Enoch Godfrey died intestate, so the family agreed to an indenture made the 4th November 1867. Between Robert Godfrey and his wife Grace, Henry Godfrey and his wife Jane, John A. Godfrey and his wife Isabel on the first part, and William Godfrey on the second part, for and in consideration of the sum of five shillings of lawful money of New Brunswick to the said Robert Godfrey, Henry Godfrey, John A.Godfrey, paid by William Godfrey, The receipt whrerof is hereby acknowledged, do grant, bargain, sell and confirm unto the said William Godfrey that parcel of land, bounded as follows; commencing on the bank of the river at the upper side line of Lot # 3 granted to John MacLean, deceased, thence southerly along the west side of Lot # 3 to the rear there of the westerly along base line about forty six rods, or one half the width of  Lot # 3, then northerly in a line parallel with the side line to the south side of the creek.
