Elmer, the second child and first son to Walter and Elizabeth (Peters) Glendenning, was born in Canobie on land that is now a grove of trees directly across the road from the Canobie School, now the Women's Institute Hall.   Baptismal record shows birthdate as June 10, 1875
\par 
\par It is likely that he went to the one room school on a corner of his Uncle's farm next door since the family seems to have valued education; this is not surprising in that his grandmother was a teacher and lived in the home until Elmer was 20.  As further evidence, his brother, Chip took a business course, Guy studied but did not finish dentistry and Margaret trained as a nurse.  It is likely that Dad took some technical courses while in Portland; I remember some engineering books at home.  His oldest sister, Venetia, provided a home for his sister, Margaret, so that she could finish high school in Portland; I believe that Uncle Guy also completed high school there; maybe others did as well.    
\par 
\par Elmer's father was a farmer and, judging by the amount of land accumulated, a successful one at that.  Elmer, and all the boys, and maybe even the girls, would be expected to do their share.  The land would have to be cleared of trees, and those who know Canobie, will remember the stony fields; and all the work would be done by hand or with the aid of horses.
\par 
\par At that time he probably knew people, even friends, who went to Maine or New Hampshire during the winter to work in the woods and then return to farm and fish in the summer; he may have even done that himself.  
\par 
\par The Glendennings were well established in Portland in the first decade of the 1900s. Frank moved there in 1898 and Elmer by 1901. Venetia, the oldest child, seems to have played the role of "host" as each new family member moved south.  Venetia lived in Falmouth Foreside which is between Portland and Freeport.  Other siblings known to have lived in Portland, at least for a while, include Margaret, Raymond and Guy.   In addition, Maude and her husband, Jim Cormier lived in Lincoln, New Hampshire where Uncle Jim Cormier worked in the mill, and Leonard and his family lived in Maine.  We also know, for example, that his Aunt, Mary Ann (Harley) who had married a Stevens and lived next door in Canobie, had moved to Portland to be with family after her husband died in 1870.   Land grant records show that Lot # 28 in Canobie, 100 acres, was granted to Atton E. Glendenning on 1901-07-06.  .
\par 
\par Prior to his marriage in 1910, we know that Elmer, his brother, Frank, and likely brothers Ray and Guy operated a trucking business under the name Glendenning Bros. & Co. (All Kinds of Team Work) at 24 Hammond Street. They had horses and wagons and did all kinds of hauling.  Portland was the winter terminus of the Great Northern Railway, later the CNR, which meant that much goods would be moved, in all kinds of combinations, from trains, ships to warehouses, retail stores and homes.  One role Dad told about was that of delivering ice to homes. Elmer also had crews of men and horses in the woods in  winter, we believe in both Maine and new Hampshire, but possibly also in Vermont.  Other people from Black River worked with him including his brother-in-law, James A. Watling  and Ramsay MacLean (a nephew of Adam MacLean who was married to Elmer's first cousin. Millie.)  According to Herbert Daley, Herb Daley, Dad's first cousin, also worked in the woods with Elmer.  
\par 
\par In the first decade of the 20th century, Elmer and his brothers operated a cartage business in Portland, Maine.  I believe that his brother, Frank, was a partner in the business and others may have been as well.  Bobby Glendenning believes said that his father, Guy, worked in the business and brother Ray worked with them as a blacksmith.  By 1910, Elmer was working on the Rothschild dam in Wausau, Wisconsin from where, on January 25, 1910, he mailed "Jeannie Glendenning" in Portland; some dams were being built to improve the rafting of logs; others were built for the generation of power.  
\par 
\par Elmer and Jane were married in Litle Branch in 1910 and returned to Portland, however, by February 1911 they were living in Parksville, Tennessee where Elmer worked on Ocoee #1, the first of three dams build on the Ocoee River. Later Mum and Dad moved up the Ocoee River to Caney Creek where a second dam was built.  (This project included the construction of a flume line to carry water for five  miles over valleys and along rocky ledges to a head pond with a drop of 250 feet to the turbines below.)  The flume line is still in existence and designated as a national historic site.  Over the next few years they moved from construction site to construction site in Hampton, Virginia, Mussel Shoals. Alabama, North Haven, Connecticut,   Dad also worked for a while in Abiline, Texas but I do not believe that Mum moved there.   Probably the other major project was in Virginia where Elmer was in charge of the clearing of Langley Field which, I believe, handled both sea and land based airplanes.  It was a defense establishment and, I believe they lived on th site; people needed passes when returning to the site; Venetia's pass was for 1918, I do not know the year of Lillian's pass.  Dad worked in Mussell Shoals likely either at the Wilson Dam or at the nearby nitrate plant.  At the same time, we have evidence that Uncle Frank worked at Plant No. 1, US Nitrate Co. in Sheffield Alabama.  He was working  for the J. G. White Engineering Co, which is the same one Dad worked for in Hampton, Virginia.
\par 
\par On July 21, 1914, Elmer bought the Jessie MacDonald property at Little Branch  and they move there during late 1913 or early 1914  (The property passed from Jessie to her nephew, Alexader from whom Dad made the purchase)   Elmer beame post master in 1914 but resigned in 1916 and moved to Fairhaven, Connecticut where they lived at 3 Perkins Street.  By 1919, they took up permanent residence at their home in Little Branch.  Over the years he purchased a number of other properties, one for each of his sons.
\par 
\par Like others in Black River, they operated a mixed farm that included cows, pigs, hens, geese, horses, turkeys; crops included a farm garden, oats, barley, wheat, buckwheat, and hay.  Cash was scarce; most of their business was accomplished thriugh barter of eggs, chickens,, beef, pork, the sale of weaners (Piglets four to six weeks old), geese, turkeys, ducks, bales of hay, bags of grain, cream, potatoes, furnace wood, and butter, etc.  In addition, the  farm ensured that the family had meat and potatoes for their own use.  For a while he had a team of oxen which he used around the farm.  Lillian remembers using them to haul sap from back on the "ridge".
\par 
\par Elmer active in the community including the building of St. Paul's Presbyterian Church (on June 14, 1926 was elected to the first Board of Managers) , was a prime mover in the construction of a community hall.  The first hall was opened in 1931 and burned to the ground in 1932.  A second hall was built in 1933.  He was active in the Orange Lodge, Oddfellows, and Masons.
\par 
\par In addition to farming, he and his brother-in-law, John W. MacNaughton operated a pulp business. They operated a "rosser", a machine for peeling pulp in Middle Black River, across from the Cameron School, and operated lumber camps in St. Margaret's and the Black River area.  He continued to be active in construction and built the bridge at John Godfrey's and John Dick's. His last job away from home was the construction of Tinker Dam near Woodstock, NB
\par 
\par Elmer Glendenning was known as a hard worker. He built and repaired his own harness, re-soled the children's shoes, and made axe handles. Even when he was not able to work, Brydone Weeks told that Dad had himself taken to the field in a wheelbarrow where he sharpened the scythes while the men were cutting marsh hay.  Dad suffered for a number of years with pernicious anaemia (or was it leukemia ?).  Walter remembers the wagon rack breaking one evening when coming from the woods with a load of wood.  Later he and Dad returned to the woods, unloaded the wood, cut poles, repaired the wagon rack, and returned home so that the wagon load of wood was ready to be taken to Loggieville the next day.  Part of the repair work was carried out by the light of a lantern.  Lillian remembers Dad up on the roof shingling at daybreak.  
\par 
\par Dad was a founding member of an Agricultural Society (#103) and was its Secretary Treasurer for fourteen years.  An Agricultural Society, and there were many throughout the Province,  was like a Co-op.  Farmers banded together and bought seeds, lime and fertilizer, etc. in bulk and sold it to themselves
\par 
\par It is interesting that Dad's name sometimes appears as Alton Elmer and other times as Elmer Alton Glendenning.  Although I have not seen a birth certificate, my earliest references are to Elmer Alton Glendenning.  
\par 
\par Venetia's clippings included the following believed to have been taken from the Moncton Times:
\par 
\par "CHATHAM,May 22 - The community of Black River and the Miramichi generally will learn with deep regret of the death of Elmer A. Glendenning at his home Black River Bridge.  For 14 years he had been the energetic secretary-treasurer of the progressive Agricultural Society of that district.  For over a quarter of a century  he has been a member of the Masonic Order; for 30 years enjoyed membership in the Oddfellows Craft, and for the long period of 43 years was a member of the Loyal Orange Lodge.
\par Surviving are his wife (formerly Miss. Jean Watling of Black River and nine children.  There are four daughters, Mrs. Roy Smith of Medford, Mass., Mrs Cameron Russell of Point Aux Carr, Lillian of Needham, Mass., and Elinor at home, an infant daughter, Margaret Virginia was buried in Hampton, Virginia in 1918; five sons, Walter, John, Kenneth, Norman and Don, all at home.  
\par The funeral of the late Mr. Glendenning was held yesterday afternoon at 2:30 o'clock with Dr. Genge of Calvin Church, Chatham, officiating.  Interment was made in St. Stephen's Cemetery, Black River."

Jane was the second youngest of a family of eight born to Jubal Watling and Grace (MacAskill) MacDonald, born, presumably at home, at the Meadows, Upper Black River, New Brunswick.  She was named after Jane Elizabeth Jardine , daughter of John Jardine, (1836-1912)who married Donald Cameron (Cameron Russell's grandmother)
\par 
\par When she was about 10 years old, the family moved from the Meadows to Little Branch.  She attended the Upper Black River school and later the school at Little Branch. 
\par 
\par Jane arrived in Portland on January 24, 1908 just prior to her 18th birthday.   Jane arrived in the early morning of January 24, 1908 and waited for her brother, George, to meet her. Apparently he came to the station but did not recognize her.   She had grown up while he was away from Black River.  Her brother Jack also worked in Portland at that time and likely there were many cousins. We also know that her brother Jim worked in Portland in a chemist/pharmacy, and also in photography, but whether he was there at that time we do not know.  
\par 
\par Among Mum's possessions was an envelope, addressed in Dad's handwriting and mailed from Wisconsin, showing Mum's address as 130 Emery Street, Portland.
\par 
\par She married Elmer Glendenning on October 18, 1910 and returned to the US where they lived and worked for the next nine years; .Information about this period is found in the notes about Elmer.
\par 
\par In Black river, Jane was active in her church, the Women's Missionary society and the Women's league.  She was also a long time member of the women's institute.  She liked to read and, in the early years at least, wrote poetry.
\par 
\par After 28 years of marriage, Jane Elizabeth Jardine (Watling) became a widow in 1939; she was 48 at the time.  The two oldest daughters, Grace and Venetia, were married and living elsewhere; her daughter, Lillian, was living and working in the Boston area.  Elinor and the five boys, the youngest being nine years old, were living at home.
\par 
\par The next decade, the wartime years, brought a number of significant changes to the community.  The commencement of classes, and the construction of the Miramichi Rural High School, allowed young people of the community to continue their schooling to the end of high school while continuing to live at home; before this, the nearest high school was in Loggieville, eleven miles away.  The looming war resulted in the construction of an airbase at Chatham, a radar station at St. Margaret's, and a bombing range on the road to Loggieville.  These developments meant a significant growth of non-farm jobs for the community.  The outbreak of hostilities also soon resulted in sons, sons-in-law, neighbours, relatives and friends entering the armed forces.  The decade also brought improved roads, regular bus service to Chatham and electric lights.  By the end of the decade, Black River had moved from a barter to a cash economy.
\par 
\par Although the sons continued to operate the family farm for the next decade, the decade also brought significant changes to the family;  Walter finished building his house on the Dan MacLean property, married and moved out; Lillian returned to New Brunswick and married; Elinor, Kenneth, Norman and Don attended the new Miramichi High School; Walter, Kenneth and Norman served in the armed forces; John, after operating the farm during the war, married, built a house and moved to the Bob MacLean property; Elinor married and moved out; Kenneth returned from military service, married and moved away; Don finished high school and entered teaching; Norman married and settled on the home place.    
\par 
\par Jane continued to be active in the community generally and encouraged her family and others to do the same.  She was especially active in her church, the Women's Missionary Society, the Presbyterian League and the Women's Institute.  She believed in education and supported the construction of a high school for the area; she also encouraged her family and others to continue their schooling. (It is interesting to note that the Miramichi Rural High School was the first rural high school in the Province; immediately following WW2, the number grew rapidly with, I believe, federal financial support, until there were approximately 50 rural high schools throughout the New Brunswick.)   
\par 
\par Norman and Jean married in 1951 and Mum continued to live with them until she died in 1964. Mum died in the Miramichi Hospital of cancer of the pancreas having been in the hospital only about two weeks.  
\par 
\par The following vignettes are intended to round out the picture of Mother, her interests, activities and passions:
\par 
\par 1\tab While discussing VE Day with Vance MacNaughton in June of 1995 at the shopping mall in Douglastown, he told Ken and I about his memory of VE Day (May 8, 1944).  As readers will know, the Little Branch School was down the road and across the brook from home.  Vance was a student in the school at the time when, suddenly, there was a knock and, without waiting for a response, the door flew open the school door flew open and Mum announced to teacher and students alike "The War is over".  
\par 2\tab Mother had no formal training as a nurse but made herself available and was frequently called upon by others in the community in time of need such as for a birth or death in a family.  
\par 3\tab Her " pin money" came from trading wool for yarn.  The wool was wash in rainwater heated on the kitchen stove, carried to the front yard, washed and rinsed several times and spread on the grass to dry then gathered up and bagged.  down into the grass and, therefore, being difficult to gather and bag when dry. The bags wool were loaded into the Model A Ford and taken to Brown's Woolen Mills in Nelson where it would be made into yarn.  She bartered her wool for skeins of yarn in colours, but mostly in white or grey. She knitted mitts and socks for the family, and sometimes for Christmas gifts, and sold surplus yarn to neighbours and, I think, she had some customers by mail.
\par 
\par 4\tab Bread was a staple and a large family required many loaves of bread each week.  The recipe was mixed in a large, round blue-enamelled, bread pan.  A cake of Fleischmann's yeast was "started" in a cup of warm water.  The dough was made into loaves, set in a warm place to rise, and then put in the oven to bake.  My recollection is that she would make 7 loaves at a time twice a week.  
\par 
\par 5\tab Mother loved to have visitors.  There were a half-dozen at every meal and putting up a meal for 15 after church on Sunday, or any other day, did not faze her a bit or if it did, she did not let on.  I cannot ever even once remember her saying, I wish they hadn't or wouldn't come today.  Meals were not fancy but they were always tasty.  Of course, when the visitors were family, the daughters or daughters-in-law, pitched in to help.
\par 
\par 6\tab Oil lamps were tended early each day so that, when night fell, there was no scramble for a light.  We had three oil lamps plus, in later years, an Aladdin lamp.  Lamps were filled with kerosene, wicks were trimmed, globes were wiped first with an old newspaper to remove the soot, then washed, dried and replaced.  When finished, the kerosene lights were placed on a shelf beside the clock high on the kitchen wall.   The Aladdin lamp used gas, naphtha?, and did not require such daily care. 
\par 
\par 7\tab Securing food for the coming winter was a major concern in a household.  While Mother had no special role in the planting or harvesting, she played the major role in pressuring food for winter.  The first step was to have a good garden, which resulted in potatoes, carrots and turnips stored in bins in the basement.  Carrots were a bit more complex and were usually stored in sand in the basement.  Apples were stored in a cold bedroom, usually the large bedroom over the driveway.  Some preserves were put up - peaches, cucumber pickles, chow and mustard beans.  Several baskets of peaches were purchased and these were bottled along with some strawberries, blueberries and maybe even raspberries.  
\par 
\par St. Stephen's Presbyterian Church annual report for 1910 includes the following:
\par  
\par "GLENDENNING-WATLING - At the home of the bride's parents, on October 18, Alton Elmer Glendenning of Bathurst and Jane Elizabeth Watling of Little Branch".
\par 
\par I have the following clipping, date and newspaper unknown:
\par 
\par "DEATH MRS. E. GLENDENNING - CHATHAM (Special) - "The death of Mrs. Jean Elizabeth Jardine Glendenning, 74, widow of Elmer A. Glendenning of Black River Bridge, occurred at Miramichi Hospital Newcastle, Wednesday, following a brief illness.

Lillian said that Grace attended Armstrong School in Parksville, Tenn
\par 
\par Grace was the oldest in the family and was born in Parksville, Tennessee.  Dad and Mum had set up housekeeping there in February 1911 where Dad worked on Ocoee #1, the first of three dams build on the Ocoee River.  Aunt Janet had journeyed to Parksville to be with Mum when Grace was born.  
\par 
\par  When Grace was young, Dad and Mum moved from construction site to construction site in the US and, presumably, Grace attended school wherever she was; one school was the Armstrong School but I am not sure if it was in Connecticut or Virginia.  The family returned to NB in 1919 and, again, presumably Grace attended the Little Branch School.  Later she attended Success Business College in Moncton, NB where she took a business program.  While she made good marks, apparently she did not like the program.  It was when returning from Business College with Grace, that Dad upset the Model T at Gilbert's Corner, near Shediac.  Grace broke her wrist but even so, went to a dance in the Little Branch School that night.
\par 
\par Like so many other Maritimers, Grace went to Boston to work, probably in 1930 and worked for various families caring for children and likely cooking.  . On her first trip, she traveled with Mrs. F. A. Fowlie and Ernest MacLean who were going to Lowell, Mass to visit relatives.  She may have she stayed for a while with Dad's cousin, Sam Knowles.  At one time she lived at 1595 Beacon Street, Beverley, Mass. She frequently visited her Uncle Jack Watling in Boston and later when he lived on Swan's Island near Eastport, Maine.  Grace returned regularly to Little Branch for the summer coming sometimes by steamer from Boston to Saint John, NB.  (I believe that the fare to Saint John was $10.00)  In 1947, when I left home for Teachers' College in Fredericton, I inherited Grace's steamer trunk - and it carried my belongings on a number of later trips.
\par 
\par As a young woman in Little Branch and later in Boston, Grace loved to square dance; Lillian said that the night she landed in Boston in 1933, she went to a dance with Grace.  Perhaps that is where she met Roy Morrison Smith (1908-1985).   Roy, I believe, preferred to round dance.   She and Roy were married in St. Paul's Presbyterian Church on August 26, 1936.  In 1936, Walter, Dad, Elinor and I drove to Boston to bring Grace home.    After marriage, Grace and Roy lived with Roy's mother in Saugus, Mass, later moving to 23 Spring Street in Malden. While in Saugus, Grace worked for Chisholm's Motel on Route 1.   One evening while standing on the sidewalk near her home in Malden talking to a neighbour, a man came along, knocked her off her feet and stole her purse.  
\par 
\par 
\par Grace, Roy and family were frequent visitors to Little Branch and even when they could not come, their children made the trip.  My recollection is that Barbara and Lawrence spent 16 consecutive summers with their Grandmother at Little Branch.  Often they came by train but also frequently traveled with expatriate New Brunswick folk who were visiting family in the Miramichi.  I can remember being wakened in the middle of the night when Grace arrived home.  She had brought some clothes for me and wanted to see them on me.  The story is told that one summer when Grace was home and helping with the cooking and Ken was a toddler, Grace would jam Ken's dress in the pantry door in order to keep him out of her way.  In later years, Grace frequently landed home carrying shopping bags with fresh tomatoes from Roy's garden, bagels for Jean MacKenzie and the usual things for family members.  
\par 
\par Grace had extraordinary eyesight. While walking through a field she could reach down and pick a four leaf clover. One time she entered a contest, which required her to count the dots in a picture of a TV.  She won, and then decided she should count the dots again in case she was asked the number at the presentation ceremony.  I know that she also won other contests but cannot recall which ones.  As a youngster, I can recall going with Grace and others to pick blueberries and raspberries and of walking through the fields.  I am not sure if we were going somewhere or just for a walk. 
\par Although she left New Brunswick as a young woman, she did not lose interest in family, friends or the community.  She subscribed to the Chatham Gazette for many years and was well informed about activities among her extended family. She was proud of her family, fiercely loyal, generous to a fault and she and Roy always welcomed and provided shelter for the many visiting family members.  She was quick to arrange for visitors to see the Museum of Science, visit down town Boston, see the Saugus Iron works, etc.  
\par 
\par During her later years Grace had a form of multiple sclerosis and had difficulty walking.  She then moved to Cliffside Nursing Home and Winthrop, Mass.  She is buried in the Black River Cemetery.
\par 
\par The Moncton times of August 10, 1991 carried the following:
\par 
\par "Mrs. Grace E Smith, 80 of Malden, Mass., and formerly of Black River Bridge, died Thursday in Malden following a lengthy illness.

Walter was born in New Brunswick; Mother had come back from Tennessee to New Brunswick for his birth and may have stayed in NB until late 1916 - we do not know for sure. The family returned permanently to Little Branch in 1919 and it is likely that is where Walter started school -.  It is likely that he only went to school for 6-8 years and then would have worked with Dad on the farm. 
\par 
\par Walter did not talk much about his early years but I know that he worked long hours both summer and winter.  Because Dad was such a worker and Walter was the oldest boy in the family, I am sure that a great deal was expected of him.  He had a team of dogs, Chowder and Pup, which he hitched to a sled in winter and traveled around the community, and cross to visit Alex Newton.  Once he took Dad across to George Adams' to use the phone. The longest trip, Walter said, was to John W. MacNaughton's - a distance of about 7 miles.  
\par 
\par Canobie and Black River Glendenning family members kept in touch and visited back and forth. One time, the Christmas, 1938 I believe, Walter was taking family members to Chatham in the Model A.  The right front window was broken and was replaced with a piece of cardboard.  Seems to me that Mum, Ken, Norm, Lillian and I were in the car.  As we neared the railroad tracks, Walter spotted a train approaching from the right.  He tried to stop but the car kept sliding towards the tracks.  Quick thinking, he tramped on the gas instead and got across just ahead of the train.  People on the back of Adams' truck just ahead of us were sure that we were going to be hit.
\par 
\par Walter began building a home on the Dan MacLean place in 1937 and moved into it on November 1, 1940.  In the meantime, they lived at Little Branch.  The basement was dug with the aid of a horse, Jess, and a scoop and most if not all of the lumber came from Hallidays.  The original barn on the property burned in 1932, the same year as the Black River Hall.  His house was struck by lightning in 1940 but did not burn.
\par 
\par Although Walter farmed, he also worked off the farm.  In 1940 he worked at clearing the bombing range along the Loggieville Road.  He was called to the Army Service Corps during the war and was stationed at Ottawa, Halifax, Debert and Camp Borden.  On his return, he continued to farm and to work at the airport.  In 1950 he commenced work with Modern Construction Co. Ltd. In 1959 he moved to Moncton and continued to work for Modern at job sites throughout New Brunswick including their head office in Moncton.  He retired in 1978.
\par 
\par Dad was one of the promoters of farmers working together and was Secretary Treasurer of the Agricultural Society #103.  Part of the role was to maintain a "store" from which seeds, etc. would be sold.  After Dad died, Walter took over the role and moved the shed from the Branch to his place.
\par 
\par Walter and Agnes always welcomed visitors - family and friends alike - and they were good hosts.  A meal seemed to appear effortlessly and Walter encouraged visitors to "eat up and give the house a good name."  He liked to travel and visit family and friends in Bathurst, Rexton, Harvey Station and down to the Boston area.   He also traveled widely stopping to see men he had worked with.   For a while they owned a cottage Florina Beach near Cocagne, NB.  
\par 
\par Walter is also remembered for his keen memory.  He seemed to remember anyone he ever worked with, perhaps even met, and would visit if he was passing nearby.  He enjoyed reminiscing but talked little about what himself.  
\par 
\par Walter loved to visit the old home, "The Branch."  A few years ago, when he was not able to drive, I arranged to pick him up for a day's outing.  When we got into the car I said, "We can go any where you would like.  Would you like to go to the Island?  Saint John? Fredericton? Springhill? Or where?"  He hesitated only for a moment then said, "I think that I'd like to go to the Branch".  .

 Agnes was born in Black River and attended the Middle Black River (Cameron) school and was a member of St. Paul's Presbyterian Church; like so many young women, Agnes went to Boston to work (She had relatives there) but came home most summers.  I remember one year of Agnes coming to our place driving her brother's (?) car.  Cannot remember the make but it would be a 1930-something with extra wheels mounted on each front fender complete with silver spokes and whitewall tires.
\par 
\par In the late 1950's, Walters work transferred him to Moncton.  Shortly thereafter, Agnes enrolled in the RNA program at the New Brunswick Institute of Technology; she worked at the Moncton Hospital retiring in 1976.  Agnes also had an eye for antiques.

 Venetia was born at Little Branch.  Mum and Dad were living in Little Branch at the time.  Venetia attended the Little Branch School for Grades 1-8, the highest grade available in the Little Branch School, and then she 
\par stayed with Aunt Tine in Loggieville where she completed Grade nine.  Following that, she wrote Entrance Exams and gained First Class Entrance to the Provincial Normal School from which she graduated in 1933.  As I recall, Venetia taught in New Carlysle, Napan, Penniac and Bayside; she may also have taught somewhere north of Fredericton.  She also taught in Point Aux Carr, Little Branch, Miramichi Rural High School and Chatham retiring in 1975.  Quite a number of people at her wake mentioned that Venetia had been their teacher.
\par 
\par Venetia was active in her church, St. Paul's Presbyterian.  She probably attended Sunday school at St. Stephen's Presbyterian Church prior to it becoming St. Stephen's United Church.  When St. Paul's opened in 1930, there was a PYPS rally prior to the church opening. And Venetia was President of the Young Peoples Society.  The local paper, presumably the Chatham Gazette, noted, "Miss Venetia Glendenning, President Black River Y.P.S, in a very pleasing manner welcomed the delegates" Venetia was a member of St. Paul's since its establishment, played the organ for many years and for 40 years was Church Treasurer.  She was also a member of the Women's Missionary Society and the Women's League.
\par 
\par Venetia met Cameron Russell (1906-1979) in the spring of 1932 at Little Branch.  Cam was rafting logs for Harrison Murdoch and they tied up at the wharf.  Cam and perhaps other members of the crew came over to talk to the girls in the schoolyard.  They married in St. Paul's Presbyterian Church and lived in Point Aux Carr in a home they bought from Mrs. Simon MacDonald.  Mrs. MacDonald retained a room which she used mainly in the summer.  Cam and Venetia had three children, Glenn, Leonard and Donna.
\par 
\par Venetia was an avid reader, a good listener and a good sport.  She was a good conversationalist but not one to gossip or be critical of others.  She demanded nothing, asked little and offered much.  She did not complain and was always "fine" when asked about her own health.  She did not want to bother people.  She could entertain herself and did not mind living alone.  In fact, she lived alone for 20 years after she became a widow.
\par 
\par Venetia was a resource for information about her community and we shared an interest in genealogy; she provided me with much of my initial information about the Watling side of the family.  She could recall family relationships from memory whereas I have to rely on my notes and records.
\par 
\par Venetia and Cam had many trips to Florida with Ken and Verne.  When lighting her stove to warm the house on return from one trip in 1989 or 1990, the house caught fire and burned.  She rebuilt on the same site.  Venetia and Cam visited Donna and Vernon when they lived in Vancouver and later in England and, while in England, traveled with the family by car around Europe.  
\par 
\par As a youngster, I recall the nice table Venetia set at mealtime.  A visit to Venetia's always ended in lunch before leaving.  Sometimes when visiting the Miramichi in recent years, I would drop in on Venetia's about 8:00 am and enjoy toast, jam, tea and conversation.  She kept scotch cookies in her freezer and always set some out when she knew I was coming for a visit.
\par 
\par 
\par Venetia boarded with Archie MacKay in Fredericton while attending Normal School.
\par The web site of Adams Funeral Home of January 16, 2003 included the following:
\par "Mrs Venetia K. Russell
\par Miramichi - Mrs. Venetia Kathrine Russell, widow of the late Cameron Russell, of the Miramichi Senior Citizens Home, and formerly of Point Aux Carr, passed away at the Miramichi Regional Hospital, on Saturday morning, January 11, 2003 at the age of 87.

Cam was born and lived all his life in Point Aux Carr.  He was a fisherman - smelts in the winter and salmon in the summer.  At one time he fished just off-shore from where he lived but the fishing by set nets was banned and he "drifted" for salmon.  He also farmed.  When courting Venetia, he would often bicycle to Little Branch only to be asked to a barber to the Glendenning boys.

\par In school, students required a slate cloth and water to main clean slates.  Once Lillian dropped her slate cloth and instead of picking it up, tied the ankle of the student in front of her to the leg of the desk.  When the teacher called the girl to come to the board, the slate cloth tripped her.
\par 
\par Dad was returning from Moncton; Lillian was with him and maybe others.  Near Rexton, a car tried to run him off the road.  Lillian thought that they were rumrunners but perhaps the rum was inside them rather than just in the car.  Dad pulled in to a store/gas station and phoned the RCMP.  A police car came from Newcastle.  Lillian remembered riding in the police car as far as John W. MacNaughton's.
\par 
\par Lillian was a close friend of Maxine Macdonald and they used to visit back and forth.  One of Mum's tricks was to ask Lillian to take a note over to Maxine's mother.  She dutifully carried the noted a half-mile to Maxine's place.  She did not know it at the time, but the note simply said "Please send Lillian home after a while."
\par 
\par 
\par At age 16, Lillian was glad to go to Boston to work.  Ken remembers the phone call from her sister, Grace, who was living on Beacon Street at the time, saying that there was a job for her in Boston; Walter took Mum, Venetia and Lillian to catch the train at Newcastle.  She arrived in Boston on September 22, 1933 and, I think, stayed with Dad's cousin, Sam Knowles, for a while.  That night, she went to a dance with Grace and Roy to celebrate Grace's 22nd birthday. (Dates don't quite match)
\par 
\par While in Boston, Lillian did housework and looked after children first for Mrs. Fineberg, who was a singer, and later for Mrs. Piser.  Her last employer was Mrs. Walker where she worked for 5-6 years.  One of her addresses was "61 Mayo Avenue, Needham."
\par 
\par Brydone and Lillian met on April 18, 1933 while Lillian was visiting with Aunt Tine in Loggieville.  There was a service in the United Church and afterward the young people played badminton.  Brydone walked Lillian back to Aunt Tine's.  They courted for over 6 years.  Lillian came home most summers but Brydone also visited her in Boston.  In 1936, Brydone and Walter traveled to Boston by train stopping to visit in Portland on the way.  Brydone and his mother drove Lillian back to Boston in 1936 after Grace's wedding.
\par 
\par I can remember Brydone coming to court Lillian in his Dad's car (a 1935 Ford perhaps); I would hang around the front door and as they got into the car.  Occasionally, Brydone would invite me to get in and go for a ride.  Sometimes the ride would include a trip to the "Bayshore" and end with a cone of ice cream.
\par 
\par Lillian and Kenneth Brydone Weeks (July 6, 1917 - Sept 16, 1994) were married at Little Branch on December 22, 1939. by Rev. P. McK. Sampson, Minister of the Sunny Corner Presbyterian Church and they lived in Loggieville.  Shortly after, Brydone enlisted in the North Shore Regiment.  Lillian lived for a while in Woodstock, and Sussex as well as Camp Borden.  She and the family lived in Loggieville (13 Church Lane?) while Brydone was overseas.  .
\par 
\par Lillian was a people person.  She was active in her church.  She enjoyed company, was a great conversationalist and enjoyed both hearing and telling jokes.  Although she did not play any musical instrument she often sang while working around the house.  She also sang in the choir and I can still hear her singing The Old Rugged Cross.  Lillian, Brydone and daughter, Patricia, frequently led special church services with readings and song.
\par Lillian was a note-maker.  She maintained a record of dates of events from her community and from Black River.  In 1974-75, Lillian typed 144 pages of memories of her early years.  In 1995, I arranged for them to be printed and she gave copies to family and a few close friends.  Among other things, Lillian remembered visiting Bird Hill to observe the "Zepplin", a German dirigible pass on its way to New York.  That is the dirigible famous for having burst into flames while moored in New Jersey.
\par 
\par 
\par Lillian went to Boston on on September 22, 1933 and returned to NB to live in September, 1939.
\par The Fredericton gleaner carried the following on October 25, 2000:

Brydone was born in Loggieville and graduated from the Loggieville High School.  For a number of years he worked for A&R Loggie Company delivering groceries and feed with one of his regular routes being Loggieville to Escuminac.  People would phone in their orders and Brydone would deliver.  Once or twice he took me with him and bought lunch while in Escuminac.  It was quite a treat.
\par 
\par Brydone always wanted to farm and after leaving the army purchased a dairy farm near Harvey Station.  Brydone was always active in his church and, in late 1964; Brydone accepted a call to minister in a three-point Presbyterian charge with a manse provided in Stanley; Lillian and Brydone lived there until their retirement.
\par 
\par After Brydone retired, Lillian usually accompanied him when he substituted throughout Southern New Brunswick for ministers who were ill or on vacation.  After Brydone died, Lillian moved to Harvey Station, then with Ken and Beverley but eventually moved into a senior's home in MacAdam.
\par 
\par Their homes in Harvey Station and in Stanley were favourite stopping places when traveling through to Boston - as well as just for family visits.  I frequently stayed there.  In fact, at Easter of 1955, I was visiting when Mum phoned one night to say a letter had arrived saying that I had won a Beaverbrook Overseas Scholarship.

John was born at Little Branch shortly after the family returned to Canada.  He attended the Little Branch School probably for 7 or 8 years, and then he worked on the farm.  Dad had not been well for a number of years so Walter and John did the farm work.   
\par 
\par John and Walter hauled fish from Hardwicke to Chatham, cut hardwood on the "ridge" and delivered it to Loggieville and Chatham.  One day they would go to Hardwicke or Baie St. Anne (including Fred Savoie's) and bring fish back to the Branch; the next day, they delivered the fish to Chatham for $5.00 per ton (two box-sled loads).  They went to the woods and cut and split a cord of hardwood and the next day delivered it to Loggieville or Chatham for $5.00 including the cost of the wood.   
\par 
\par John worked hard and put in long hours.  He expected others to do their bit whether it was bringing in the wood for the stove, doing barn chores, going to the woods in winter, making hay in summer, etc.  It was expected and you did it.  But he was also very generous to people needing help.    
\par 
\par In the late 1930's John, along with some other young men from Black River including Tom Harper, Theodore Fowlie, took an agricultural course in Newcastle.  The course included practical farm mechanics, agriculture, book keeping, general mechanics and woodworking.  As part of the course, John made a beautiful birch desk, which he finished in walnut.  I also remember that he learned a new technique for killing chickens.  I believe that it was then or shortly thereafter, that John rigged up a wind generator on the roof of the barn which would charge a battery and provide light.
\par 
\par One winter, November I believe, he and Brydone Weeks (Brydone was home on leave, probably before he went overseas) built a tractor out of an Oakland front end (a car that belonged to Alex MacDonald) and a Godferson rear end (a truck used by the A&R Loggie Co) - and they did this in Walter's old shed without the aid of welding and cutting equipment (or heat). The tractor had two transmissions.  The tractor was very powerful but the too heavy for soft ground.
\par 
\par During the winter of 1945-46, and perhaps winters previous to this, John, Ken and Norm all worked in the woods for Hubert Matchett of Sunny Corner.  They would be gone all week and I did the barn work.
\par 
\par As a young lad going on 17, I went to work on the boats in Chatham loading pulp and pit props.  (I am sure that I got my first job based on the reputation of John, Ken and Norm.)  One day we were storing 8-foot props down in the hold.  They are heavy enough anyway but these were also moldy; I was struggling and John knew it.  John said, "Let me take that one, Donald".  And it happened many times.  
\par 
\par For a number of years John went from farm to farm along the Miramichi pressing hay, first with a horse powered hay press but later with a press operated off a tractor.  (When pressing hay at home, it was my job to keep the horse moving and to prevent it from grabbing at the hay when it went past the end of the bundle.)  Bundles of hay weighed between 80 to 120 pounds.  John worked all around Black River, Napan, Barnaby River, Cains River, etc.  For a number of years, John owned a 3-ton Dodge truck, which I believe he bought from Hubert Matchett, and trucked pulp, pit props, gravel, lime, fertilizer, hay and Christmas trees.
\par 
\par 
\par In 1946-47 John and Mary built a new house on the Bob MacLean property and in the spring of 1948 opened a store in their living room.  In 1968 they built a new store nearer the road and put in gas tanks.  John was very entrepreneurial selling groceries, flour, feed, plumbing, furnaces and anything else to make a buck.
\par 
\par John received his call for military service and, I believe, went to Fredericton for a physical.  He had very poor eyesight and was turned down.  He probably would not have had to serve anyway, because farming was an essential service and he was needed at home.  Ken and Norm were already in the Service and I was too young to take over the responsibility of farming.  
\par 
\par When Ken and Norm were in the service, I was the only one around to help with the farm work.  Since Dad died when I was very young, you might say that I learned to work under John's direction.  I recall going to the woods in the winter, sitting on the bob-sled and on the load of wood on the way home, building loads of loose hay and poisoning potato bugs early in the morning to take advantage of heavy dew.  John was the only one of the boys who would sing while driving to and from the fields or woods - I especially remember him singing familiar hymns.
\par 
\par Many of the older people in Black River will remember the 1939 Ford half-ton truck that, as I recall, John purchased from Bonnie Flanagan.  It was a far cry from the old Model A.  The truck had wooden cab on the back and John would take people to town on Saturday night when the stores were open.  There could be a 10-12 people in the back.  I think that he charged one dollar.  The last thing before leaving town, he would drive up Water Street and past Ben's Canteen to see if anyone needed a lift home.  
\par 
\par John and Mary liked to visit family and friends around the Miramichi and Bathurst.  John and Mary, with Margaret and Jeannie, made their first trip to Florida over Christmas of 1958.  Carol and I went with them to help with the driving.  Later, they managed to visit Florida for a month most winters always stopping to see family and friend in Florida and on the way.  When our children were small and we visited Black River, John always had gave the kids a candy or some change just as we were about to drive away.
\par 
\par I did not find an obituary, however, The Moncton Times of  Monday, June 23, 1986 carried the following: 
\par  "Black River Bridge couple beaten
\par Man dead, wife hurt in robbery
\par BLACK RIVER BRIDGE (Special)  An elderly  Black River Bridge man is dead and his wife is in serious but stable condition following what police suspect was a robbery attempt at the couple's home late Saturday.  John F. Glendenning, a local grocer, was pronounced dead on arrival at hospital, while his wife, Mary, remains in stable condition  at Chatham's Hotelo Dieu Hospital.
\par Both are believed to have been victims of a beating by "several" persons.
\par Police are saying little about the attack, but confirm several persons were questioned late Sunday before  being released. Robbery is presumed to be the motive for the attack at this point of the investigation.
\par Mary Glendenning, 62, was apparently tied up by her assailants but managed to free herself to  telephone for help.  No one else was in the house at the time.
\par The attack occurred sometime between 10 pm.and midnight Saturday.  The Glendenning's store adjacent to the house wasn't broken into, according to one family member. 
\par Newcastle RCMP are being assisted by General Investigation Section officers from Moncton, RCMP subdivision.  Black River Bridge is about 10 miles from Chatham.
\par Born in Black River Bridge, Glendenning was the son of the late Elmer and Jane E. (Watling) Glendenning  He was a grocer and farmer, a member of St. Paul's Presbyterian Church, Black River and an active member of the Black River Community Hall.
\par Besides his wife, the former Mary E. Watling of Point au Carr, he is survived by two daughters, Mrs. Aubrey Gibson (Margaret) of Black River Bridge, Mrs Ray Williston, (Jeannie)  of Moncton; three sisters, Mrs Roy Smith (Grace) of Boston, Mass., Mrs Brydone Weeks (Lillian) of Harvey Station, Mrs Cameron Russell, (Venetia) of Point au Carr; four brothers, Walter of Moncton, Kenneth of Centre Napan, Norman of Black River Bridge, Dr. Donald of Charlottetown, P.E.I.; four grndchildren; several nieces and nephews.
\par The body will be at Adams Funeral Home, Chatham after 7 p.m. Tuesday.  Funeral service will be at St. Paul's Presbyterian Church at a day and time to be announced. Burial will be in Black River Cemetery".}

Elinor, her Dad called her Nen, was born after the family returned to Canada; she attended the Little Branch School to the end of Grade 8.  She then wrote High School Entrance exams and attended high school classes in Bay du Vin.  
\par She usually walked to Bay du Vin, a distance of 5 miles, but sometimes rode her bicycle.  In the winter she boarded at Barbour Williston's.  On a beautiful sunny day in early September, 1935, I walked with Elinor to my first day at school.  She wrote and passed her Junior Matriculation. 
\par 
\par By 1933, Grace, Venetia and Lillian had left home and Elinor would have been the only daughter at home to help Mum. With Dad and five boys at home, while still going to school, and without electricity or running water, the work would have been heavy, indeed.
\par 
\par Elinor met Earl   when he worked and stayed at home.  They lived at the Branch until, I think, Earl went in the army then they bought a house on Harriman Lane in Loggieville.  As best I can remember, Elinor stayed in Loggieville all the time Earl was in the service.
\par 
\par In the summer of 1949, Elinor and Earl and family moved to Black River.  Alex MacDonald had been killed in an accident and W. S. Loggie Company held the mortgage on his property.  Elinor turned over their house in Loggieville to Loggie's and paid the difference - $300.  I moved their belongings from Loggieville to Black River in the 1949 red Chev  ton truck.  On one trip, we stopped to see Norm who was cutting grain in the field below John's house.
\par 
\par As her family got older, Elinor did housework for a number of people in Chatham and at CFB Chatham.  She also worked at the Miramichi Seniors' Home in Chatham and at the Rehabilitation Centre.  Elinor was active in St. Paul's Presbyterian Church being a member of both the Women's League and the Presbyterian Missionary Society, a member of the Women's Institute and an active Member of the Black River Community Hall Committee.  The hall had burned and a new building was constructed.  (This was the second time that the Black River Hall had burned.).  She phoned me to tell me about the fire; a few days later she went into the hospital and died after a brief illness.
\par 
\par Once when having supper after a day digging potatoes, we were sitting at the dining room table.  Uncle Jim was there because it was the custom for neighbours to exchange labour while cutting wood, threshing, picking potatoes etc.  It was dark so there was an oil lamp on the table.  Elinor went to reach across for butter and poked her knife through the lamp globe.  Of course, the flame went out as a result of the air rushing in.
\par 
\par Elinor wrote regularly when I was in England and her letters were always newsy.  At Christmas of 1955 - my first Christmas away from home, I recall coming back to the residence late on Christmas day to find a letter waiting for me from Elinor.  (Only in England would mail be delivered on Christmas day.)  She also wrote a letter every day to her son, Robert, when he lived in Toronto.
\par Elinor was a "high-energy" person - some may say it was a nervous energy.  She was a good worker, had a quick turn of mind, was fiercely loyal, and quick to support or defend family members.  She also had a temper.  Once when she was young, Mum sent the youngsters upstairs to make their Valentines.  (Ken says that Jamie Mortimer and Ward Godfrey were at home at the time).  Elinor and Norm had a spat and Norm tried to take the scissors from her and cut his hand.  Elinor enjoyed hockey and was a fan of the Montreal Canadiens.  She was a good letter writer and wrote to her son, Robert, every day but two during the years he lived in Toronto.  I forget the reason for the first day she did not write but the second was the day she was admitted to the hospital just before she died. The following tribute was written by Mrs. Donald Angus MacDonald.
\par 
\par To Elinor
\par Today I stood beside your silent bier,
\par Sweet fragrant flowers, tokens of esteem
\par Brought me thoughts of other days,
\par I see again your ready smile and kindly ways.
\par 
\par I feel your hand upon my arm
\par To aid me down the steps.
\par And see your keen and friendly interest
\par In every one you met.
\par 
\par You gave yourself to every worthy cause.
\par Your untiring energy you could not stay,
\par Our whole community is a richer place
\par Since you have passed this way.
\par 
\par The Master called you to a higher post
\par But this is not the end,
\par We'll meet again, and you will know
\par How proud I am, that I have called you friend.
\par                    C. A. MacDonald, February 24, 1973

Earl grew up in Napan and attended the Napan school.  As a young man, he worked around Napan and later did general farm work for Elmer Glendenning including haying, barn work and cutting wood in the winter.  He joined the army in 194? And, as I recall, was stationed in Fredericton, New Brunswick. Earl was discharged from the army on February 15, 1946 and worked at the Chatham air base.  .  
\par Fowlie's Mill
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par Earl had purchased a beautiful cream, chrome and red bicycle - double bars, handle bars and all.  It was a far cry from the old bicycle which Walter had as a kid and which we, and half Black River, learned to ride on. Sometimes Earl would take me on the parcel carrier; sometimes he even let me take it by myself.  One evening, just at dusk, he took me across to the field just behind Uncle Jim's shed where Uncle Jim was burning piles of brush

One year he stayed with Venetia and Cam in Point Aux Carr, went to school, and did the chores while Cam fished smelts.  After High school, Ken took a business course in Newcastle
\par 
\par In 1943, Ken enlisted in the RCAF; he phoned Mum from Moncton and, as I recall, Walter, Mum and I saw him at the Newcastle station when the train stopped briefly.  His first posting was to Toronto for basic training then to Galt for technical training as an airframe mechanic; later postings included St. John's, Quebec and Scoudouc, New Brunswick.  He brought an airman from BC home for Christmas that first Christmas.  After demobilization, he worked on the Miramichi including winters in the woods for Hubert Matchett and summers loading pulp and pit props on the boats. 
\par 
\par In 1948 he took a carpentry course in Moncton and, after doing carpentry work for a while, in 1950 he re-enlisted in the RCAF and his postings included Trenton, Calgary, Armstrong, Resolute, Moncton, Scoudouc, Greenwood, Ottawa and Chatham.  He retired from the air force 1984 after having a stroke.
\par 
\par In October 1939, Ken and I both came down with scarlet fever a week apart.  I think the quarantine period was 6 weeks - a red warning sign was posted by the front door. We shared the bedroom on the ground floor.  Then Ken came down with complications and I was moved to the small bedroom upstairs.  That was the time that "Old Jess", our faithful old horse, was put down.
\par 
\par Ken did all the usual farm work including collecting sap from which Mum made maple syrup.  I recall going with Ken with a horse and sled, with cream cans and the barrel from the churn, to collect sap before we went to school in the morning.
\par 
\par Ken has stories to tell about Venetia catching him when he tumbled out of the car on a turn in the Bathurst Road, getting pecked near an eye by a hen, and Wallace MacDonald's visit to the Little Branch School.  
\par 
\par While in the service, Ken worked as a carpenter in the evening and on Saturdays wherever he was posted; he built his own home in Napan, Venetia's home after her fire and a home for his in-laws after their fire.  He pitched in to help others building homes, barns, sheds, etc.
\par 
\par 
\par Ken has a great memory and likes to recount jokes and stories of yesteryear.  I often check with him on items about family tree information.  He attends in local political meetings.  At age 80 he purchased a computer and has learned the intricacies of email, games, and the internet and later he registered on Facebook.  Ken and Verne are regular participants in the seniors' card games at the Black River Hall and impromptu games either at their home or the home of friends.  When in the service, he was an active curler.

Norm was born on New Year's Eve, 1925, however, when the birth was registered; it was given as December 31, 1926.  Grandmother Glendenning was a Peters hence his second name.   According to Lillian, Mum and Dad had difficulty deciding between the names Norman and Robert. 
\par 
\par Norman attended the Little Branch School, classes in the Anglican Church in Bay du Vin and the Miramichi Rural High School.  Before school bus service was established, Norm used to take a horse to Bay du Vin, and later Bayside, picking up other students along the way.  The horse was stabled for the day in either Goymer Williston's or Harrison Smith's barn.  
\par 
\par At age 18, he enlisted in the army and found himself in the RCEME being sent first to Camp Utopia outside Saint John, New Brunswick and later to Woodstock, Ontario and Longueil, Quebec.
\par 
\par Norm was a good skater and a good dancer, and usually took me along when I first started going to dances in 1946. I also remember working with Norm at the hay; in the woods on cold and snowy Saturdays; butchering and peddling meat; shearing and dipping sheep and whatever else needed to be done.  
\par 
\par Among Norm's stories is one about Wallace MacDonald throwing a peavey at him and Edwin Adams, trips on icy roads up river with Mr. Harper to tend to a sick horse and the first time he drove a vehicle with airbrakes.
\par 
\par Norman married Jean Watling from Point Aux Carr.  Alton and Eric now operate the farm although Norm continues to "supervise" and run errands; most every day he makes a trip to Miramichi City.  Branchview, the Glendenning farm, is the largest farm east of Miramichi and one of the largest in the Miramichi area.  Branchview has been the recipient of a number of awards.  
\par 
\par Norman and Jean always welcome family to the old family home providing a place at the table for children, siblings, grandchildren, nephews and nieces alike.  He always tells visiting children where the kittens were and offers to give them one to take home.  Many young people of the community earned some money and learned important work habits while working on the farm with Norman and the "boys".  
\par 
\par Norm's early years were filled with long evenings of farm chores on top of full days driving truck for Alfred MacDonald or with John pressing hay.   
\par 
\par   For a number of years Norman served as a trustee of the Black River Community Hall including during a major renovation in the 1960's and reconstruction in the 1970''s; was a director of Agricultural Society #103 and was a Director of the Northumberland Cooperative Dairy.  He participates in local political meetings.  Although not one to travel, in "retirement" he takes time to visit neighbours and friends around Black River.

Don was born at Little Branch on September 8, 1929 and was baptized in the new St. Paul's Presbyterian Church in Black River on opening day, July 20, 1930.  Like the rest of the family, he attended the Little Branch School; he also graduated from the Miramichi Rural High School.
\par 
\par He completed a six-month teacher training program at Teachers' College in Fredericton in June 1947 and his first teaching position was at Middle Kouchibouguac.  Over the next few years he mixed teaching and study completing a PhD at Indiana University in 1964.  He also taught at the Miramichi Rural High School and the New Brunswick Institute of Technology. In 1969, after a number of years with the Federal Government, he moved to Prince Edward Island to become the first President of Holland College.  He also was active in a number of national professional organizations.  
\par 
\par After retiring from Holland College in 1987, he set up his own company and engaged in educational consulting in Canada and abroad.  His overseas contracts provided many travel opportunities especially to Asia and Africa.
\par 
\par He was bitten early by the travel bug and, either for business or pleasure, visited most every corner of Canada, most US states, and 40 countries in all. As a family, they lived in Moncton, Bloomington (Indiana), Ottawa, Vancouver and now in Charlottetown.  Don and Carol continue to travel and usually spend some time each winter in the southern USA. 
\par 
\par After retirement, Don resumed his interest in genealogy and visited Callister Hall, Scotland, where his great grandfather was born in 1807.  He publishes a Family Chronicle, an informal and occasional newsletter, which, thanks to Brian, is posted on the family website.  The Newsletter carries both family and personal recollections of growing up in Black River.
\par 
\par Retirement activities include genealogy, reading, volunteer work, travel, gardening, writing, letters to the editor - and working on his "farm".  Don was awarded the Order of Canada in 1986.
\par 
\par Childhood memories include picking wild blueberries, mayflowers, cherries, plums, strawberries, cranberries and mushrooms; hours spent with George Watling playing in and along the brook; our water diversion projects during spring run-off; the family going to church by horse and wagon; Sunday school under the huge tree in Uncle Jim's back yard; dances in the Black River hall, at Mel Adams hall and elsewhere; Saturday nights cruising the streets in Chatham, and many more.

Judith Gaines of the Boston globe wrote the following:
\par 
\par "A funeral Mass will be said today for Lawrence Albert Smith, 55, a gregarious and hard=working concessioner known to his customers as "The Great one."  He died on June 24 in his Somerville home of heart failure.
\par According to his wife, Sue (Rattie) smith, Mr. smith began selling popcorn and soda pop in the stands in Boston at age 16, after he was caught by security guards sneaking into a hockey game.
\par "What are you doing here." the security guard asked.
\par "Looking for the employment office," said Mr. Smith who was always quick with a comeback.  Personnel agents subsequently hired him as a vendor.
\par He later warned  friends "Don't ever sneak into a hockey game because they'll give you a job and you'll be there for life."
\par After working as a vendor in the stands, he sold souvenirs and other novelties at a concession stand for 38 years at Boston Garden.  When it closed, he sold programs at the Fleet Centre.  He is the only concessionaire ever named to the Boston Garden Hall of Fame.
\par A big, muscular man who was about six-feet tall and weighed more than 300 pounds, "The Great One" had an expansive personality.  He was always ready to pitch in with whatever needed to be done, his wife said, and he liked telling jokes.
\par "His customers would bring him jokes, and he liked to have new ones to tell him every night." she said.  "he was really good with people."
\par In addition to his wife, he leaves a son, Mark, of Springfield; three daughters, Julie, Melissa and Stacy, all of Somerville; his sister, Barbara Coppla, of Malden; and a  granddaughter.
\par The funeral Mass will be said at 10:00 am at St. Ann's Church in Somerville.  Burial will be in Holy Cross Cemetery in Malden."}
