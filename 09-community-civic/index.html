Don analyzes multiple math providers (public schools, postsecondary institutions, SkillsPEI, private schools, independent learners) operating without coordination or shared definitions. He argues that transition from secondary to post-secondary education depends on mathematics preparation. The paper recommends adopting competency-based outcomes, implementing universal curriculum platforms, independent assessment bodies, and user-based advisory committees. Don&#x27;s analysis identifies fundamental problems: lack of agreed definitions, no coordination mechanism, inconsistent evaluation criteria, and fragmented delivery. The document reflects his systematic approach to identifying systemic barriers to educational quality.<div class="expanded-tags"><span class="badge badge-low">EDUCATION</span></div><div class="expanded-file"><a href="read/08-math-instruction-in-pei.html">Read</a> · <a href="files/08%20Math%20Instruction%20In%20PEI.docx">Download</a></div></div></td>

Don explains the organization&#x27;s governance by a non-partisan volunteer board and its mandate to support learning culture and ensure quality education for all Canadians. He details the strategy: independent information (monthly newsletter, website hub for surveys/announcements/papers); engagement (workshops across PEI starting January 20, 2014 with good attendance); and awards/incentives (addressing education sector gaps). Don outlines longer-term aspirations including community facilitators, expanded incentives, technology clips, student math clubs, professional teacher support, and creativity workshops. Seeking $22,000 short-term ($10,000 annually for three years), Don emphasizes innovation and requests the Windsor Foundation&#x27;s partnership.
