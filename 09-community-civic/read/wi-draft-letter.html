<p><br></p>
<p>Dear<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>In the course of our activities at CFPEI, we have become aware of a major concern among charitable organizations about their ability to recruit, develop and retain board members.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The issue is quite serious; it seems, especially in smaller communities Trustees for cemeteries are a case in point.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Recently, we have become aware of an initiative at other community foundations designed to encourage young people to get to know the needs of their communities and practice their volunteerism.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In effect, school based school groups are encouraged to explore the needs of their community, especially those related to youth, and are allocated $1,000 for which they may determine grants.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In addition, each participating school is challenged to establish an endowment fund in support of youth needs.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Our objective is to introduce the program in at least three schools during the coming year and, once enrolled,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>to maintain the program for at least three years.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>We are looking for sponsors for the program and wonder if Womens’ Institutes<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>would be interested in sponsoring a school for $2,500 or, if not, making a donation to the cause.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I am enclosing some information about the Foundation and about the Youth In Philanthropy project and, as well,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>a self addressed envelope should you be interested in giving support.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Should you need more information about the Foundation or the Youth in Philanthropy project, do not hesitate to contact me.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Should you be interested,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>we would be happy to arrange a meeting of provide a speaker.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>We look forward to hearing from you and hopefully to your financial support.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Thanks in advance for your consideration.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I was thinking of including our most recent newsletter and the YIP brochure – perhaps 5 copies one for each of their executive members.</p>
