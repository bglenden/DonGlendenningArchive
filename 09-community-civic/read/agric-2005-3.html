<p><b>COMMUNITY FOUNDATION OF PRINCE EDWARD ISLAND</b></p>

<p><b>Date:		Draft -<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>TIME \@ "MMMM d, yyyy" September 9, 2005</b></p>
<p>To:		Executive</p>
<p>From:		Don</p>
<p>Subject:	Farm Equipment Fund</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>From some time snow we have been talking with officials of the PEI Museum and Heritage Foundation about the recovery of early agricultural equipment, especially equipment manufactured on Prince Edward Island.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The initiative has a number of elements including:</p>
<p>The identification of artifacts</p>
<p>Retrieval</p>
<p>Restoration/refurbishment as appropriate</p>
<p>Display</p>
<p>Documentation, and</p>
<p>Demonstration</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The core group leading the initiative includes: Dr. Tom Hall, Jack Cutcliffe, JoAnn McQuaid, Henry Compton, Tom LeClair and Tony Glencross: I have been acting as chair.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Already some implements and machinery have been retrieved as a result of our involvement in the initiative.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>One of the stumbling blocks has been the availability of suitable storage for artifacts, especially larger pieces of equipment.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In fact, many pieces of farm equipment at Orwell are exposed to the weather. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Our committee has concluded that a building for storage and display is crucial to the initiative.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Two viable alternatives emerged.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>One alternative is to renovate an existing barn, known as the Stanley Barn, adjacent to the new museum building; another is to construct a new building for the same purpose.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In either case, buildings and equipment will be owned by the PEI Museum and Heritage Foundation. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>After a visit to the site and considerable discussion, Committee members favour the renovation of the existing building because:</p>
<p>It is located adjacent to the main museum building,</p>
<p>It is an authentic farm structure, and</p>
<p>The cost of construction and renovation is not out of line.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Funds will be required to ensure adequate dry storage space.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In addition, the committee is of the view that a long term benefit would result from an endowment to provide ongoing support for such related activities as equipment identification and retrieval, restoration, public information and research.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We anticipate a fund of $250,000 of which $100,000 will be for building restoration.</p>
<p>Research</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>CFPEI does not normally engage in fund raising activities, therefore, I recommend that CFPEI:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Offer general support for the initiative</p>
<p>Promote the initiative in our reports and documents</p>
<p>Promote the Farm Equipment Fund that CFPEI has already approved.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
