  2009-13 summer Islanders
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Written May 29, 2009, this document evaluates CFPEI&#x27;s Summer Islanders programming, including annual receptions for US citizens, summer lecture series, and social events. Don reviews the successes and challenges of each initiative, noting that the first and fourth receptions best achieved objectives with minimal resource drain and maximum opportunity for conversation. He proposes two alternatives: either hand July 4th celebrations to municipalities, or develop a formal &quot;Summer Islanders Society&quot; with membership fees to sustain operations and deepen visitors&#x27; engagement with the island community.</div>

<p>Subject:	The future of Summer Islanders</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Background:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>For a number of years now, we have been organizing activities for summer Islanders:</p>
<p>The purpose of the US reception is twofold: to recognize the contributions of summer islanders and to tell them about CFPEI.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The first US reception, I believe, was very successful and resulted in over 100 people enjoying a reception and entertainment at the Haviland Club.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Although I was not at the second reception, at the culinary institute, I understand that it was well attended and well received.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The third reception, also at the culinary Institute was overwhelmed by US tourists who, it seems were more attracted by the free food than by the chance to visit.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This year’s reception is by invitation only and returns to the Haviland Club.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We are designing it, hopefully, so that participants will have more opportunity to meet and visit</p>
<p>.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>We’ve now hosted two summer lecture series with a third planned for this year; the first two were at the Victoria Playhouse with the one this year being held at ???<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In addition, we organized two summer socials, the first at UPEI and quite well attended with the second being at HMSC Charlottetown and poorly attended.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>On several occasions, we’ve wondered out loud as to whether these activities were fulfilling their objectives and warrant our efforts.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Alternative ideas:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>That we hand the July 4 birthday celebration over to the various municipalities and suggest that it be public, with national anthems and birthday cake only</p>
<p>That we develop a “Summer Islanders Society” as an instrument to help Summer Islanders learn more about the Island, to meet and get to know other Islanders and to encourage them to contribute even more than they have in the past.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I am suggesting a fee which we would use to help with organization costs.</p>
