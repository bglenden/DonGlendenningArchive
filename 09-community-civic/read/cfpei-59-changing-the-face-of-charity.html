  CFPEI 59-Changing the face of charity
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">This January 2006 newsletter provides strategic analysis of community foundations&#x27; role in reshaping Canada&#x27;s charitable sector. Don features CFPEI President Norman Carruthers explaining how community foundations differ from traditional charities by addressing broad community needs across all sectors. He details CFPEI&#x27;s impact: a $100,000 Challenge Grant to 50 organizations for capacity building, scholarship programs, and emergency response initiatives. Don emphasizes donors&#x27; growing desire to customize donations and the foundation&#x27;s flexibility in responding to varied charitable interests (literacy, medical emergencies, scholarships, area-specific funds). The low one-percent administration fee is highlighted as enabling donor accessibility.</div>

<div id="Section1" dir="ltr"><p align="center">Reshaping
	the charitable sector</p>
	<p align="justify" style="font-weight: normal"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify"><span style="font-weight: normal">Community
	foundations have reshaped the charitable sector across Canada and
	the effects are being felt in Prince Edward Island.  So says Norman
	Carruthers, President of the Community Foundation of Prince Edward
	Island.</span></p>
	<p align="justify" style="font-weight: normal"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify"><span style="font-weight: normal">Most
	charitable organizations are focused on the needs of a particular
	segment of the community such as health, the local hospital, or the
	local arts organization.  Community foundations, on the other hand,
	have a broad interest in all of the needs of all of the communities
	across the Island whether those needs be in the field of health,
	education, religion, environment, heritage, arts or any other
	sector.  In accomplishing their mandate, community foundations
	support charitable organizations that work in any and all sectors.  </span>
	</p>
	<p align="justify" style="font-weight: normal"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify"><span style="font-weight: normal">To
	illustrate the point, under a recent “Challenge Grant”, the
	Foundation made grants totaling $100,000 to some 50 PEI charitable
	organizations in the area of capacity building.  In addition, the
	Foundation offered scholarships and conducted a number of workshops
	for the charitable sector.</span></p>
	<p align="justify" style="font-weight: normal"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify"><span style="font-weight: normal">Perhaps
	a greater impact, however, has come from the Foundations ability to
	respond to donors’ interests in customizing their donations. 
	Regardless of the charitable interest, community foundations can
	find ways to respond.  As examples, thanks to the generosity of
	donors, grants are now available to improve the first response
	efforts to medical emergencies, to purchase books for Island
	schools, to support literacy and to provide scholarships for PEI
	students who wish to study either on or off the Island.  The Souris
	Fund is another example of our flexibility in that it provides
	grants for any charitable purpose in the Souris area; the
	establishment of a Living Trust is another.</span></p>
	<p align="justify" style="font-weight: normal"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify"><span style="font-weight: normal">Increasingly,
	donors, especially younger donors, want to be involved in how their
	charitable donations will be spent; this is consistent with a
	community foundation’s style of operation.  While granting
	decisions must remain with the Foundation, the Foundation welcomes
	recommendations from donors as to charitable needs to be addressed. 
	  Donors also like the fact that the Foundation makes grants only to
	registered charities and funds can be redirected to similar causes
	if the original cause becomes no longer valid.</span></p>
	<p align="justify" style="font-weight: normal"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify"><span style="font-weight: normal">And
	donors are amazed that community foundations have such low
	administration fees.   The administration fee, used to maintain an
	office with a part-time office administrator, is one percent of the
	value of an endowment annually.  Add to this an investment
	administration fee of less than one percent, and we feel that we
	offer the best bargain in town.  Low administrative fees are
	possible because of the nature of the role we play in the charitable
	sector, responsibilities assumed by our volunteer Directors, the
	work of volunteers, our office is staffed on a part-time basis only,
	and the generous financial contributions by supporters including
	Directors</span></p>
