<div class="reader-summary">A February 17, 2014 letter to the Windsor Foundation (Scotiatrust, Halifax) describing Education 20/20 Inc.&#x27;s founding mission and three-pronged strategy. Don explains the organization&#x27;s governance by a non-partisan volunteer board and its mandate to support learning culture and ensure quality education for all Canadians. He details the strategy: independent information (monthly newsletter, website hub for surveys/announcements/papers); engagement (workshops across PEI starting January 20, 2014 with good attendance); and awards/incentives (addressing education sector gaps). Don outlines longer-term aspirations including community facilitators, expanded incentives, technology clips, student math clubs, professional teacher support, and creativity workshops. Seeking $22,000 short-term ($10,000 annually for three years), Don emphasizes innovation and requests the Windsor Foundation&#x27;s partnership. The Community Foundation administers funds.</div>

<p>Dear Sir:</p>
<p>	</p>
<p>Over the past few months, I’ve been working with a small group of Islanders who believe that education is important, that it needs some changes and that the key to change is an informed and engaged public.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We are also of the view that the school system is unlikely to make the necessary changes by itself; so, we’ve established an independent group, Education 20/20 Inc. (Mission statement attached).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Our initial strategy is three pronged, independent information, engagement and incentives, with the objective of encouraging changes that will improve the quality of education for all.<span class="Apple-converted-space">     </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li5"><b>Independent information:</b><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Most of our information about education comes from the people who operate the school system and is about schools and schooling; to address the shortage and lack of independence, Education 20/20 Inc. produces a monthly electronic newsletter; in addition, our website has just gone live and we plan to use it as an information hub for surveys, announcements, occasional papers, social media, etc.<b><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>(www.education2020.ca)<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></li>
</ul>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li5"><b>Engagement</b>:<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Having information is one thing but understanding, internalizing and using it is another.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As a first step, we’ve launched a series of workshops across PEI, the first was held on January 20 in the Stratford Town Hall, was well attended.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A repeat is scheduled for Montague on February 18 and dates have been set for others. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Our thinking is to encourage discussions on educational issues of all kinds in many Island communities.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>(As one participant pointed out, the very fact that an independent organization convened such a meeting is a breakthrough)<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li5"><b>Awards and incentives</b>: The education sector lack incentives – students cannot finish early; there is little encouragement to innovate, principals have little autonomy to make local adjustments; teachers are paid for what they know rather than what they do, each school is a cookie cutter of all other schools, and parents have little choice in choosing a school and none in choosing a teacher.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As an incentive to greater engagement, and thanks to a generous donor, Education 20/20 will soon announce an educational award for a school or learning centre that best demonstrates engagement in its everyday activities; we plan to expand our incentive program into other areas and beyond the borders of PEI.</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Our pressing need is for help in putting relevant information onto our website and into the public domain; our longer term horizon, however, includes facilitators to support engagement processes in local communities, an expanded incentives program, technology based micro clips on key education concepts,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>math clubs for students, professional support for teachers at all levels, creativity workshops, student competitions, promotion, and surveys,<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Our group cannot make this happen alone; funds are needed first to continue the initiatives mentioned above, but also to develop new ones.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Our current needs are modest, our short term goal for support of the above initiatives is $22,000 broken out as follows:</p>
<p><br></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li5">Gathering and disseminating information	$15,000.</li>
  <li class="li5">Promoting and awarding<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>incentives		$ <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>2,000</li>
  <li class="li5">Workshops					$ <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>2,500</li>
  <li class="li5">Operational support				$ <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>2,500</li>
</ul>
<p><span>Total <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>$22,000</span></p>
<p><span></span><br></p>
<p>Obviously, we well be grateful for any contribution, but are requesting $10,000<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>a year for the next three years to help kick-start the initiative.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The Community Foundation of Prince Edward Island supports our work and, in fact, administers our funds.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Contributions<b> </b>to Education 20/20 Inc., therefore, should be directed to the Foundation (Community Foundation of Prince Edward Island, 119 Queen Street, Charlottetown, PE C1A 4B3) who will issue charitable receipts.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I’m enclosing some background information about Education 20/20 Inc. and would be happy to provide additional information if needed; you may also want to browse our website.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Ensuring a quality education for every Canadian requires new thinking, new approaches and new partners.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We have hope that you will join us in making the change.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
<p><br></p>
