  YAC
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">This document provides detailed analysis of Youth Advisory Committee (YAC) models used by community foundations across Canada, particularly the Fundy Foundation. It describes how YACs operate—student self-selection, monthly meetings, philanthropic needs assessment, local charity visits, and grant recommendations. The document outlines funding requirements ($2,500 for granting, $500 for expenses, $1,000 for overhead) and proposes CFPEI establish at least one YAC by September 2011 with a three-year commitment. It includes specific proposals for volunteer liaison positions and donor sponsorship recruitment.</div>

<p><span><b>Youth in Philanthropy (YIP)</b><b></b></span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Many community foundations operate YIP programs.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>YIP’s are intended to provide opportunities for high school students to become involved in philanthropy and community development.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>One model involves students in a single school; another model involves students in a community who may not all be from the same school.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Each year in September, a Youth Advisory Committee is established.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Students self select and run the show; it may be simply a club that meets at noon hour or after school.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Each YAC has an adult advisor selected by the youth.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In the case of the Fundy Foundation, the Exec Director also attends the meeting but that does not seem to be a requirement.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The YAC meets to explore philanthropic needs in their local are, especially needs of youth.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>YACs discuss local needs, visit local charities, receive proposals/requests, conduct interviews, and present written recommendations to the grant-making committee of the community foundation.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Once established the community foundation allocates a sum of money, $2,500 seems most common, which is distributed to local charities as recommended by the YAC.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Each Youth Advisory Committee is also expected to undertake fundraising for a Youth Endowment Fund which is a permanent endowment with the Foundation.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Earnings from the Fund are added each year to the Foundation grant thereby adding to the money available each year for distribution.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Fundy Foundation YAC has about 10 members, they come from different schools so meetings rotate, usually meet in the evening, often the Foundation provides pizza or sandwiches.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The YAC has co-leaders.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>YAC members usually participate in the annual fund raising dinner.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Fundy Foundation says it is a popular activity and easy to find sponsors.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>School based YACs run for the school year; some members return a second or more years and others leave because of graduation or changing interests.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>So, each year the process the YAC is reconstituted by, in Fundy’s case, a letter from the Foundation to the school.</p>
<p>The Fredericton Community Foundation offers “youth in grades 9 to 12 the opportunity to have a voice in the issues, challenges, and opportunities facing youth in our community through their Youth Advisory Council (YAC).<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The YAC has a role in assessing the needs and concerns of youth in our community, participating in building a perpetual youth endowment fund, and recommending grants to important community projects that are initiated by, or intended for youth. With the support of an Adult Advisor for the Fredericton Community Foundation, youth leaders of the YAC are the key decision makers in everything from running their meetings to making grants to youth oriented projects”..</p>
<p>Funding is minimal.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Based on my findings, $2,500 for granting; $500 for local expenses (food, local visits, advertising).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>CFPEI would need something for overhead ($1,000?) Although each year of a YAC is a separate cycle, it seems to me that we should aim for at least a three year commitment either from our own funds or from a sponsor..<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><b>Proposal</b></p>
<p><b>That we commit ourselves to sponsoring at least one YAC starting in September 2011</b></p>
<p><b>That CFPEI seek a volunteer to be our liaison with the school and the YAC (separate from the YAC adult advisor)</b></p>
<p><b>That we approach one Island Senior high school with an offer to support a YAC.</b></p>
<p><b>That we seek a donor or donors willing to sponsor one or more YACs for a minimum period of 3-5 years.</b></p>
