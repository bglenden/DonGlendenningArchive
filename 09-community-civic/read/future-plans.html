<p><b>COMMUNITY FOUNDATION OF PRINCE EDWARD ISLAND</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Living Memorial Trusts</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>1. Background</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>Living memorials are green spaces set aside in memory of a person, place or event; the key characteristic is that it is a natural space and plant life continues to grow. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A living memorial may be as simple as a single tree or bush but also may be a garden, a park or a forest. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Living Memorials are more than just a tribute to loved ones; living memorials enhance and beautify our environment, provide shelter for our wildlife, reduce erosion and improve the quality of the air we breathe.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Living memorials may bring comfort, hope and peace to visitors and ensure that generations to come will know the beauty of a green plant. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>In addition to actual living plants and, depending on the nature of the space , a living memorial may also include comfortable benches on which to rest, a scenic view or viewing platform, path enhancement, footbridges, picnic areas, wildlife areas, handicap accessibility, and erection of shelters. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>2. Why a living memorial?</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>People usually donate to a Living Memorial to recognize or honour a person, organization or event at a time of a major life change including:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>a special birthday,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>a retirement,</p>
<p>the birth of a child,</p>
<p>the death of a family member, friend or colleague,</p>
<p>recognition of long and loyal service,</p>
<p>recognition of outstanding service</p>
<p>the relocation of a colleague or friend</p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>3. The CFPEI Living Memorial Trust</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Initial funding for The Living Memorial Trust at the Community Foundation of Prince Edward Island was provided by the family of Dr. Charles Keuper, a retired physician with a deep love for the natural beauty of his adopted home.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Dr. Keuper was an avid and tireless worker in the establishment of Trails PEI and a person who savoured outdoor life to the full.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Through the Living Memorial Trust, Dr. Keuper’s family honors his memory and encourages others with similar interests to do likewise.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The Living Memorial Trust is one of a number permanent endowments at The Community Foundation of Prince Edward Island, a non-profit organization managed by a volunteer Board of Directors, which oversees permanent endowments set up by members of the community.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The purpose of the Living Memorial Trust is to make grants to enhance outdoor public green spaces throughout Prince Edward Island.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Contributions to The Living Memorial Trust are welcomed to mark a milestone in the life of a person or organization and all donations will be recorded in a Memorial Register.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Individual interested in plantings in places of special significance should contact the Foundation.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Donors will be given a receipt to be used when filing Income Tax returns in Canada or the USA<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>4. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Inaugural Planting</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>On July 21, 2007, two clusters of three red oak trees were planted at the entrance to the Confederation Trail at Wood Islands in memory of Dr. Keuper.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The planting was made possible through the efforts of many people and organizations including the Keuper Family, Wood Island Development corporation, Department of Forestry, Department of Transportation and Public Works and the PEI Department of Tourism.</p>
