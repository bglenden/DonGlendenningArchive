<p><b>Re:<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>#??</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>I know that we have recently submitted our final report under the above noted agreement; however, I want to add a personal note to again express my thanks to you and to the Seacay Corporation.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The Match-Grant offer presented CFPEI with a significant challenge but also gave us a great boost.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In addition to the financial support, it moved us to seek out community leaders to explain the role of a community foundation and to make the case for support.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>During the past few months in particular, we have found a definite upsurge of interest in the Foundation; since the beginning of 2006 alone, a family has established a substantial health care endowment, we are partnering with a heritage group and a community leader has established a fund to provide perpetual care to a city park.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In addition, we are in active discussion with a number of organizations and expect to see substantial funds coming our way during the present year or the next.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>We are also in discussion with a potential partner to introduce a challenge grant program to some of our small communities.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Again, I thank you for your understanding and support.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Should other initiatives or opportunities come to your attention that you think would be of interest to us, we would be delighted to consider them.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Unfortunately, our paths did not cross during the term of our contract.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Should your travels bring you to PEI, we would be delighted to have you drop in for a visit.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Warmest personal regards</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Don Glendenning</p>
<p>Director</p>
