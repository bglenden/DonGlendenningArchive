  RBC lead second page
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">This document contains the final page of the Royal Bank lead donor proposal (see entry #17). It includes the budget breakdown, explanation of the Community Foundation of PEI&#x27;s administrative role, and the specific invitation for RBC to serve as lead supporter with a $10,000 commitment. The closing statement emphasizes that &quot;Ensuring a quality education for every Canadian requires new thinking, new approaches and new partners&quot; and appeals to RBC as a potential partner whose support would turn ideas into realities. This second page, preserved separately, likely served as a follow-up or emphasis document in Don&#x27;s fundraising process.</div>
