  Black, Draft letter
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Draft letter from Don to Professor Roger Black following a pre-Christmas breakfast, highlighting CFPEI&#x27;s 2008 achievements (60K+ grants, 160+ endowments nationally). Don discusses Black&#x27;s potential legacy related to his UPEI teaching career, visual arts collection, and faculty support, positioning CFPEI as the mechanism for a lasting contribution. Demonstrates Don&#x27;s personalized approach to philanthropic relationships and his ability to reflect donors&#x27; values.</div>

<p>Dear Roger:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I enjoyed our pre-Christmas breakfast and being updated on your most recent trip to Ottawa; I trust that you are none the worse for having overnighted in your car in Gagetown, New Brunswick.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Our discussions also included the work and progress of the Community Foundation of Prince Edward Island and it is about that topic that I write this letter.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I am sorry that you did not receive your invitation to our awards night on August 20, 2008.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I was out of Province at the time but am told that it was one of the best ever.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>During the reception we were able to report grants in excess of $60,000 made during the past year.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A list of awards and other Foundation activities is found in enclosed Community Reporter.<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>What isn’t so public is the increased operating support thanks to the generosity of Directors, volunteers and friends.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is too soon yet to know the impact of market conditions on our ability to make grants in 2009 but we are optimistic that our policy of granting based on a four year end-of-year Fair Market Value should reduce the 2008 impact somewhat.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>You know from our conversation, Roger, about my support of community foundations, and there are some 160 across Canada today.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Community foundations are unique in that they focus on endowments, granting in perpetuity, a broad range of community interests and the fact that they represent the interests of the donor.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>On PEI, we are the only public foundation; all others serve a very limited interest.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Among our grantees we list UPEI and Holland College students, hospitals, youth groups, health organizations, the planting of memorial trees, heritage, arts, etc.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We also administer funds for other charitable organizations and are currently in active discussion with a number of individuals and organizations who have or want to arrange long term financial support for causes of interest.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Having been involved in one way or another with the establishment of more than 40 endowments, I feel comfortable in saying that CFPEI is the most experienced organization on the Island when it comes to designing charitable funds and plans reflecting donor interests and community needs..</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>A couple of things less well known about CFPEI is the role we play as “conveners” meaning that we bring people or organizations together to explore common interests in improving our community; as an example I point to our role with the arts community resulting in the channeling of $800,000 into the arts over a 4 year period.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A second service is that of flow-through grants to other charities. For example, one US donor, who<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>wishes to remain anonymous,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>makes a gift to CFPEI along with instructions as to where grants are to be made.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Our normal services include:</p>
<p>Designing and establishing endowments. Investing and monitoring performance, and auditing and reporting on to both the public and the Canada Revenue Agency</p>
<p>Making grants that reflect a donor’s wishes and create value within the charitable sector; a donor’s wishes could be as simple as naming charities of interest to which grants are to be made</p>
<p>providing information and advice to individuals, organizations and other foundations on existing and potential community needs</p>
<p>accepting donations of any kind including cash, real estate, personal property, stocks, bonds and other financial instruments; this could include acting as Executor to an estate</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>When thinking of you and your legacy to Prince Edward Island, the following come quickly to mind:</p>
<p>Influence on the life of thousands of students at UPEI in their preparation for a career in education</p>
<p>Support for the visual arts and collection of paintings by both budding and established artists</p>
<p>Dedication to the interests and welfare of faculty both in Prince Edward island and throughout the country</p>
<p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Reputation as an astute and successful investor<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Decisions about one’s estate are both important and personal; increasingly people tell me that, after family have been taken care of, they want to give back to the community that supported them.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Many are opting to make that provision now rather than after death.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I, and we, at the Community Foundation of Prince Edward Island, have appreciated your interest and support in times past and would welcome an opportunity,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>preferably to assist you but if not then your Executor, in hosting an endowment to carry your legacy into the future.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>If you require additional information or would like to explore options and ideas, do not hesitate to contact me</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Warm personal regards</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Don Glendenning</p>
<p>Director</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>NOTE:	I have drafted the items below to put them on the<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>record.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My current thinking is not to include them in the above letter</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Your interests could be met in many ways including:</p>
<p>a permanent exhibition of your art work</p>
<p>scholarships that reflect your professional interests including subjects taught, practice teaching and practicing teachers</p>
<p>annual lecture series reflecting an area of interest</p>
<p>Leadership in education award</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Jeniene:<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Perhaps drop reference to doing it now and include a coup0le of ideas for the brother</p>
