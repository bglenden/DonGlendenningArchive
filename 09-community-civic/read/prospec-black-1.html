<p>Professor R. D. H. Black</p>
<p>42 Marjorie Crescent,</p>
<p>Stratford, PEI		C1A 7T9</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Dear<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>This note is a brief follow-up to a conversation over coffee about estate planning and charitable giving. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>You, Roger, were an early contributor and have been a long-time friend to the Community Foundation of Prince Edward Island (CFPEI) and, therefore, are familiar with our role and services.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You also know most if not all of the people involved with CFPEI since its inception; your brother may not be as familiar with community foundations generally or CFPEI and, given that he will be your Executor and the person to make decisions about your estate, this letter may also be of value to him.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>It is commonly accepted that community foundations combine three main roles:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b><span class="Apple-converted-space">     </span>1	<span class="Apple-converted-space">      </span>Endowment building and donor service</b>	</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Charitable gifts of many donors are pooled to create permanent, income-earning endowment funds – a nest egg that will always be there to benefit communities.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Community foundations connect donors with issues and organizations that matter most to them.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They offer a variety of funds to meet donors’ charitable goals and use their insight and experience to help donors have maximum impact.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Grantmaking</b> <span class="Apple-converted-space"> 	</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Income earned by invested funds is used to make grants to a wide range of community groups - and the original investment is left to grow.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>3	Community convening and leadership</b><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Community foundations work with the entire community, bringing people together from all sectors to identify and address local issues.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Endowments may be established for any charitable purpose; some endowments are undesignated and allow grants to be made for existing as well as emerging needs; other endowments are restricted todefined areas of interest.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Endowments may also allow for the donor to provide advice from time to time on the purposes for which grants are made..<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The Foundation provides local administration for a small fee – currently one percent of the value of the fund each year.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>As you know, community foundations are volunteer driven, have public annual meetings, include an annual external audit, publish an annual report, and use volunteers and community members wherever possible in carrying out their activities.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Since CFPEI makes decisions into the future in the name of the donor, it is important to understand the purpose for which a fund is established and the kind of decisions that a donor would make if making the decisions himself.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If arrangements are not made in advance, I urge you to discuss the matter with your brother and put notes on file to help him with the decision making. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>For your information, I am enclosing our last audit statement and annual report, our most recent Newsletter, and the most recent report of Community Foundations of Canada.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Should you want additional information or to discuss ideas or options, please do not hesitate to let me know. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Thank again for your continuing interest.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>Don Glendenning</p>
<p>Director</p>
