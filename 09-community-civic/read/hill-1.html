<div class="reader-summary">This June 7, 2012 letter to Jamie Hill, CEO of iWave Information Systems Inc., solicits $20,000 in funding for Education First Canada&#x27;s early initiatives. Don addresses Hill as someone who shares his belief in educational system transformation, noting that change requires external pressure. Education First Canada, supported by the Community Foundation of PEI, plans community conversations about quality education, media outreach, a network of educational innovators, and school engagement awards. Don emphasizes that his team consists of seasoned educators and that the Community Foundation will manage finances and charitable receipts. The letter demonstrates Don&#x27;s early fundraising efforts and his engagement of the technology sector business community in education reform.</div>

<p>Mr. Jamie Hill, CEO</p>

<p>Dear Mr. Hill:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>You know, I am sure, that I believe strongly in the need for change in our education system and am of the view that change will only happen with external insistence.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A new <span>group, <b>Education First Canada</b>, is now incorporated and ready to commence work.</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Our plans for the remainder of 2012 includes:</p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li6">A series of community conversations about what constitutes a quality education</li>
  <li class="li6">News items on education for the local media</li>
  <li class="li6">A network of innovators in education, and</li>
  <li class="li6">An award to a school for a public engagement initiative. <span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p>Although Education First is a new organization, our group consists of seasoned educators.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Furthermore, I am pleased to inform you that the Community Foundation of Prince Edward Island supports this initiative and will manage our funds, including the issuing of receipts. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>We are at a very early stage of development, however, the attached documents will help you understand who we are and what we believe.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Improving the quality of education is a complex matter and, doubly so, when trying to do so from the outside. I believe that it is important, therefore, for community leaders like yourself understand our plans and participate in the change process</p>
<p>The process of change is now under way but we need your help; $20,000 will see the above projects well-launched over the next few months.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A donation will not only support the project, but will also signal your support for change.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><span>Donations should be made payable to Community Foundation of Prince Edward Island – Education First Canada,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Suite 105, Queen Square Place, 119-121 Queen St., Charlottetown, PE<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I’ll contact you early next week to for a chance to discuss the initiative further.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
