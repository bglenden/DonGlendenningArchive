  1 Educational Soft spots
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">A comprehensive essay identifying gaps and shortcomings in Canada&#x27;s education system, particularly in PEI. Don critiques the rigidity of outcomes-based education (OBE), lack of school autonomy, absence of student advocates, and disconnection from job qualifications. He proposes five key reforms: updating OBE, increasing school-level autonomy, separate status for early childhood development, family education advisors, and establishing a qualification authority.</div>

It is widely recognized that education is a key factor in determining
one’s quality of life; in the same way, the collective education of
our citizens will determine to a significant degree the future of our
community and country. Because of this, Canada is among the world
leaders in our investment in ensuring that our citizens, especially
our youth, have access to a variety of educational activities and
experiences.  Our education system developed over decades and served
us well, however, but it is becoming rigid when the world is
demanding flexibility.  There is a gap between what Islanders have
and what they want and Islanders want to play a meaningful role in
bringing about the desired changes. 
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.14in">Education
is a lifelong process of engaging in experiences that have a
formative effect on the way we feel, think and act; this effect is
usually expressed in terms of a person’s attitudes, skills and
knowledge.  Major contributors to one’s education include one’s
self, one’s home and extended family, schools and the community at
large.   Schools play a unique role in the provision of education in
that they are the only provider of educational services allowed to
award credentials, the folded paper, so esteemed by our society.</p>

<span lang="en-GB">In recent months, the writer
has re-engaged in education by reading widely, conversing often, and
writing occasionally; this paper is the result.  He found  a
widespread interest in and understanding of the need for change,
agreement as to the nature of the desired system, but little
understanding among the public as to how the system works and  how to
bring about change.  Based on these discussions and the writer’s
knowledge and experience, the writer is of the view that the changes
that will make a difference are unlikely to be put in place without
some interventions from outside the system; this paper is presented
as one small step in the change process.</span></p>

<span lang="en-GB">As a sector, education has
some unique features, monolithic, dogmatic  and bureaucratic;
promotes from within; almost totally government operated;  offers
very limited choice to users, tightly controls its members.  It is
probably the last major holdout to technology and modernization.   As
a result, the writer is of the view that the changes desired can only
be brought about by demand from users, learners, parents, employers
and the community at large.  For this reason, this paper is written
with the user rather than the provider in mind.</span></p>

	<span lang="en-GB">Educators and the public
	alike use education and schooling interchangeably; the most frequent
	example is encompassed in the question &quot;Where did you get your

	did you go to school?&quot;  If we can differentiate hospital and
	health care, surely we can do the same for education and schooling.
	Sometimes I think that our Departments od Education should be
	renamed Departments of Public instruction.  This is further

colleague, it is the
	result of there being only one provider. Neither the employer nor
