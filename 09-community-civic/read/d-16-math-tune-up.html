<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">In
late 2013, The Community Foundation of Prince Edward Island (CFPEI)
undertook a survey of over 200 Island youth to identify issues that
directly affected them; the report, T<u>aking
the Pulse of Island Youth</u>,
available on the Foundation<span lang="en-US">’s</span>
website at <u><a href="http://www.cfpei.ca/">www.cfpei.ca</a>,</u>
provides a snapshot of the findings.  Bright
spots include a positive sense of community, emerging entrepreneurial
spirit, volunteerism and new postsecondary offerings. The main
concerns include a lack of jobs, surviving on low-paying jobs,
educational deficiencies and drug and alcohol addictions.  On the
subject of education and learning, the study reports a high rate of
completion of high school and postsecondary education, a high level
of inclusivity and relatively affordable tuition costs; young people
also expressed concerns about their readiness for the next stage of
life including:

<br />

</p>
<p align="justify" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Following
the publication of the CFPEI Report, Education 20/20 organized six
public discussions for the purpose of informing the community of the
report and its findings, learning more about youth issues in our
communities, exploring issues of education and learning, and to
identify actions to be taken to close gaps.  Discussions were lively
and wide ranging and carried on well after formal sessions ended.  
Education 20/20 retained an interest in the subject and was
encouraged to resume discussions with providers and users of
educational services, especially following the report of the Council
of Ministers in July of 2016, which said</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><br />

</p>
<p align="center" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">“<i><b>A
student’s ability to transition from secondary school to
post-secondary education and the labour market is a key measure of
the education system’s success for students” –</b></i></p>
<p align="center" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">
<i><b>CMEC, July 2016</b></i></p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><br />

</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Since then,
transition through education has been the subject of a number of
informal discussions with educators, employers, students and the
community at large.  It is the writer’s view that, at the minimum,
there is an issue of communication among parties involved or
interested in the subject, a communication gap resulting from the
number of service providers, lack of joint planning and limited
ongoing coordination.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><br />

</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Mathematics is the
study of the science of number, quantity and space; it is in demand
to some degree by all citizens,  employers, institutions and the
community at large. The Oregon Department of Education contends that
math provides “a foundation for the study of science and technology
as well as the interpretation of quantitative information in other
subjects. Mathematics may be structured
in a number of ways but structure does not appear to have a
particular influence on the quality of instruction.

<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><br />

</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">NUMERACY</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Numeracy is also
mathematics, the application of math to solve problems encountered in
every day life. Being numerate has been described as “having the
confidence and skill to use numbers and mathematical approaches in
all aspects of life - at work, in practical everyday activities at
home and beyond, as consumers, in managing our finances, as parents
helping our children learn, as patients making sense of health
information, as citizens understanding the world about s an essential
skill needed to some level by all citizens and can be learned to the
citizen level by all or practically all Islanders.  Furthermore,
helping citizens acquire math skills for citizenship is one of the
key roles of our public-school system but there appears to be no
agreement, however, as to the nature and level of citizen math and
how it should be determined.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><br />

</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><b>MATH EDUCATION </b>
</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">A person’s
education begins early; the ability to count is often quoted in
reference to a child starting school and is often used by parents to
support a view that their child is “bright”.  At the same time,
many parents, unintentionally I am sure, encourage the view that math
is difficult, and the literature tells us that a person’s beliefs
about mathematics can have a substantial impact on their interest,
their enjoyment and their motivation in math classes. 
</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><br />

</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Providers of math
instruction: in PEI include:</p>
<ol>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in"><b>The public-school system</b>
	plays a key role in increasing and formalizing each student’s
	knowledge of math.  The school system accepts all children and not
	only provides but requires math instruction each year through to
	graduation. Math to be learned is identified for each grade and
	achievement is reported to parents and the public alike. Performance
	across course offerings has become a screening mechanism in the
	transition process.</p></li>
</ol>
<p style="margin-left: 1.04in; margin-bottom: 0.14in"><br />
<br />

</p>
<ol start="2">
	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><b>Postsecondary

	majors generally; in addition, UPEI offers a math major and most
	recently created a School of Mathematics and Computational Science.</p></li>

	is a federally funded agency that purchases training under federal
	criteria.  The writer is unclear as to how instructional content is
	determined or achievement measured   Instruction in math may be
	provided by provincial schools and institutions, by employers and
	their organizations or NGO’s on behalf of clients.  Content is
	determined or agreed upon at time of purchase. Except for adult
	upgrading, there appears to be little coordination of math content
	across courses. It doesn’t appear that NGO operators can or do tap
	into available provincial instructional resources prepared elsewhere
	in the system</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><b>Private
	schools</b> offer instruction with content being aligned with the
	relevant provincial curriculum.

</ol>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><br />

</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Outcomes and
competencies themselves are “gradeless” meaning that that any
competency can be studied in public school, college and university or
independently.  What changes is the level achieved on each outcome.
As to proficiency levels, there appears to be some agreement that
differences in math levels may be attributed to three factors:</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">•	The number of
skills that can be demonstrated</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">•	Levels achieved
on skills demonstrated, and 
</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">•	Nature or degree
of clustering of skills learned.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><br />

</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Grade levels in the
public-school system are established by Department of Education;
individual student proficiency levels are awarded by teachers. 
Levels in postsecondary institutions are set in the institution. 
This in spite of the fact that awarding levels is a regulatory and
not a teaching function.  Furthermore, in the public domain
regulatory functions are usually the responsibility of a separate
body.

<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">2.	Although groups

<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Based on the
literature, the above noted discussions and the writer’s
experience, the writer concludes that:</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">1.	Math instruction
in PEI is fragmented</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">2.	Cooperation among
providers is hampered by the lack of an agreed- upon definitions of a
number of key concepts. 
</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">3.	Broadly speaking,
education lacks an overarching statement of philosophy and direction;
</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">4.	There is no
formal mechanism for coordination among math providers</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">5.	Evaluation
criteria for math should be the same for all levels of education.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">6.	Improving

<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Based on the
literature, the above noted discussions and the writer’s
experience, the writer concludes that:</p>
<ol>
	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">The transition

	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Math
	instruction in PEI is fragmented</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Grading
	students is not an instructional or school function</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Cooperation
	among providers is hampered by the lack of agreed- upon definitions
	of a number of key concepts. 
	</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Broadly
	speaking, education lacks an overarching statement of philosophy and
	direction; 
	</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">There is no
	formal mechanism for coordination among math providers</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Evaluation
	criteria for math should be the same for all levels of education.</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">The way content
	is described differs from provider to provider.</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Improving
	transition requires cooperation of all math instruction providers.</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">There is an

<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">DEFINITIONS:

</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">•	Education
– any experience that has a formative effect on the way a person
thinks, feels or acts</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">•	Mathematics
– the study of science of number, quantity, and space.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">•	Math
education – the extent and nature of a person’s attitudes, skills
and knowledge in the field of math.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><br />

</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">OBJECTIVE</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">To
initiate changes in the math offerings that maximizes opportunities
for Islanders to gain the math skills needed to thrive in in future
years.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><br />

</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">EDUCATION</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Our
futures and the future of our community will depend in large measure
on the nature and level of education gained by our citizens.
Provinces have a responsibility to help their citizens develop
attitudes, skills and knowledge at least to the level of good
citizenship; It is my view that Provinces also have a responsibility
to ensure that their communities have the skilled people needed to
care for the community in which they live.   A 2003 multi-country
study by the European Commission found that, if the national average
educational attain-ment level is increased by a single year,
aggregate productivity increases by 6.2 per cent right away and by a
further 3.1 per cent in the long run.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><br />

</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Education
is offered through a public-school system devoted to serving the
needs of young people, a relatively autonomous postsecondary sector,
the private sector and a conglomeration of services operated or
administered through provincial ministries of learning, training and
workforce development; much of the latter is paid for by federal
dollars.  There is a gap, however, between what education offers and
what the community expects.  The Council of Ministers of Education
Canada (CMEC) highlighted this concern in its statement of July 6.
2016 when it said the need to improve transition is shared by many
educators, employers, certification agencies and the community at
large.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><br />

</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">MATHEMATICS
EDUCATION 
</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">The
application of mathematics to every day life is considered essential
in every day life and, for the most part, is organized around the
conventional structure of mathematics: arithmetic, algebra, geometry,
trigonometry, calculus, probability and statistics.  The goal for
students of PEI Grade 9 mathematics is to “become mathematically
literate adults”.  It is an achievable goal, at least for most
students but, if math test scores and public comment are used as the
measure, the goal remains a challenge rather than an accomplishment. 

</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"> 
</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Providers
who deliver math services to youth follow a curriculum approved by
the Department of Education based on a Curriculum Based Outcomes
model.  Other providers base math instruction on a variety of
sources.  On the other side of the coin, “receivers” of students
have a variety of math interests and needs not always well-
documented.  The format and wording of existing math competencies
reflect educator-thinking rather than learner needs.

</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">MATH
ISSUES</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">1.	Communication,
coordination, collaboration and social capital building between and
among stakeholders.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">2.	Extent
to which resources organized for learning</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">3.	Need
for over-arching philosophy, goals and principles.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">4.	Standards
and assessment</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">5.	Transition</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">6.	Structural
impediments</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">7.	Need
for a learner centered delivery model</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">8.	Better
reporting of learner progress</p>

</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">RECOMMENDATIONS:</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Education
20/20 recommends that PEI:</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">1.	Adopt
competencies as a basis for program and curriculum development 
</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">2.	Update
curriculum development practices including the adoption of a
universal cur-riculum platform suitable for all grade levels</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">3.	Allow
students beyond Grade 9 to study at their own pace</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">4.	Develop
or adopt a dynamic/holistic rating scale applicable for study beyond
Grade nine.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">5.	Report
student achievement in Grades 10, 11 and 12 on the basis of
competencies demonstrated and levels achieved</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">6.	Adopt
a qualification stance on grading by establishing an independent
assessment body to establish levels, undertake assessment and certify
levels achieved.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">7.	Establish
a user-based math advisory committee</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">8.	Encourage
greater communication and teamwork among math professionals.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><br />

</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">BENEFITS</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">1.	Improves
support for independent learning</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">2.	Improve
communication among stakeholders</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">3.	Increase
relevance</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">4.	Increases
engagement of learners</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">5.	Improves
consistency across the system</p>
