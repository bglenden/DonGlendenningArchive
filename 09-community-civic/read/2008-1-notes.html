<p>The above noted Little Sanhedrin gathered at Casa Mia on Monday morning at: 9:00 am to discuss plans for the coming year.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A brief summary of discussions follow:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The results of our discussions will be presented to the CFPEI Board for approval: <b>(Don to place on agenda)</b> Subject to that approval, the following are proposed/recommended.</p>
<p>John reported briefly on discussions with the Province and sufficient interest for them to release Don MacDonald to us to work on the initiative</p>
<p>There was general agreement that the US citizens Day and Summer Islanders’ event are part of a larger initiative, i.e. to thank summer visitors and to harness their talents and resources in support of the things they find so attractive.</p>
<p>Agreed to recommend that the two activities operate separately again this year but that the Chair of the US Day Committee be a member of the Summer Islanders planning committee</p>
<p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Recommend that the 2008 US Citizens Day be held at the Culinary Institute (<b>Garth: will you make the initial contact?)</b><b></b></p>
<p>CFPEI proposes to undertake a survey of participants with a view to determining their interests and suggestions <b>(Donnie to lead initiative)</b><b></b></p>
<p>A committee needs to be struck; we were advised by Garth that he will participate but not chair the committee.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><b> (Suggestions for members and a chair to be submitted to Donnie ASAP)</b><b></b></p>
<p>Agreed to meet again in a month to further the planning process to address the following agenda:</p>
<p>-Facilities</p>
<p>-Committee including chair.</p>
<p>-Survey</p>
