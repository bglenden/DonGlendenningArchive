  CFPEI 61 Beach Tennis Fund
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">February 2007 newsletter documenting the Beach Tennis Club&#x27;s establishment of an endowment fund to honor founders Gordon and Helen MacDonald. The club, founded 30 years prior in Stanhope to serve summer residents, sold its land and created the Beach Tennis Club Endowment with CFPEI. Grants from the fund provide annual prizes to top junior tennis players through Sport PEI. Don includes a photo of Norman Carruthers (CFPEI President), Dr. Doug Cudmore (Beach Tennis Club President), and David Campbell (Club Secretary) signing the agreement. David Campbell recalls the club&#x27;s role as a gathering place for all ages, illustrating how Don connects recreational community institutions with lasting philanthropic legacies.</div>

	<p style="font-weight: normal">Thirty
	years ago, Gordon and Helen MacDonald were among the founders of The
	Beach Tennis Club, Inc. in Stanhope, for the benefit of the many
	summer residents in the area. Gordon gave lessons to many junior
	members at the time the Club began, and for several years after
	that.</p>
	<p style="font-weight: normal"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="font-weight: normal">In
	2005 the Club decided to sell the land and as a result created an
	award&nbsp;to honour&nbsp;the MacDonalds.   During their
	deliberations, the Club turned to the Community Foundation of PEI ,
	a group established for the sole purpose of helping individuals and
	groups develop and administer endowments - and the Foundation is now
	a partner in the venture. The public is invited to make
	contributions to the fund and will receive a charitable tax receipt
	from the Foundation.</p>

	<p style="font-weight: normal"><br />

	<p style="font-weight: normal">Grants
	from the Beach Tennis Club Endowment will be made annually to Sport
	PEI to provide a prize to the top junior male and female tennis 
	</p>
	<p style="font-weight: normal">players.</p>
	<p style="font-weight: normal"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="font-weight: normal">Club
	President Dr. Doug Cudmore and Secretary David Campbell were on hand
	to sign the agreement with the Foundation in January 2007,   which
	will see this award presented in perpetuity to these top young
	tennis players.</p>
	<p style="font-weight: normal"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="font-weight: normal">In
	speaking of the Beach Tennis Club, David Campbell recalled a packed
	summer schedule for residents of the development.  It was the 
	favoured meeting place for young and old alike.

	<p style="font-weight: normal">The
	Community Foundation is an Island wide, volunteer driven non profit
	organization whose mission is “To improve the quality of life in
	PEI by providing a vehicle for donors to meet their charitable
	interests in perpetuity at a minimum cost and a maximum
	convenience”.  CFPEI administers over 30 funds with an investment
	value totaling $900,000.  It makes grants to other Island charitable
	organizations.</p>
