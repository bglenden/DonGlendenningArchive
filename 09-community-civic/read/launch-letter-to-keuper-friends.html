<p>Dear</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>As a friend of Dr. Charles Keuper, you will know that he loved Prince Edward Island and worked diligently for the preservation of its beauty and heritage.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>To continue his work and to honour his name, the Keuper family established a Living Memorial Trust at the Community Foundation of Prince Edward Island.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The Trust is in the form of an endowment and will provide grants in perpetuity for the enhancement of public spaces.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>While funds may be used for any public space, The Foundation decided as a first priority, to plant trees at a number of entrances to Trails PEI, a network of walking trails based on the original railway lines.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Recent years has seen Trails PEI assume an increasing importance in the life of Islanders and visitors alike.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>To launch the Living Memorial Trust, and in recognition of the life of Dr. Keuper, a cluster of native red oak trees was planted at the Trail entrance in Wood Islands, the community in which the Keupers first settled when they moved to PEI.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Dr. Keuper’s son, John and his family, still live and carries on a horticultural business in the community.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>We are delighted to share this information with you and to include a newspaper clipping of the official launch.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The Living Memorial Trust is also described in the enclosed brochure together with a donation form should you want to make a donation in his memory.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The Foundation has both a US and Canadian charitable tax number.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Should you desire more information about the Living Memorial Trust or the Community Foundation, do not hesitate to let us know.</p>
<p><br></p>
