  Dear Hesta
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Letter dated March 20, 2007, from Don Glendenning to Dr. Hesta MacDonald responding to her interest in establishing a charitable legacy through a foundation. Don provides comprehensive background on community foundations, including Canadian history (first founded Winnipeg 1921, now 155 across Canada with $2.7 billion in assets), governance structure, and advantages of establishing funds within CFPEI rather than private foundations. Describes different fund types (undesignated, designated, interest) and their flexibility. References the Winnipeg Foundation&#x27;s $100 million Richardson donation and international examples of family foundations transitioning to community foundation funds. Includes CFPEI fact sheet and draft interest agreement. Exemplifies Don&#x27;s educational and advisory role in promoting community foundation philanthropy.</div>

<p>Dear Dr. MacDonald:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>As usual, I enjoyed our coffee last week; it was also great to see so many former colleagues and continuing friends.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>You mentioned your interest in setting up a “foundation” to carry on your charitable interests into the future.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I think that is appropriate.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Doing so, also relieves you and your family, of both the administration and cost of establishing a private foundation.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>As you know, I have been active in the Community Foundation of Prince Edward Island for the last two decades and am pleased to provide a few brief comments about community foundations for your consideration:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The principal business of a community foundation is to establish, build and administer charitable trusts.</p>
<p>The first Community Foundation in Canada was established in Winnipeg in 1921; today there are 155 community foundations across the country with assets of $2.7 billion.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Community foundations piloted the model which, during the last few years, financial institutions are now adopting and adapting.</p>
<p>Community foundations are directed by Boards of Directors made up of local community leaders with an interest in their community and who see community foundations as a simple, flexible, transparent, accountable and inexpensive approach enabling people to contribute to their communities in perpetuity.</p>
<p>Community Foundation administrative fees are similar across the country and, I believe, are the lowest of any in the private or charitable sector.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Our investment fees, for example, are .7 of one percent and our administration fee is one percent. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The total annual fee at CFPEI for $100,000 endowment would be $1,700 and includes the investment an administration of the funds, an annual audit, and the operation of the office, soliciting applications and making grants, the preparation of an annual report and convening of an open public annual meeting.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Endowments within community foundations offer donors different levels of involvement: (a) undesignated funds turn all the decision making over to the Directors, (b) designated funds direct CFPEI to make grants to charitable organizations identified by the donor, (c) interest funds identify a focus or field while allowing CFPEI to choose the actual organization and purpose for which a grant is given.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Even with undesignated funds, the donor, or the donor’s family, is invited to make recommendations as to the actual distribution of grants. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In discussions with potential donors, I recommend that they include an undesignated component to allow for changing needs in the charitable sector.</p>
<p>I have a friend in the Miramichi who has a private trust and is now working towards the establishment of a community foundation at which time he will transfer his endowment.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Foundation literature from elsewhere in Canada suggests that increasingly family foundations are being phased out in favour of a fund within a community foundation.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Many charitable organizations contract with community foundations for the administration of their investments.</p>
<p>In recent years, community foundations have been recipients of significant donations; the Winnipeg Foundation received over $100 million dollars from the Richardson Family, Fundy Community Foundation in St. Andrews received a donation of $1 million last year and a new community foundation in Sussex was established as a result of an estate being left to the community.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>We are aware that some donors would like their current financial advisors to continue to manage their estates including the charitable component.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>CFPEI can accommodate this interest and suggests that funds remain with the current financial advisor as long as the donor is alive.</p>
<p>CFPEI is able to provide anonymity for donors so wishing. Fund No. 1, shown on the enclosed list, reflects such a donor.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>During the past 12 months CFPEI added 10 new funds and nearly $400,000 to its portfolio. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The statement enclosed shows the value of these funds and our rate of return on investment over the last 4 years, a rate we believe to be very good given our commitment to operate as prudent investors.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Attached are a fact sheet for 2006 and a draft copy of an interest agreement.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Should you want additional information or just discuss alternatives, please do not hesitate to contact me.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Again, I commend you for your continuing interest in your community and thank you for the opportunity to provide information about the Community Foundation of Prince Edward Island.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
