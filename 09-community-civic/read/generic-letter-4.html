<p><br></p>
<p>Dear Mr. Funder:		</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>This letter comes to introduce an organization and an idea; both designed to exert a long-term positive impact on public education.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In saying this, I refer to Education First Canada Inc. an organization devoted to improving education, not only for Islanders, but for every Canadian. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The nature and quality of education will, to a large extent, determine our future as individuals, communities and countries.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We are convinced that education is important, that improvement is needed and that there is wide support for change.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>While education systems are instituting changes, the changes fall short of what is actually required; changes fail to deal with a number of underlying weaknesses such as autonomy, standards, flexibility, and engagement.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Furthermore, the required changes are not likely to happen unless the public demands it. Traditional efforts to bring about change have not worked.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Some innovative, perhaps even bold, measures are required, but we think that a better education system is worth it and we’d like to play a leading role in making change happen.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The quality of education improves when, among other things,</p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li6">Decision making and accountability is delegated to school and teacher levels</li>
  <li class="li6">The local community, and especially parents, are engaged in decision making.</li>
  <li class="li6">Stakeholders are well informed.</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p>Information is the fuel for change; it doesn’t guarantee change but certainly supports it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Compared with other services, however, information about education is in short supply.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Our health, for example, is the better for having information about cancer, diabetes, Alzheimers, the dangers of smoking as well as matters relating to our local health services.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We intend to work towards more information about <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>education matters such as early detection of reading problems, helping with homework, standards or independent study.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Our plan includes engaging educators in discussion, partnering with other organizations, encouraging innovation and rewarding best practices.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We have already convened a couple of working groups and have invited Elizabeth Jeffery, a recent national award winner, and other Island teachers, to share their views and experiences with their peers.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We’ve also had some informal discussion with the UPEI Dean of Education about engaging teachers in training in some of our activities; and we have other ideas as well including debates, competitions and presentations.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>We also are pleased to announce that the Community Foundation of Prince Edward Island supports our educational initiatives.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As a result, contributions to Education First Canada Inc. will be receipted and administered by the Foundation until our registration with Revenue is finalized.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Our group cannot make this happen alone; we need your help – both encouragement and financial support and preferably over a three year period.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I would welcome an opportunity to meet, to provide more details about our plans. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I’ll be in touch within the next few days seeking an appointment.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
