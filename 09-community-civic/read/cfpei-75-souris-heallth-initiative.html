  CFPEI 75, Souris Heallth Initiative
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Newsletter No. 75 from October 26, 2007, documents Don&#x27;s involvement in addressing a community health concern. Don met with US summer visitors Jim and Louise Wilmot who expressed concerns about professional health coverage at Souris Hospital during summer months. This led to meetings with hospital staff, regional health authorities, and government officials to discuss recruitment incentives. Solutions discussed included scholarships for healthcare students, signing bonuses, and professional development assistance. Don&#x27;s role in &quot;bringing together people for the purpose of solving community problems&quot; exemplifies his leadership approach at CFPEI. The newsletter also addresses the Foundation&#x27;s policy on fundraising and endowments.</div>

	July 4, 2006.  They live in Florida and have a summer home near

	</p>
	<p align="justify"><span style="font-weight: normal">In
	mid-summer this year, we had a coffee and conversation in
	Charlottetown.  Among other things, the Wilmots expressed a concern,
	shared by other US visitors in the Souris area, about the adequacy
	of coverage by professional staff at the Souris Hospital during the
	summer months.  </span>

	<p align="justify" style="font-weight: normal"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify"><span style="font-weight: normal">Since
	then, we had two meetings with staff from the Souris Hospital,
	Colville Manor, Department of Health and the Regional Health
	authority to discuss  what, if anything, can be done by way of an
	incentive to attract additional health care professionals to the
	Souris Hospital.  Among other things we discussed scholarships for

	<p align="justify" style="font-weight: normal">This

	</p>
	<p align="justify" style="font-weight: normal"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify"><span style="font-weight: normal">A
	number of organizations have approached us to provide support
	through the issuing of charitable receipts for fund raising
	activities; income derived through the initiative would then flow
	back to the organization doing the fund raising.</span></p>
	<p align="justify" style="font-weight: normal"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify" style="font-weight: normal">This
	is at odds with how community foundations normally operate. 
	Instead, community foundations concentrate on the development of
	endowments and do not normally compete with other charities in
	traditional fund raising activities</p>
	<p align="justify" style="font-weight: normal"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify"><span style="font-weight: normal">At
	a recent Board meeting, CFPEI decided that it will only participate
	in fund raising through the writing of receipts when the funds
	raised are added to one of the Foundation’s existing endowments. </span>
