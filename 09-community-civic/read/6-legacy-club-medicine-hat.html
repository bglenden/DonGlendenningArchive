  6 Legacy Club-Medicine Hat
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Model documentation of a similar Legacy Club program created in 2005 by the Medicine Hat community foundation, likely used as a template for CFPEI&#x27;s version. Describes five fund types (Pledged, Community, Designated, Field of Interest, and Donor Advised) with varying minimum contributions ($500-$15,000). Each tier provides different levels of donor control and charitable impact. The document demonstrates how community foundations across Canada were structuring endowment programs for diverse donor preferences.</div>

        <p><b>Medicine Hat Legacy Club</b><b></b></p>
        <p>Created in 2005 (Alberta's Centennial Year) the <b>Legacy Club</b> provides an opportunity for everyone to create and build their own community legacy,</p>
        <p>The Legacy Club runs each year and is simple, unique and lasting.  A Legacy Club membership can commence with as little as $500 received by December 31st. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
        <p><b>Legacy donations are placed in an endowment fund</b> in the chosen name of the donor.  For example it could be a family or business name or perhaps it could named in memory of a loved one.  Your fund is pooled together with other donations and invested.  The interest is then used to make grants to local Southeastern Alberta charities.  <b>The original gift is never touched</b> and becomes a never ending source of income for the community - <b>a true legacy.</b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
        <p>The type of endowment can be chosen depending on the size of the gift as follows:</p>
        <p><b>Pledged Fund </b>  (minimum $500)</p>
        <p>Allows a named fund of any category to be created.  A pledged fund requires regular contributions until the desired amount is achieved.  No disbursements are made until a minimum of $1,000 is reached.</p>
        <p><b>Community Fund </b>(minimum $1.000)</p>
        <p>Large and small gifts are combined and the income is distributed through a grant application process.  This fund ensures that the changing needs of the community are addressed in a timely manner.</p>
        <p><b>Designated Fund </b>(minimum $5,000)</p>
        <p>You choose a favourite registered charity and the income from your fund is distributed to that charity in your name every year.</p>
        <p><b>Field of Interest </b>(minimum $10,000)</p>
        <p>The Foundation will direct  the income from your fund to particular area of interest e.g. arts; youth; environment; health.</p>
        <p><b>Donor Advised</b> (minimum $15,000)<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
        <p>You advise the Foundation each year as to which charitable organizations are to benefit from the fund income.  You have the opportunity to change your focus every year.  This is an ideal way to involve the whole family or all the employees of a business.</p>
        <p> </p>
