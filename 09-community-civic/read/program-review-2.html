  Program Review-2
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">A revised January 2005 memo from Don to Ken (CFPEI Executive perspective), ccing Katy. Don reports the CFPEI Executive confirmed 2005 plans following JoAnn&#x27;s secondment ending March 31 and Marla MacDonald&#x27;s hiring as part-time office administrator. He frames the IAHSP mid-term review as appropriate timing given the program&#x27;s completed selection process, institutional analysis of first candidates, signed agreements, and upcoming second round. Objectives: confirm program meets goals, identify challenges, identify operational improvements, and extract lessons for Round Two. Proposes simple external consultant review with standardized interviews of organizations, board, partners, and potentially unsuccessful applicants.</div>

<p>Draft</p>

<p>Date:		January 17, 2005</p>

<p>To:		Ken</p>
<p>Cc:		Katy</p>

<p>From:		Don</p>

<p>Subject:	IAHSP Review</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>In recent weeks I have become concerned about the implementation of the IAHSP.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Let me be more specific.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>We are half way through the project; I think that we are well behind schedule</p>
<p>There is always a perception in projects such as this that the bulk of the money flows to administration and to consultants.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Because we have not yet flowed money to any of the organizations, this perception applies to IAHSP as well.</p>
<p>Our Board is bogged down in minutae; we need to see the big picture.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>How will the project unfold during the remaining months?</p>
<p>Fairly early in November, I raised the matter of a second round fully expecting it to be dealt with at a November meeting.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It has not been addressed yet.</p>
<p>As the result of some conversations over the holiday season, there may be more unhappiness about the program than we realize.</p>
<p>I am not satisfied with the level and quality of reporting</p>
<p>We have not met our fund raising objective and I am not aware of any concrete plan to address the issue.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>It is time for a in-depth mid-term review of the program.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I would like to have an external consultant report on :</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The extent to which the program is meeting its objectives</p>
<p>If not, why not?</p>
<p>What changes, if any, are required to insure a successful program with the initial organizations?</p>
<p>What changes, if any, should be taken into account when implementing Round Two.</p>
<p><br></p>
