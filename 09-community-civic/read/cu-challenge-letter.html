<p>Mr. Robert Gregory</p>
<p>Manager of Marketing</p>

<p>281 University Ave.</p>
<p>Charlottetown, PE<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>C1A 7M4</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Dear Mr. Gregory:</p>
<p><span>Community Advancement Program</span></p>
<p><span></span><br></p>
<p>This is a follow-up to our discussion of Wednesday, June 7, regarding your potential interest in the proposed Community Advancement Program. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>First a brief background on the Foundation.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The Community Foundation of Prince Edward Island is a not-for-profit organization established in 1993 for the purpose of improving the quality of life in our Island community.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The Foundation achieves this objective by encouraging Islanders, Island organizations and communities, to establish endowments from which grants are made out of the earnings in support of the charitable interests of the donor.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The Foundation administers the funds and ensures that the grants are made for the purposes intended.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The Foundation is governed by a board of 12 Directors from across the Island.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>In practice, The Foundation carries out four functions:</p>
<p>Informing Islanders of needs and opportunities and assisting them in designing charitable responses to match their interests and resources.</p>
<p>Providing a liaison and coordination role with individuals and organizations engaged in charitable work.</p>
<p>Making grants to reflect donors wishes.</p>
<p>Administering CFPEI including investing funds.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>In addition to on-going granting, successes in our first decade include:</p>
<p>The building of an endowment in excess of $750.000 in some 25 separate funds.</p>
<p>Attracting $150,000 from an anonymous off-island donor through which grants were made to some 60 Island charities.</p>
<p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Participating in the distribution of funds to Island charities arising from the settlement of two class action suits.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Conducing a dozen workshops for Island charities in fund raising, proposal writing and tax matters.</p>
<p>Establishing five scholarships</p>
<p>Leading an initiative that resulted in an $800,000 stabilization project in the arts field.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Based on our experience, we find that communities respond to charitable needs on a crisis basis i.e. new hospital equipment, band instruments or a family emergency; communities could benefit, we believe, from taking a broader and longer range view of existing and potential needs in the charitable sector and developing a “rainy day” fund to help meet them.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The concept is described briefly in the paragraphs that follow. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>We propose an initiative through which communities will be encouraged to establish an undesignated but named “community fund” the income from which may be used for any charitable purpose in the community consistent with Revenue Canada Regulations.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The purposes for which grants are made may change from year to year depending on emerging local priorities.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>How communities organize for the task may vary, however, participation should be broadly representative of the community.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Community endowment funds will be held by the Foundation in perpetuity and invested in a manner that ensures both long term growth and the making of grants on a regular basis.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>While a community is building a fund and as a further incentive to the initiative, the Foundation will make grant or grants to charitable organizations in the community as recommended by the local committee. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>As an example, if a community agrees to establish a fund and add to that fund at the rate of $5,000 each year for five years, the Foundation will make grants totaling $1,000 per year to a charity or charities in the community.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>At the end of five years, each participating community will have an endowment of $25,000 which is sufficient to continue granting at the same level in perpetuity.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>To make this happen, the Community Foundation of Prince Edward Island requires seed money and by means of this letter we are inviting the Credit Unions of Prince Edward Island to become a partner in the program.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We invite the Credit Union because we are aware of your broad community base, the number of communities you serve, your commitment to service and the many community development projects that you undertake.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We believe that the initiative is an ideal fit for Credit Unions and adds marketing potential throughout the Prince Edward Island.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Our preference is for a single partner and a minimum support of $100,000 – that is $20,000 per year for five years. This will result in an endowment fund of $500,000 for the benefit of Islanders an Island communities in perpetuity.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>While our working title is “Community Advancement Program”, we are open to alternatives and suggest that the name of the sponsor be a prominent component.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Should you have an interest, we would be delighted to discuss the proposal in detail and would welcome your input in shaping it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Working together, I am confident that we can make this an important and vital step in strengthening Island communities.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>We thank you for the opportunity to make a presentation.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Should you desire additional information, please do not hesitate to let me know.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Thank you for your consideration.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>John Robinson</p>
<p>President</p>
