	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">CFPEI
	representatives at the Atlantic Regional workshop of Community
	Foundations of Canada found it a useful investment of time and
	energy – and suggested others be encouraged to attend future
	gatherings.  
	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">The
	meeting occurred over two days with the main focus of the Friday
	sessions being a workshop on growing endowment funds led by Jane
	Humphries, VP of Community Foundations of Canada; this was
	especially timely given that all charitable organizations are
	wrestling with investment issues resulting from the current
	recession. The suggestion: stay calm and be honest with your donors.</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
	The
	Saturday morning session was mainly on communications; the breadth
	of services of community foundations sometimes present difficulty in
	telling the community foundation story.   “Community means so many
	things to so many people, and the world to us” said Anne-Marie
	McElrone, Director of Communications and Marketing, Community
	Foundations of Canada.</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Regional
	issues became the focus of round table discussions also on Saturday
	morning and provided an opportunity for each foundation to tell its
	story and ask its questions.  Not surprisingly, investment
	strategies during turbulent times was a major issue.  Other
	community foundations are moving more into developing community
	funds similar to the Souris Fund at CFPEI.</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">CFC
	introduced a new leadership toolkit which provides tools to
	community foundations to use in their leadership work.  Tools
	include that of assessing current community leadership activities,
	assessing organizational capacity, defining leadership goals and
	identifying a range of tools appropriate to individual goals.</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Regional
	Meetings of the Community Foundations of Canada are held every two
	years and move from Province to Province.  Approximately 20 people
	participated representing all four Atlantic Provinces. Participants
	included both volunteer directors and paid staff.  PEI was
	represented by Rogers Bell, our newest Director, and Donald
	MacDonald, our Executive Director.</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Community
	foundations, and there are about 162 in Canada today, focus on the
	needs and interests of the local community.  They connect people who
	care with causes that matter.  Their focus is on raising and
	administering endowments, the earnings from which are used in the
	form of grants to meet local community needs.  There are 10
	community foundations in Atlantic Canada.  The Community Foundation
	of Prince Edward island was established in 1993, administers forty
	funds and has assets of $1 million.</p>
