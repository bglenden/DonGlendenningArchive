<p>Discussions were held with a number of representatives of PEI Museums to highlight the existence of PEI made equipment and the need to inventory and preserve it for future generations.</p>
<p>An Agricultural Heritage Fund, an endowment, was established within the Community Foundation of Prince Edward Island.</p>
<p>Support to the PEI Association of Community Museums in its virtual display of farm equipment.</p>
<p>Several invitational meetings for the purpose of information exchange and networking for private collectors and other interested Islanders.</p>

<p><br></p>
<p>Additional dry and secure storage space is needed especially for farm equipment.</p>
<p>Linkages between museums and private collectors should be strengthened</p>
<p>There are a significant number of pieces of Island-made farm equipment that should be saved</p>
<p>A comprehensive electronic database of Island-made farm machinery and equipment should be established</p>
<p>Private collectors could benefit from technical assistance especially in conservation</p>
<p>Private collectors are interested in continuing to network and to visit other private collectors.</p>
<p>The Agricultural Heritage Fund at CFPEI should be promoted as a mechanism to provide future funding for special projects.</p>
<p><br></p>
