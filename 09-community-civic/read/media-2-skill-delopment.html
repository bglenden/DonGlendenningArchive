<div class="reader-summary">Press release titled &quot;Skill development needs a context,&quot; reporting workshop discussions that settled on a definition: &quot;increasing one&#x27;s skill to do &#x27;something&#x27;&quot; (citizenship, employment, further study, or all three). The release emphasizes foundations in home and K-12 education, proposes an independent qualification authority for consistency across the province, and suggests documentation of skills learned on the job. Other ideas include short technical courses (three months), vouchers, competency lists for job seekers, and institutional cooperation. Don Glendenning is listed as contact.</div>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 108%">The
meaning of skill development is not clear; at least that was the view
of participants at a recent workshop on the subject.  After some
discussion the group settled on “increasing one’s skill to do
“something”. That “something” could be citizenship,
employment, further study or for all three, but it needs to be clear.
 Furthermore, the foundation
for skills development lies in the home and the K-12 education system
and Successful skill development programs require a high level of
communication between all parties involved.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 108%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">As
well as learning in school or college, many people have learned new
skills on the job. It would help if the new skills were documented. 
An independent qualification authority was also proposed as a way of
improving consistency in grade levels across the Island; it would
also be a way of recognizing skills learned on the job, through on
line courses or even night classes.  
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 108%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Other
ideas included offering
short technical courses to help young people get their first job
(three months was suggested) and then providing them with a voucher
to pay for further training after they get some experience.  Other
suggestions included vouchers covering costs of courses on an
employee’s own time even at night or on weekends. Traditional
report cards lack details about skills and levels learned. One remedy
is for institutions to follow the lead of PEI Workplace Learning in
giving each student a list of competencies on completion of a that
they can show to prospective employers.</p>
