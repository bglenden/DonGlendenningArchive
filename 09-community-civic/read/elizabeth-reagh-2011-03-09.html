<p>Ms. Elizabeth Reagh</p>
<p>17 West Street</p>
<p>Charlottetown, PEI</p>
<p>C1A 3S3</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Dear Elizabeth,</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Enjoyed our conversation of the other day and appreciate your interest in discussing with the Community Foundation of Prince Edward Island the services it offers.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I know that we have spoken about the Community Foundation but thought I would provide you with a few key points<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The Community Foundation of Prince Edward Island serves the entire Province, is governed by a volunteer board widely representative of Island life, maintains an office in Charlottetown, has assets approaching $1.5 million, makes grants annually in excess of $70,000, is being used increasingly by Islanders to host their charitable legacies, is registered with both the Canada Revenue Agency and the IRS, and is transparent and open while following sound business practices.</p>
<p>Investments are professionally managed, books are audited annually and reports are public.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Although one of the newer community foundations in Canada, we are well experienced in creating and administering  endowments (over 50 at the moment) for the<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>benefit of Island organizations and individuals.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>When it comes to their charitable legacy, more and more are choosing their local community foundation; they do so for the following reasons:</p>
<p>Community foundations provide a vehicle for people to create named permanent endowment funds to support their charitable causes and interests.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Funds are invested in perpetuity, and the earnings are used to make grants on an ongoing basis for the charitable causes and interests they designate. By pooling many individual endowment funds for administration and investment purposes, community foundations are able to minimize the cost of their services and maximize the return on their investments, thus maximizing the amount available for granting.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Community foundations, and there are some 170 in Canada today, provide a simple, low cost<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>alternative to making direct disbursements to individual philanthropic organizations. This allows a person to keep one’s charitable legacy intact and flow grants to the individual charitable causes of interest on a regular basis and in perpetuity. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Elizabeth Reagh</p>

<p><br></p>
<p>The establishment of a fund with CFPEI is quite simple; it involves a one page agreement setting out the name and purpose of the fund together with the names, causes and/or organizations to which grants are to be made. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>We have a variety of arrangements depending on the needs; however, in relation to the endowment that you raised I believe a Host Organization FundAgreement or an Agency Fund Agreement would meet the charitable needs.A Host Organization Fund is when an organization entrustsfunds for investment and, as required, the charitable organization can request all or part of the accumulated income and principal less any outstanding fees. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Agency Funds are established by charitable organizations as permanent funds held by the Foundation to ensure an ongoing source of support for agency programs and operations.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The annual income is distributed to the agency.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Elizabeth, these are only suggestions and when we talk further we can explore these and look at other alternatives if required.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I will contact you in the near future to arrange a convenient time to meet and have a coffee.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
