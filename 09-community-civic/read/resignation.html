  Resignation
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">A September 2005 resignation letter from Don to Ken Gillis (IAHSP Board Chair), ccing President of CFPEI John Robinson. Don cites two concerns: (1) the Board declined his recommendation to hire an external consultant for mid-term review, instead undertaking incomplete self-review; (2) on the day addressing additional six organizations, he abstained from voting due to lack of comfort with available information about Round One strengths/weaknesses. Don reiterates recommendation for external consultant review before further financial commitments, states this would improve program delivery, and expresses continued support for the program&#x27;s potential. This resignation demonstrates Don&#x27;s high standards for accountability, his principled stand on governance issues, and his willingness to step down over matters of organizational integrity.</div>

<p>September 13, 2005</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Ken Gillis, Chair</p>
<p>IAHSP Board</p>
<p>West Royalty<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>PEI</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Dear Ken:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>As you know I have been involved with the Island Arts and Heritage Stabilization Program since its inception.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I believe in the program and its potential for having a positive impact on the arts and heritage sector in Prince Edward Island and was delighted, therefore, to become a member of the decision-making Board.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>It is with considerable regret, therefore, that I tender my resignation effective immediately.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>You will recall that, late last fall, I spoke about securing the services of an outside consultant to undertake a mid-term review.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I felt, and still feel, that information and insights gained by such a review would have been useful as we moved into the second phase of the program.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The recommendation was not made because of any knowledge that the program was not being effective.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Rather, I thought that such a review would aid future decision-making.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The Board decided not to hire an outside consultant but to undertake its own mid-term review.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I agree to the change.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A review was commenced but has not been completed.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Today dealt with proposals for an additional six organizations.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You may have noted that I participated in discussions but abstained from voting.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I did this because of my lack of comfort with the information available especially information about the strengths and weaknesses during our first round of organizations.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>In tendering my resignation from the Board, I wish you and the project well.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I also urge you, even at this late date, to secure the services of an outside consultant to undertake a review to ascertain what changes, if any, would materially improve the IAHSP Program including its delivery.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You may find that no changes are necessary; if so, I will be delighted.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If you act on this suggestion, it would probably be best not to make any further significant financial commitments until the review is completed.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Because the Community Foundation of Prince Edward Island is the body that brought the IAHSP into existance and has a continuing responsibility, I am sending a copy of this letter to its President, John Robinson, for his information.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Don Glendenning</p>
<p>62 Queen Elizabeth Drive</p>
<p>Charlottetown, C1A 3A9</p>
