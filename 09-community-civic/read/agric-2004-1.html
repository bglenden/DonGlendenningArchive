<p><b>Draft -<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>TIME \@ "MMMM d, yyyy" September 9, 2005</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>COMMUNITY FOUNDATION OF PRINCE EDWARD ISLAND</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Subject:	Farm Equipment Fund</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Background:	</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>From some time snow we have been talking with officials of the PEI Museum and Heritage Foundation about providing financial support for the recovery of early agricultural equipment, especially equipment manufactured on Prince Edward Island.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The initiative has a number of elements including:</p>
<p>The identification of artifacts</p>
<p>Retrieval</p>
<p>Restoration/refurbishment as appropriate</p>
<p>Display</p>
<p>Documentation, and</p>
<p>Demonstration</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The group leading the initiative to date consists includes: Dr. Tom Hall, Jack Cutcliffe, Henry Compton, tom LeClair and Tony Glencross.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I have been acting as chair but am in hopes of finding someone else to assume that role.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Already some implements and machinery have been retrieved as a result of our involvement in the initiative.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>One of the stumbling blocks has been the availability of suitable storage for storage artifacts.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In fact, much of their farm equipment is now exposed to the weather. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>As a result of our discussions, we, the ad hoc committee has concluded that step one is to provide funds for a storage and/or display building.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Two viable alternatives have emerged.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>One alternative is to renovate an existing barn and add sheds at each end.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Another is to construct a new shed for the same purpose.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The latter would see additional sheds of the same design spread throughout the property as their collection grows.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We are awaiting estimates for the two options, however, preliminary estimates are $30 - $35,000 for each.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I think it fair to say that most Committee members favour the renovation of the existing building because:</p>
<p>It is located directly across a walk way from the agricultural display building</p>
<p>It is an authentic farm structure</p>
<p>Cost of renovation is not out of line with other alternatives.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The system of governance is a bit unclear but we have now met with both the Province-wide Board and the Board of the Orwell Museum and they are on side.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Next steps:</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Two actions are required before the project can move forward.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The Museum Foundation needs to provide a design for the building that suits their purposes and an estimate of costs. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>At that point a letter of understanding should be exchanged between our respective organizations endure understanding of priority for storage space will be given to equipment and implements manufactured in PEI, CFPEI is making a grant to the Museum Foundation, artifacts will belong to the Museum, etc</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Fundraising<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Objective</b><b></b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The primary focus will be to provide funds for a new storage building., however it would be useful to have an endowment component from which DFPEI could make grants for such things as:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Identification and retrieval</p>
<p>Restoration</p>
<p>Public information</p>
<p>Research</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Board Action to include:</b><b></b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Approval to continue</p>
<p>Secure funds for a storage building – obviously depending on cost</p>
<p>Establish and promote an endowment<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
