<p><br></p>
<p>Dear Island Resident:		</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>As you may have gathered from my letters to the Charlottetown Guardian, I am concerned about the state of education in Canada.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I say this, based on my own experience, on what Islanders tell me, and what I read and hear. Without doubt, education is important, changes are needed, and there is wide support for change both inside and outside the system.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>It’s not easy to bring about change in any organization, and especially from the outside.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But it can and must be done.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Consequently, I’ve been working with a small group of Islanders who are of the same mind.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As a result, I am much more aware of the level of concern, required changes, and what can and should be done.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>One major change, for example, is to provide more autonomy and accountability to teachers and principals.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>While education systems are changing, changes fall short of what is actually required and fail to deal with a number of underlying weaknesses such as autonomy, accountability and engagement.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Furthermore, the required changes are not likely to happen unless the public, you and I, demand it. Traditional efforts to bring about change have not worked.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Some innovative, perhaps even bold, measures are required, but we think that a better education system is worth it.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Change is fuelled by information, however, we know that having information itself doesn’t guarantee change.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Compared with other services, education falls short in the amount of information available to users and the public.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Perhaps the most obvious comparison is with health where the media, on a daily basis it seems, carries items about cancer, diabetes, Alzheimers, the dangers of smoking as well as many other matters relating to our health.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We need that kind of attention to matters of education; practical information about early detection of reading problems, standards and<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>independent study, to name but a few.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Better educational practices are known; we need to encourage their implementation; and of course, improvements need to be encouraged and reported.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Our group, <span>Education 20/20,</span> is just getting under way.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We’ve identified a strategy to encourage and enable change, held discussions with a variety of people to explore education issues, identified approaches and projects, and are ready to put ideas into action; some activities are already under way. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Our group cannot make this happen alone; we are now looking for partners and supporters.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We are pleased to be able to say that the Community Foundation of Prince Edward Island supports this educational initiative and will administer our funds.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Contributions<b> </b>to<b> Education 20/20 Inc</b>. should be directed to the Foundation (Community Foundation of Prince Edward Island, 119 Queen Street, Charlottetown, PE<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>C1A 4B3) who will issue charitable receipts.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>But we need your help as well – both encouragement and financial support. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I would welcome an opportunity to meet, to talk first about education, to hear your ideas and questions about education, and also to explore ways that you can help.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I’ll be in touch within the next few days seeking an appointment to talk further.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
