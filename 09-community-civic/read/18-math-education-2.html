  18 Math education 2
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Policy proposal by Don Glendenning outlining his vision for improving mathematics education in Prince Edward Island through structured competency levels, independent testing services, and systemic reform addressing PISA test concerns. This reflects his broader Education 20/20 advocacy work and educational philosophy that students should be assessed by demonstrated competency rather than competitive ranking—a core principle of his education reform initiatives.</div>

<p><b><i></i></b><br></p>
<p><b>Background:</b></p>
<p><span>Islanders are concerned about the quality of their public education with these concerns arising most recently<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>from P</span>ISA test results, a recent survey by The Community Foundation of Prince Edward Island, concerns expressed by the Greater Charlottetown Area Chamber. A survey by the Prince Edward Island Home and School Federation, and a series of workshops held through the Island by Education 20/20.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>So far, the Department has neither responded<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>to nor refuted the claims, nor has it made public any plans to address them.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>While schools take the brunt of any criticism, Education 20/20 believes that the issue cannot be resolved by schools alone<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>takes the concerns seriously, believes that they require a community response as well as a school response<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Purpose: </b>Create a way to help more students reach higher levels in mathematics</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Why Math?</b></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li8">Needed for day-to-day living and is often a prerequisite for accessing many opportunities in later life</li>
  <li class="li8">Has an identifiable structure namely<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>numeracy, elementary mathematics, algebra, geometry, trigonometry, calculus, set and function, complex numbers, logarithmic functions, and infinite series</li>
  <li class="li8">Lacks a widely available and accepted analysis of outcomes or competencies</li>
  <li class="li8">Lack widely accepted agreement on levels</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>School system deficiencies:</b></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li8">Schools favour system of ranking students over assessing levels</li>
  <li class="li8">Teaching and ranking constitute a conflict of roles</li>
  <li class="li8">Lacks system of identified math levels</li>
  <li class="li8">System rejects grouping by level of difficulty</li>
  <li class="li8">Transcripts do not identify levels</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Proposal:</b></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li8"><b>Undertake an analysis</b>:</li>
</ul>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li8">Undertake a comprehensive analysis of outcomes/competencies</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li8"><b>Establish levels</b></li>
</ul>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li8">Levels –Similar to establishing levels in music and skating</li>
  <li class="li8">Rating scale</li>
  <li class="li8">Benchmarks</li>
</ul>

  <li class="li8">By request</li>
  <li class="li8">Does not offer credit</li>

  <li class="li8">On request by test taker, a record of student level may be forwarded to employer or to school</li>

<p>Provincial assessments are conducted yearly and tell us how well students are doing at key stages of learning. Students are assessed in reading, writing and mathematics at the end of Grade 3, Grade 6, and Grade 9. We also have an assessment called Early Years Evaluation (EYE) that takes place before a child goes into kindergarten.  <br>
<br>
These assessments are developed by teachers from across the province and are based on the curriculum used in Island schools. They tell us how well students are learning the curriculum, where students may need help, and how resources may be directed to improve our education system.<br>
<br>
Provincial assessments are just one of many tools used to monitor student learning. Parents should talk to the teacher about the full scope of their child’s performance. Working together with good information, parents and teachers can help students to reach their full potential.<br>
<br>
The Department of Education and Early Childhood Development also supports a national assessment which takes place every three years. The Pan-Canadian Assessment Program (PCAP) assesses the performance of Grade 8 students in reading, math and science.<br>
<br>
Every three years, Island students also take part in the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA), which assesses the achievement of 15-year-old students in reading, math and science through a common international test.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
