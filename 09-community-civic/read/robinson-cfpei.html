<p><b>John Robinson</b></p>
<p><b>I’m pleased to say a few words about John Robinson and to thank him for his support and leadership in the life of the community in general and the work of<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>the Community Foundation in particular</b></p>
<p><b>I’ve known John for 20 years, first as a successful Island business man and entrepreneur, a man, well known in the agriculture industry for progressive farming practices, leadership in the sector and stewardship of the land.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>While his business was farming, his interests included the agricultural sector and the Island as a whole.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The Robinson family was, and still is, active in their church, supporters of community organizations and events, and play leadership roles in many areas especially in supporting arts and culture.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b>I met john Robinson when he joined the Board of the Community Foundation of Prince Edward Island in 1999; he soon adopted a proprietary interest in its future, served wherever help was needed, including three terms as President.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In the early years of the Foundation, John led the Foundation in the establishment of sound investment policies and business practices.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>John recognized PEI summer visitors as significant contributors to PEI life, especially to our arts and culture, and took steps to engage them in summer activities, most notably a reception on July 4 for US visitors and a summer lecture series so that guests could get to know the Island he loved. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b>Perhaps his greatest contribution, however, was that of positioning the<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Foundation as a key component of the provinces infrastructure, a component committed to building a pool of funds to be available in perpetuity for the betterment of the Island community – and he is having<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>considerable success.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Under his direction, and thanks to his energy and leadership, Foundation now has<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>assets<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>of thirteen million dollars – and he has visions for continuing growth.</b></p>
<p><b>In addition to the above, John has an unusually high commitment to the cause of community foundations, is a fine person, a respected member of the community, a world traveler, a gracious host, a beloved father and grandfather, and a good friend.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I can think of no better person to epitomize the concept of a smart and caring community</b></p>
<p><b>I now know him as a friend, someone interested in wat I’m up to, my family, my woodlot , the Foundation ‘ and the community at large. Thank you, John for your many contributions to me, my family and our chosen home.</b></p>
<p><b>Sincerely</b></p>
<p><b>Donald Glendenning<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>C.M.</b></p>
