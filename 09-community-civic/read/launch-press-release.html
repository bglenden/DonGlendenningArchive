<p><b><i>Draft Press Release for July 21, 2007</i></b></p>
<p><b><i></i></b><br></p>
<p><b>Living Memorial Trust Established</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The Wood Islands entrance to Trails PEI looks different today, and will be significantly different in 20 years, thanks to the planting of two clusters of native red oak trees.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The planting is the first initiative of the Community Foundation of Prince Edward Island under the newly established Living Memorial Trust from which grants will be made for the purpose of enhancing public spaces throughout Prince Edward Island.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The Living Memorial Trust was established through the efforts of the Keuper Family to remember the life of Dr. Charles Keuper, a physician who came to PEI after retirement in 1979 and worked tirelessly to protect and enhance the Island’s natural beauty.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Dr. Keuper was born in Schulenburg, Texas, received his higher education at Elmhurst College, Illinois and the University of Texas.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>After a stint as a Medical Officer with the United States Army in Japan, Dr. Keuper opened a practice in Boston and taught for a number of years at Harvard Medical School.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Upon retirement, the Keuper family set up residence in Wood Islands. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Living Memorials are more than just a tribute; living memorials enhance and beautify our environment, provide shelter for wild life, reduce erosion and improve the quality of the air we breathe.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Grants may be made for the enhancement of any public space, however, the initial focus will be on trail entrances.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Contributions to The Living Memorial Trust are welcomed to mark a milestone in the life of a person or organization and all donations will be recorded in a Memorial Register.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Individual interested in plantings in places of special significance should contact the Foundation.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Donors will be given a receipt to be used when filing Income Tax returns in Canada or the USA<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
