<p>August 23, 2013</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Tom Davies, President</p>
<p>Community Foundation of Prince Edward Island</p>
<p>Suite 105, 119-121 Queen St.</p>
<p>Charlottetown PE, C1A 4B3</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Dear Mr. Davies</p>
<p>Glendenning Family Fund</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>As you know, the Glendenning Fund was set up a few years ago in memory of Elmer and Jane (Watling) Glendenning and to honour their contributions to their community, Black River Bridge, New Brunswick.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Since its inception, grants have been made for a variety purposes including books to Miramichi Rural School, to celebrate the anniversary of St. Paul’s Presbyterian Church, to commemorate the 200th anniversary of the first land grants in the community and an award to the Miramichi Historical Society for a history prize.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Our original goal was $5,000; as you know, the Fund now stands at around $17,000; our new target is $25,000.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When the fund reaches that goal, we propose to convert it to the Glendenning Scholarship in support of a person from the community pursuing further studies at the postsecondary level; at the moment, that would likely be the University of New Brunswick, University de Moncton, Mount Allison University, Saint Thomas University and the New Brunswick Community College,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>but not a private institutions; in saying this, we recognize that other institutions may be established in the years ahead.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Notice should also be sent to the James M Hill Memorial High School, the high school that serves that area of New Brunswick.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>While the above is our current plan, we do reserve the right, however, should a project of special interest arise, to use the income on occasion to make a grant for another purpose.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This change would be triggered by communication from Lois Anne (Glendenning) Gregan, Janet Glendenning and me who constitute a “family” advisory committee.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>We are delighted with what we’ve been able to do with earnings from the fund and thank you for your support.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Don Glendenning</p>
<p>Cc: 	LoisAnne (Glendenning) Gregan</p>
