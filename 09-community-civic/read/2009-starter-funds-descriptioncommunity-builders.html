<p><b>COMMUNITY BUILDERS LEGACY FUND</b><b></b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>WHAT IS A COMMUNITY BUILDER?</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span><b>Community Builders</b></span><b> </b>are people who are interested in making Prince Edward Island an even better place to live – both for this generation and generations to follow.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Community builders want to give back to their community and want to start doing now.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Community builders are thinkers, planners, and doers in all walks of life.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They realize that their successes resulted from help by many people and, through establishing a legacy fund; they can say thanks while making the community a better place for others.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>WHAT DO COMMUNITY BUILDERS DO?</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span><b>Community Builders</b></span> can be recognized by what they do, even though all community builders do not do the same thing.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Some build quietly and out of sight, others build publicly; most have a passion whether for the environment, heritage, education, health, religion, or the general welfare of friends and neighbours.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They are active in volunteering, contributing, leading, supporting and giving.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They help out today but also think about tomorrow.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They also set aside funds to support their passions even when they are no longer here to do so.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>WHAT IS A LEGACY FUND?</b><b></b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span><b>A Legacy Fund</b></span> is an endowment the income from which is available in perpetuity to support good works and causes identified by the community builder.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Such endowments may be created at the time of death; however, increasingly community builders participate in both the planning and building of an endowment while they are still alive.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In this way, they can participate in the design of their legacy and the decision-making as to which causes gifts may be given.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Community builders also may, if they so desire, continue as advisors to their investments even after assigning ownership to CFPEI.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>HOW DOES ON START A LEGACY FUND?</b><b></b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span><b>Starting a Legacy Fund</b></span> is easy.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The first step is to talk to someone at the Community foundation of Prince Edward Island.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They will explain options available and the procedures to be followed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Once your interests and approach becomes clear, you shoulod talk with your financial advisor about what you can afford and how you will ay for it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The actual establishment is easy.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You make a contribution and receive a charitable receipt.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Then you enter a simple agreement with the Foundation setting out the name and purpose of the fund<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>and the conditions, if any, guiding the disbursement of grants. Agreements confirm any discussions between the donor and the Foundation as to how the funds will be invested, purposes for which grants will be given and related matters.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The actual paperwork takes only a few minutes to comlete and you receive a copy for your records.</p>
