<p><b>COMMUNITY FOUNDATION OF PRINCE EDWARD ISLAND</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Living Trust<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b>1. Background</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>Living trusts are green spaces set aside to honour, recognize, or remember a person, place or event; the key characteristic is that it is a natural space where life continues to thrive<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A Living Trust may be as simple as a single tree or bush but also may be a garden, a park or a forest. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Living Trusts are more than just a tribute; they enhance and beautify our environment, provide shelter for our wildlife, reduce erosion and improve the quality of the air we breathe.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Living trusts may bring comfort, hope and peace to visitors and ensure that generations to come will know the loveliness of a green plant. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>In addition to actual living plants and, depending on the nature of the space, green space enhancement may also include comfortable benches on which to rest, a viewing platform, path enhancement, footbridges, picnic areas, wildlife areas, handicap accessibility, and erection of shelters. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Typical sites include schools, hospitals, municipalities, other public lands including the Confederation Trail.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>2. The CFPEI Living Trust</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Initial funding for The Living Trust at the Community Foundation of Prince Edward Island was provided by the family of the late Dr. Charles Keuper, a retired physician who had a deep love for the natural beauty of his adopted home.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Dr. Keuper was an avid and tireless worker in the establishment of Trails PEI and a person who savoured outdoor life to the full.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Through the Living<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Trust, Dr. Keuper’s family honors his memory and encourages others with similar interests to do likewise.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The Living Trust is administered by The Community Foundation of Prince Edward Island, a non-profit organization managed by a volunteer Board of Directors, which oversees permanent endowments set up by members of the community.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The purpose of the Living Memorial Trust is to make grants to enhance outdoor public green spaces throughout Prince Edward Island.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>3	Options</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>While the Living Trust supports the enhancement of public spaces throughout the Island, initially we have partnered with the Government of Prince Edward Island to plant trees where public roads and the Confederation Trail intersect.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>At these sites, we have identified the following options:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>A donation in any amount to support the general planting of trees</p>
<p>The name of a person, organization or activity will be recorded and associated with a planting event at a designated site but individual trees will not be identifiable. This requires a minimum donation of<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>$25.00<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>A tree, with an appropriate plaque, in the name of a person, organization or event is available for a contribution of $250. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>A three tree cluster of Island Oaks is available for a donation of $1,500.</p>
<p>Customized plantings in any public space may be arranged through the Foundation.</p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><span><b>4	</b></span><b>Why donate</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>People donate to a Living Trust for all of the reasons outlined in the opening paragraphs.</p>
<p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In terms of life-changes, however, we usually think of</p>
<p><span class="Apple-converted-space">      </span></p>
<p>retirements,</p>
<p>the birth of a child or grandchild,</p>
<p>the death of a family member, friend or colleague,</p>
<p>a thank you to a friend</p>
<p>recognition of outstanding service</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>In terms of special occasions where we wish to honour and celebrate we think of:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Christmas</p>
<p>Eid</p>
<p>Hanukkah</p>
<p>Valentines</p>
<p>Mother’s Day</p>
<p>Father’s Day and all other holidays where gifts are given.</p>
<p>Special birthdays, particularly the numbers 25, 50 and 80</p>
<p>Anniversaries</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>5	Planting History and Plans</b><b></b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Our planting history includes:</p>
<p>The Living Trust was inaugurated on July 21, 2007 when a cluster of Island red oaks was planted on each side of the entrance to the Confederation Trail at Wood Islands in memory of Dr. Charles Keuper.</p>
<p>The 2008 planting is planned for the entrance to the Confederation Trail on the North Yorke River Road.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>At that time, a tree will be planted in memory of Martha Burka of York Point. In addition, general donations from the Living Trust make possible the planting of a number of undesignated trees along the trail. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
