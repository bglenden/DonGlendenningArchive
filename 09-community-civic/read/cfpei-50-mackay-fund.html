Fund income supports grants for improving public awareness, training, and equipment for cardiac emergency response. Fund created following MacKay&#x27;s 2002 cardiac stress on golf course in PEI; he died at O&#x27;Leary Hospital.

CFPEI administers 25 endowments reflecting diverse community and donor interests.</div>

	David A. Mackay Endowment Fund was officially launched in
	Summerside, PEI on August 5, 2006.  On the left above is John

	</p>
	<p align="justify" style="font-weight: normal">Family
	and friends of the late David A. Mackay gathered in Summerside on
	August 5, 2006 to formally announce the establishment of the David
	A. MacKay Endowment Fund.  The Fund was set up to honour the life of
	David A. MacKay, an Islander by birth who went on to a very
	successful business career in Canada and the USA.  His greatest
	passion was building MacKay and Hughes of Toronto into the largest
	fresh potato distributor in North America.</p>
	<p lang="en-CA" align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p lang="en-CA" align="justify" style="font-weight: normal">The
	David A. MacKay Endowment Fund is one of a number of funds within
	the Community Foundation of Prince Edward Island, a non-profit
	organization administered by a volunteer board of directors, which
	oversees permanent endowments set up by members of the community. 
	The Foundation is a registered charity and all donations are tax
	deductible in Canada and the USA</p>
	<p lang="en-CA" align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify" style="font-weight: normal">Income
	from the Fund will be used to make grants, for improving public
	awareness, for training, and for equipment directed towards
	improving the response to cardiac emergencies.</p>
	<p lang="en-CA" align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify" style="font-weight: normal">The
	idea was born out of the fact that Mr. Mackay went into cardiac
	stress on a golf course on PEI in 2002 and died shortly after at the
	O'Leary Hospital.  The intent of the MacKay Fund is to provide
	grants to improve the response to such emergencies.  <br />
<br />
In
	his remarks, John Robinson, President of the Community Foundation
	and both a personal friend and business associate of Mr. Mackay,
	thanked the family for this unique contribution to the health care
	field in PEI.  “Community foundations,” said Mr. Robinson, “are
	concerned about all aspects of the quality of life on Prince Edward
	Islanders and specialize in designing responses that reflect the
	donor interests.</p>
	<p align="justify" style="font-weight: normal"><br />

	<p align="justify" style="font-weight: normal">CFPEI
	currently administers 25 endowment funds reflecting a wide range of
	both community and donor interests.  For information, or to make a
