A couple of months from now an Island school or learning centre will
receive a cheque for $2,500, and they can spend it for whatever they
want.  They will receive the award because of the nature and  extent
to which students are engaged in learning activities, and the
engagement of parents and other community members as well.  And all
this happens because of there is a  positive relationship between
engagement and learning.</p>

Engagement comes in many forms like the Future Local Forums for Grade
9 French students, the Junior Achievement activities in Kinkora; a
translation service for newcomers, quality of communications between
home and school, cross cultural events and the use of technology.  It
is not simply a matter of a teacher and a class, it involves a school
wide initiative of diffwrent classes, even different ages, working
together and working with other members of their community. The range
of activities reflects the interests and skills in the community. 
Schools aren’t all expected to do the same thing but they must do
things, not just because they received extra money for a project, but
they know it is good for learning and the community.</p>

<span lang="en-US">This award is made possible because of the
generosity of an Island family that also believes that engagement and
achievement go hand in hand.  Education 20/20 has identified five
kinds of engagement, student to student, student to teacher, student
to learning material, student to community, and parent involvement;
and there are likely others.  Anyone can nominate a school or
learning centre; further information and forms are available at
</span><u><a href="http://www.education2020.ca/"><span lang="en-US">www.education2020.ca</span></a></u><span lang="en-US">.
But act soon.  Nominations close on March 29 and the school or
learning centre that wins the award could have its $2,500 cheque in
May.  </span>
