<div class="reader-summary">A memo from Don dated October 28, 2005, to Margaret, Norman, Tom, and Bruce following a Souris meeting. Don reflects on the positive discussion and shares his strategic thoughts on promoting the Souris Fund through churches, establishing it as an endowment, and creating memorial giving opportunities. He suggests reporting on the initiative at the CFPEI Board meeting, demonstrating his leadership role in the foundation&#x27;s work.</div>

<p>Subject:	Souris Meeting</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>We had a great discussion in Souris last night; thanks Margaret for making it happen.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Here are my thoughts/understandings and ideas arising therefrom:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Attached is a draft Special bulletin as a hand out at churches or elsewhere to people in the area.</p>
<p>We agreed to approach local churches to put something in a church bulletin<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Here is a suggestion:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>“<i>A Souris Fund has been established through an anonymous donation to the Community Foundation of Prince Edward Island. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The Fund is in the form of an endowment so that only the earnings may be used for making grants; grants may be made to any charitable organization in the Souris area.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Further information is available in a handout at the back of the church, from Margaret Ching (902) 357-2741 or from the Foundation (902)-892-3440.”</i></p>
<p><i></i><br></p>
<p>Another meeting is planned for second week in January to include representatives from communities outside Souris and representatives from charitable agencies.</p>
<p>We should pursue the idea that contributions can be made to the Souris Fund as memorials. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Attached is a copy of the press release sent to the Eastern Graphic.</p>
<p>I suggest that we report on and discuss this initiative at our next Board meeting.</p>
