  19 news A2 Let- Getting help in Souris
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Letter discussing education service gaps in Souris, PEI. Don observes that while schools and counsellors serve students, no accessible resource exists for non-enrolled residents seeking education information and advice (personal development, job changes, family support, etc.). After Google searching &quot;Souris development&quot; and related terms, he found no integrated education resource center. Don proposes appointing an Area Coordinator through the Department of Education to ensure community-wide service delivery. This letter reflects his community-focused perspective and concern for inclusive, accessible education services beyond traditional school populations.</div>

<p><b>Getting help in Souris</b></p>
<p>Some time ago, I was waiting for friends at the Evergreen Restaurant in Souris when I was struck with the question as to where Souris residents obtain information and counselling on matters of education, We could ask the same question in any community.</p>
<p>Students can talk with teachers and counsellors but what about the people who are not in school? People may be thinking about furthering their education for many reasons: personal interest, self-development, job change or updating, to help children or grandchildren, to improve job performance, to improve quality of life in the community, and to help attract and retain businesses. Whatever the reason, where does a person or organization turn for information and advice? <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>On returning home, I Googled “Souris development, Souris business development and Souris education” to see what I could find.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I used “development” as a keyword because educating is a developmental process but I also know that education is an important tool in educational development; I found schools, business development offices, career services and a few other things, but none struck me as being place where I could drop by for help.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The need for independent information and advice becomes even more important as we move more deeply into the 21<sup>st</sup> century</p>
<p>One solution, of course would be for the Department of Education to appoint<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>an area Coordinator to ensure that the people get the services they deserve; and some day when school boards find favour, to appoint a Board of Education rather than school trustees to ensure that all citizens are served not just youngsters in school</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p><br></p>
