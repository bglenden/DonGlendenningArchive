<p>Draft - January 10, 2005</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Dr. Hesta MacDonald</p>
<p>206 Spring Park Road</p>
<p>Charlottetown, PE	C1A 3Y9</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Dear Dr. MacDonald:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>This will confirm our recent discussion and your interest in establishing the _______________ <b>Endowment</b>.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As you know, I believe that the establishment of an endowment is an appropriate way to reflect your long term interest in the betterment of your community.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Based on our discussions, it is my understanding that:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The Fund shall be known as the<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>____________________________ (The Fund).</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The establishment of the Fund is accompanied by a donation in the amount of $_____ at time of signing for which a charitable receipt will be issued. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>From time to time, The Community Foundation of Prince Edward Island (The Foundation) may accept additional contributions to The Fund and issue charitable receipts as appropriate</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Income from investments is to be used for the making of grants for any charitable purpose.<i>	</i></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span>3.	The Fund, including future contributions, will be maintained as a permanent endowment for charitable purposes, without expenditure of principal.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>4.	The Foundation will promote The Fund in its reports and promotional materials.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>5.	The Foundation may charge a management fee, currently set at one (1%) percent per year, which is consistent with charges to other funds of<i> </i>similar size and nature<i> </i>under its administration. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>6.	Income shall be calculated annually based on the increase in the Fair Market Value of The Fund and is available for distribution at the end of The Foundation’s financial year. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Income not paid out shall be reinvested.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>.8.	The Foundation shall have authority and control over all property in and income from The Fund, as is consistent with Provincial and Federal regulations, the Foundation’s charitable purposes, and Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws.</p>
<p>								</p>
<p><span></span><span>Although assets of The Fund may be combined with other assets of The Foundation for purposes of investment, The Fund will be separately identified in Foundation reports.</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>10.	A portion of the income generated, if any, will be reinvested and become part of the principal of The Fund to ensure the relative value of The Fund in perpetuity.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>11.	The Foundation agrees to make public information about The Fund at least annually.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Although the Fund is undesignated, The Community Foundation of Prince Edward Island welcomes your suggestions as to the nature of grants that will reflect your charitable interests.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Information about The Foundation including a Statement of Investment Policies and Guidelines, which may be amended from time to time to meet changing market conditions, was provided at an earlier date, however, we would be pleased to provide additional information or discuss the work of The Foundation or the operation of the fund should you be interested.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Should this agreement reflect your interests and understandings, please sign both copies and return one to this office. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Should you desire changes to this agreement, please do not hesitate to contact me. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This agreement may be modified at any time through mutual agreement.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Thanking you for your support.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Sincerely,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Donald Glendenning</p>
<p>Director</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
