  2010  07 Challenge Funds
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">July 4, 2010 proposal to establish CFPEI Challenge Fund offering financial incentives for endowment creation/expansion. Models include matching funds, arts partnership matching (1:4 multiplier with DOCH), and flow-through grants. Short-term goal $100,000; long-term $1,000,000. Open to all sectors except faith-based/partisan (unless donor-initiated). Reflects Don&#x27;s sophisticated understanding of leverage financing to democratize access to professional fund administration for smaller organizations unable to sustain independent fundraising. Shows innovative thinking about sector-wide capacity building.</div>

<p><b>July 4, 2010</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>CHALLENGE FUNDS</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>We’ve spoken on occasion about offering a financial incentive to organizations or individuals to encourage the creation or expansion an endowment fund held by CFPEI.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Although CFPEI has not used that approach, it has been involved in two instances where we were challenged.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>PROPOSAL:</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>That CFPEI adopt the challenge fund idea as a mechanism for encouraging charitable organizations to ensure their future through the establishment of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>BENEFITS:</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>All donations flow through to a charity with multipliers varying from 1-5</p>
<p>A selling point to both CFPEI and the donor when soliciting</p>
<p>Builds for the long term</p>
<p>Builds another stream of income for charitable causes</p>
<p>Future governments<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>will be unable to deliver the dollars that charitable issues need</p>
<p>Currently only the larger organizations can afford to undertake significant fundraising initiatives</p>
<p>Large organizations are getting a disproportionate share of charitable dollars</p>
<p>The future of charitable organizations is one way to ensure the balanced society that the Island needs</p>
<p>CFPEI is the only charitable secorganization commited to long term support for the broad charitable sector in PEI</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>MODELS</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>There are a number of approaches to issuing challenges including:</p>
<p>Matching funds.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In our initial challenge, CFPEI was offered $100,000 to flow through as grants on condition that we build a matching endowment.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In this case, we were also provided with some money for administrative purposes.</p>
<p>In the case of the Arts Stabilization Program, we were one of four partners and were required to raise $200,000 from the private sector.</p>
<p>DOCH has established a matching grant fund whereby they will match endowment funds established by approved arts organizations; the endowment funds must be hosted by a community foundation.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Indian River Festivalhas entered such a partnership agreement and received its first matching grants.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The following additional arts organizations are eligible: College of Piping, Victoria Playhouse, Carrefour, Jubilee Theatre, PEI Symphony Orchestra and the Confederation Centre. In this instance, a challenge of $1,000 to an arts organization for matching funds could result in a $4,000 addition to the endowment</p>
<p>CFPEI has offered to provide a $1,000 flow-through grant to a charitable cause in Souris as soon as the Souris fund is increased by $5,000.is finalizing arrangements to apply the same approach to expansion of the Visual Arts Fund</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>THOUGHTS:</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Endowments to be the property of CFPEI</p>
<p>That CFPEI create a multi-purpose challenge fund<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Name of fund: ??(charitable incentive Funds, Futures Fund, Next Generation Fund, New<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Heritage Fund, Growth fund,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>or??</p>
<p>Goal: $100,000 short term; $1,000,000 long term</p>
<p>Granting strategy: open but including any or all of the above</p>
<p>Open to<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>all sectors<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Faith-based or partisan political organizations included only if initiated by a donor wishing to offer the challenge.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>RECOMMENDATION:</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>That we identify a small committee of Directors and community members to spearhead the initiative</p>
<p><br></p>
