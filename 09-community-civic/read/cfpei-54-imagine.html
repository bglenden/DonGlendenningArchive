  CFPEI 54-Imagine
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">This October 2006 newsletter addresses misconceptions about endowments, explaining that they need not require large sums and can be built over time. Don provides concrete examples: $1,000 annually for five years generates $200 perpetual grants, life insurance policies offer tax deductions, and stock donations save taxes. He emphasizes CFPEI&#x27;s accessibility and volunteer-managed board of PEI-based directors, promoting the foundation&#x27;s one-percent annual administration fee as unbeatable. This educational approach demonstrates Don&#x27;s commitment to democratizing philanthropy and making charitable giving accessible to islanders of modest means, reflecting his leadership philosophy at Holland College and beyond.</div>

	<p align="justify">Imagine an Endowment 
	</p>
	<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 0.5in; text-indent: 0.5in">
	<i><u>With Your Name on It</u></i></p>
	<p align="justify" style="font-weight: normal"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify"><span style="font-weight: normal">But,
	you say, endowments are only for folks with lots of money – and
	that’s not me.  At least, that may be the impression you get when
	endowments are announced.</span></p>
	<p align="justify" style="font-weight: normal"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify"><span style="font-weight: normal">Let’s
	start with the question, “How much money does one need to
	establish an endowment?  The short answer is, “It depends upon
	what you want to do.” Endowments may be large or small depending
	on your interests and resources - and they can be built over a
	number of years.  </span>
	</p>
	<p align="justify" style="font-weight: normal"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify"><span style="font-weight: normal">Many
	of our endowments have been set up through contributions by one or
	more people and over a period of time. For example:</span></p>
	<p align="justify" style="font-weight: normal"><br />

	</p>
	<ul>
		<li><p align="justify" style="font-weight: normal">$1,000
		per year for five years will provide your favourite charity with a
		grant of $200 per year in perpetuity.</p></li>
		<li><p align="justify"><span style="font-weight: normal">A
		life insurance policy made out to the Foundation allows you to
		claim your premium as a charitable deduction.</span></p></li>
		<li><p align="justify"><span style="font-weight: normal">You
		can donate stocks or a work of art and save taxes.</span></p></li>
		<li><p align="justify"><span style="font-weight: normal">$100,000
		willed to the Foundation would go a long ways in supporting a young
		person from your community while pursuing postsecondary education.</span></p></li>
	</ul>
	<p align="justify" style="font-weight: normal">Community
	foundations are set up to help you do all of the above – and more.</p>
	<p align="justify" style="font-weight: normal"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify"><span style="font-weight: normal">Community
	foundations are set up to enable people to make grants to support
	the organizations and activities in which they are interested. 
	Community foundations represent you, the donor; they make your
	wishes a reality.  A community foundation can help you clarify your
	charitable interests, describe what you want done, administer and
	invest the money, complete the reports required by Revenue Canada,
	report on fund growth and issue receipts.  And at a very reasonable
	cost – just one percent of the principal each year.  You won’t
	do better than that.</span></p>
	<p align="justify" style="font-weight: normal"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify"><span style="font-weight: normal">The
	Community Foundation of Prince Edward Island is managed by people
	you know or whose name you recognize.   The Directors live on Prince
	Edward Island and they volunteer their time and talents to make it
	easy for you to give to the charitable causes that interest you.</span></p>
	<p align="justify" style="font-weight: normal"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify"><span style="font-weight: normal">All
	you have to do is make a contribution; the Foundation does the rest.</span></p>
	<p align="justify" style="font-weight: normal"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify"><span style="font-weight: normal">Give
	us a call.  We would be happy to talk with you.  There is no
	obligation or commitment – even if you decide not to set up an
	endowment, the experience of thinking it through may be helpful.</span></p>
