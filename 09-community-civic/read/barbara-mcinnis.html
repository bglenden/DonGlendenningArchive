<p>Date:		August 14, 2007</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>To:		Barbara McInnis</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>From:		Don Glendenning</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Subject:	Community foundations</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Greetings from Prince Edward Island.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I am not sure that I have any observations of value when writing your book but here are a few comments:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>First let me point out some of the unique problems of asset building in a small community and small province.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is likely that many of this same problems exist in other remote communities in this country and countries as well.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Headquarters for many of potential corporate donors/sponsors are most often located in another Province not just another part of the Province.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The larger the company the more likely that its headquarters is Montreal, Toronto or Vancouver.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is not easy, and sometimes expensive, to meet the decision-makers. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>We have a large out migration of young<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>people, therefore, many of our successful young entrepreneurs do not live on PEI.</p>
<p>On the other hand, contacting and convening key decision-makers or stakeholders is, I believe, easier to accomplish.</p>
<p>In the case of PEI, the big four in fund raising are the University, two hospitals and the Confederation Centre.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>While we have cordial relations with all, we have not found a way yet to partner in a significant common venture.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>With regard to your specific questions:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I’d like to see more emphasis on the leadership role of community foundations.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We underestimate the importance of our non-monetary contributions.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The process of convening stakeholders to solve problems has tremendous potential.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The issue of asset development versus leadership/liaison poses a dilemma.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A community foundation needs an endowment to address local needs (make strategic grants), at the same time, many important contributions can be made by convening stakeholders.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Community foundations should be viewed as part of the infrastructure of a community.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Like a highway, a power line, a bank or a telephone system, a community foundation is a mechanism for the use of persons who have the means to effectchanges in their communities</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>While the ideal is undesignated funds, in fact, in PEI there are millions of dollars in small funds managed/invested by volunteers out of duty rather than interest.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I believe the current system to be inefficient and see the management of existing funds as a real service to our community.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I know that this is at odds with much of the thinking of many community foundations.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I’ve had some involvement in international education in a number of countries. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The idea of self-help in the charitable sector did not enter any discussions.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Would there be any value in providing development officers/NGOs with an understanding of community foundations as a tool for community development?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>In Eastern Europe, I believe, the concept of charitable giving is not well developed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Stressing convening rather than asset development may be a more acceptable weay to initiate change.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Women are often a primary force for community development in other cultures.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Whether or not this has any import for what you are writing, I do not know.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Good luck with your book.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Warm personal regards</p>
<p><br></p>
