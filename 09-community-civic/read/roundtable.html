  Roundtable
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">A formal proposal for a one-day Literacy Roundtable convened by the Community Foundation to bring together practitioners, providers, and stakeholders for dialogue and information sharing. The invitational event would focus on &quot;the interface between learner and teacher&quot; and accommodate diverse providers. Participants would present concerns in succession without debate, followed by thematic discussion of topics including diagnosis, teaching methodologies, assessment, and reporting. The proposal emphasizes non-attributable discussion to encourage candor, with expected deliverables including scheduled follow-up discussions, fact sheets, and potentially a &quot;Society for the Promotion of Literacy.&quot; This reflects Don&#x27;s belief in the power of structured dialogue to overcome institutional silos.</div>

<p><b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Subject:	Literacy Roundtable</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Background:	</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Evidence abounds as to the importance of literacy for both our individual and community welfare.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Becoming literate is a very personal experience.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In PEI, responsibility for literacy lies with a number of agencies and organizations.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A couple of years ago, the Foundation was in touch with a number of providers and, while there is a wealth of information and services available, there appears to be little coordination or exchange of at the front line level.</p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>The Foundation:</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>Community foundations, and thee are 170 in Canada today, are relatively new and unique part of the third sector in that they have a community focus, are committed to improving the quality of life in their community, act as hosts to individuals and organizations wishing to establish a trust, <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Foundations also act as conveners of groups for the purpose of sharing information or solving problems.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This proposal is an example of the latter function.</p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Proposal:</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>The Community Foundation of Prince Edward Island proposes to convene a roundtable, for people intimately involved in the delivery of literacy education, for the purpose sharing information but also to identify gaps, if any, where the Foundation may be of service.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The roundtable will:</p>
<p>Be invitational</p>
<p>Be of one day’s duration</p>
<p>Focus on the interface between learner and teacher</p>
<p>Accommodate a wide spectrum of providers<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Be free to participants</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Format:</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>Following opening remarks, each participant will be expected to speak briefly on some aspect or concern about literacy; this will be followed by an equally brief opportunity for questions or clarifications but not for debate.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The second round of discussion will focus on items arising from the morning’s presentations.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Based on our earlier explorations, topics will likely include diagnosis, teaching/coaching, levels of literacy, rating scales, assessment and reporting.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A more precise agenda can only be put together after initial discussions. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Roundtable guidelines:</p>
<p>Each person at the table is expected to participate in the discussion</p>
<p>While what is discussed may get wider coverage, participants agree not to attribute comments following the roundtable</p>
<p>Participants are encouraged to bring and share resource material</p>
