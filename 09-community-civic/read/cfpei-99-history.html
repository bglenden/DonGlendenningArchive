	A Brief History</p>
	<p align="justify"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">In<span style="font-weight: normal">
	the spring of 1986, members of the Charlottetown Rotary Club heard a
	presentation from a founding member of the Greater Moncton Area
	Community Foundation.  He was a passionate believer and had
	committed $10,000 per year for ten years to its establishment.</span></p>
	<p align="justify" style="font-weight: normal"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">Some<span style="font-weight: normal">
	Rotarians (Stan MacPherson, Bob Hutchison, Walt Wheeler, Stuart
	Drummond and Tom DeBlois), also members of the Executive of the
	United Way of PEI, decided to explore moving the idea further.  Bob
	Hutchison, on behalf of the group, asked Don Glendenning to take a
	look at the idea </span>
	</p>
	<p align="justify" style="font-weight: normal"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">As<span style="font-weight: normal">
	 part of the information gathering process, Glendenning r</span><span style="font-weight: normal">eviewed
	the literature, talked to knowledgeable people, contacted 9 US based
	foundations, contacted 20 Canadian foundations and consulted
	formally and informally with 32 people of the community including,
	as I recall, three meetings held in the lecture theatre of Holland
	College.</span></p>
	<p align="justify" style="font-weight: normal"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">During<span style="font-weight: normal">
	the review process I learned that</span><span style="font-weight: normal">
	the concept of a community foundation was significantly different
	from other charitable organizations.  The distinguishing features of
	community foundations include the following</span></p>
	<p align="justify"><span style="font-weight: normal">-focus
	on endowments with restricted use of the principal; </span>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><span style="font-weight: normal">-gifts
	accepted according to a common set of conditions; </span>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><span style="font-weight: normal">-distribution
	of funds is the sole responsibility of a governing body; </span>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><span style="font-weight: normal">-the
	use of funds could be changed by the governing body when
	circumstances made the original conditions impractical, undesirable,
	unnecessary or impossible; </span>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><span style="font-weight: normal">-funds
	were intended to serve the community and there would be an annual
	public report.</span></p>
	<p align="justify" style="font-weight: normal"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">Definition:
	<span style="font-weight: normal">A
	community foundations is a non-governmental, non-profit organization
	with funds and programs managed by its own trustees or directors,
	established to maintain or aid social, educational, charitable,
	religious or other activities serving the common welfare primarily
	through making grants</span><span style="font-weight: normal">.</span></p>
	<p align="justify" style="font-weight: normal"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">Statistics<span style="font-weight: normal">
	show the first community foundation was established in Cleveland,
	Ohio in 1914 and the first </span>
	</p>
	<p align="justify" style="font-weight: normal">community
	foundation was established in Canada in Winnipeg in 1921.  Today
	there are 160 community 
	</p>
	<p align="justify" style="font-weight: normal">foundations
	in Canada and the movement has extended around the world.</p>
	<p align="justify" style="font-weight: normal"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">The
	Glendenning <span style="font-weight: normal">report
	concluded that t</span><span style="font-weight: normal">here
	was a niche, such a foundation should serve all PEI and the key to
	success would be a highly respected Board.  </span>
	</p>
	<p align="justify" style="font-weight: normal"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">The
	Report <span style="font-weight: normal">recommended
	that the idea be implemented, a nominating committee be struck to
	include the Mayors of Charlottetown and Summerside, the Chair of the
	United Way, and the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of PEI; an
	interim Board of five community leaders be approached; start-up
	funds be solicited, and the services of a part-time Executive
	Director be solicited.</span></p>
	<p align="justify" style="font-weight: normal"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">The
	Nominating Committee<span style="font-weight: normal">
	included Chief Justice Norman Carruthers as Chair, Mayor Jack Ready
	and Mayor Basil Stewart. (The latter invited Paul H. Schurman to act
	on his behalf)  </span>
	</p>
	<p align="justify" style="font-weight: normal"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify"><span style="font-weight: normal">The
	Community Foundation of Prince Edward Island was incorporated in
	January, 1993 and included Tom Davies as Chair, Mary Wilcox as
	Secretary, Stan McPherson as Treasurer and Paul Schurman as Vice
	Chair; other members included Don Glendenning, Aquinas Ryan, Connie
	Ings, Herb Leavitt, Dr. Ulric Poirier and Peggy Coady.</span></p>
