<p><b>Education – any experience that has a formative effect on the way a person thinks, feels or acts</b></p>

<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>EDUCATION</b></p>
<p><b>Our futures and the future of our community will depend in large measure on the nature and level of education gained by our citizens. Provinces have a responsibility to help their citizens develop attitudes, skills and knowledge at least to the level of good citizenship;<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Provinces also have a responsibility to ensure that their communities have the skilled people, including skills in math,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>needed to care for the community in which they live. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A 2003 multi-country study by the European Commission found that, if the national average educational attain-ment level is increased by a single year, aggregate productivity increases by 6.2 per cent right away and by a further 3.1 per cent in the long run.</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Education is offered through a public-school system devoted to serving the needs of young people, a number of relatively autonomous postsecondary institutions, the private sector and a conglomeration of services operated or administered through provincial ministries of learning, training and workforce development (much of the latter is paid for by federal dollars).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Public and media comment sugges, hover, gap however, between what education offers and what the community expects.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The Council of Ministers of Education Canada (CMEC) highlighted this concern in its statement of July 6. 2016 when it said the need to improve transition is shared by many educators, employers, certification agencies and the community at large.</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>MATHEMATICS EDUCATION<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b>The application of mathematics to every day life is considered essential in every day life and, for the most part, is organized around the conventional structure of mathematics: arithmetic, algebra, geometry, trigonometry, calculus, probability and statistics.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The goal for students of PEI Grade 9 mathematics is to “become mathematically literate adults”.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is an achievable goal, at least for most students but, if math test scores and public comment are used as the measure, the goal remains a challenge rather than an accomplishment. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b>Providers who deliver math services to school-age youth; follow a curriculum approved by the Department of Education based on a Curriculum Based Outcomes model.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Other providers base math instruction on a variety of sources.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>On the other side of the coin, “receivers” of students have a variety of math interests and needs not always well- documented. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>The writer’s exploration of math education on PEI suggests the following issues: <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b>Communication, coordination, collaboration<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b>Social capital building in the math community.</b></p>

<p><b>THE MATTER OF RELEVANCE</b></p>
<p><b>Recent explorrtion of math led me to the numeracy, which has been described as “having the confidence and skill to use numbers and mathematical approaches in all aspects of life - at work, in pact frequently ictal everyday activities at home and beyond, as consumers, in managing our finances, as parents helping our children learn, as patients making sense of health information, as citizens understanding the world about us.”. A report by the PEI Department of Education on </b><span><b>The Early Numeracy Intervention Program (ENIP) which found that numeracy </b><b><i>“gives students the tools and the skills to solve problems logically, and to developmental flexibility, independence of thought, self-efficacy, and the ability to persevere”</i></b></span><b> According to the Conference Board of Canada, “</b><span><b><i>Overall, Canada earns a “C” grade on inadequate numeracy skills."</i></b></span></p>
<p><b><i></i></b><br></p>
<p><b>The literature shows growing support for instruction in numeracy; some teachers teach it directly while others support numeracy through on-line courses. Most seem to consider numeracy as an additional offering and not a replacement course.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The National Numeracy Organization (UK)proposes:</b></p>
<p><b>Every teacher become a teacher of numeracy.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That does not mean that every teacher becomes a maths teacher but that numeracy, just like literacy- is recognized as an intrinsic part of every subject across the school curriculum.</b></p>
<p><b>A new measure of numeracy proficiency should be introduced for all young people at the age of 14.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This would establish a national benchmark for the level of numeracy needed for further study in all subjects between the ages of 14-19</b></p>
<p><b>An additional and universally respected qualification in numeracy (or core maths) is needed alongside GGCSE maths.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Politicians and curriculum and qualifications regulators must give serious and urgent consideration and introduction of dual GCSSEs in maths and numeracy</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Strangely, there appears o be no standard list of numeracies, competencies, skills or outcomes. or even division or categories of numeracies. Alberta, for example identifies two categories:<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>skills,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b>!} Quantitative information which can be measured and expressed as an amount – numbers, patterns <span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>statistics and probability, and</b></p>
<p><b>(2) Spatial information - physical location of objects or people to the relationships between objects or peon<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>plea – measures, location, direction, shape and space</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>However, from my review, the following appear as typical:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b>•	Estimating and calculating with whole numbers<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b>•	Counting and grouping<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b>•	Recognizing and using patterns and relationship <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b>•	Using fractions, decimals, percentages, ratios and rates</b></p>
<p><b>•	Using spatial reasoning</b></p>
<p><b>•	Interpreting statistical information</b></p>
<p><b>•	Using measurement</b></p>
<p><b>•	Managing money</b></p>
<p><b>•	Managing time</b></p>
<p><b>•	Dealing with chance and uncertainty</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>COMMON NUMERACY MAP</b></p>
<p><b>Differences between a math analysis and<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>numeracy analysis:</b></p>
<p><b>Described in user language</b></p>
<p><b>Organized around users practices</b></p>
<p><b>Numeracy= survey of applications by users</b></p>
<p><b>Intended<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>for use by learners</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Whereas, the writer found a number of analyses of competencies and /or outcomes used as a basis for curriculum in traditional mathematics, they do not lend themselves as a basis for identifying numeracies. , It appears, that hey result from a further analysis of traditional math whereas literacy skills on the other hand, are identified through a structured survey of typical users.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Given the above, it makes sense to develop a common numeracy map for use in the PEI education system.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As a minimum, it will provide an opportunity to compare the two</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A numeracy map would serve as a common base for users and providers of math services, students, parents, teachers, program planning, student career planning, interagency discussion, performance standards, student tracking, curriculum Development, employment and tutoring, student record keeping, employer hiring, setting entrance requirements. Industry surveys, employer associations, gap analysis, certification, staffing etc.</b></p>
