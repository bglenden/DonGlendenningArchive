  CFPEI tribute to Robinson
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">A tribute to John Robinson celebrating his leadership of the Community Foundation of PEI, which grew assets from $1 million to $7 million under his direction. Don credits Robinson&#x27;s vision of the Foundation as key provincial infrastructure and praises his engagement of summer residents and development of investment policies. The tribute exemplifies Don&#x27;s role as a mentor to community leaders.</div>

<p>:</p>
<p>John Robinson</p>
<p>John Robinson first came to my attention during a conversation with Tom Davies, then President of the Community Foundation, as a possible board member and future president. Tom was right; John was<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>both of these <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>and more and became a driving force behind the Community Foundation of Prince Edward Island. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>I’ve known John for 20 years, first as a successful Island business man and entrepreneur, a man, well known in the agriculture industry for progressive farming practices, leadership in the sector and stewardship of the land.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>While his business was farming, his interests included the agricultural sector and the Island as a whole.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The Robinson family was, and still is, active in their church, supporters of community organizations and events, and play leadership roles in many areas especially in supporting arts and culture.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>John was elected Director of the Community Foundation of Prince Edward Island in 1999 and soon adopted a proprietary interest in its future, served wherever help was needed, including three terms as President.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In the early years of the Foundation, John led the Foundation in the establishment of sound investment policies and business practices.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>John recognized PEI summer visitors as significant contributors to PEI life, especially to our arts and culture, and took steps to engage them in summer activities, most notably a reception on July 4 for US visitors and a summer lecture series so that guests could get to know the Island he loved.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Not surprising, John also registered the Community Foundation with the US internal Revenue Service so that US donors to island charitable causes could claim donations to the Foundation on their US income tax returns</p>
<p>John is currently leading the Foundation efforts in the area of development; he sees the Foundation as a key component of the provinces infrastructure, a component committed to building a pool of funds to be available in perpetuity for the betterment of the Island community – and he is having<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>considerable success.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Under his direction, and thanks to his energy and leadership, Foundation assets grew from under one to over seven million dollars – and he has visions for continuing growth.</p>
<p>In addition to the above, John has an unusually high commitment to the cause of community foundations, is a fine person, a respected member of the community, a world traveler, a gracious host, a beloved father and grandfather, and a good friend.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I can think of no better person to epitomize the concept of a smart and caring community</p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Donald Glendenning<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>C.M.</p>
