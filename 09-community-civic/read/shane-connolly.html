<div class="reader-summary">Letter from Don Glendenning to Shayne Connolly, President of ADVOCIS (financial advisors), dated June (year not specified but context suggests 2004-2005). Don educates about community foundations as &quot;new breed&quot; of charitable organization, community-based rather than cause-based, increasingly chosen as legacy vehicle. Lists seven key reasons to use CFPEIs: continuity, transparency/accountability, low administration fees (1%), professional investment service, principal maintenance, adaptability, and flexibility. Emphasizes CFPEI scholarship flexibility (follows students between institutions, on/off island). Discusses customized granting programs matching donor interests. Positions CFPEI as best vehicle for creating lasting donor legacies. Reflects Don&#x27;s sophisticated understanding of competitive fundraising landscape and professional relationship development with financial planners.</div>

<p><br></p>
<p>Dear Shayne:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>This is a follow-up to our telephone conversation of Friday, June 3.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>As you know, community foundations are a new breed of charitable organization in Canada in that they are community based rather than cause based, and focus on carrying out a donor’s wishes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Increasingly community foundations are becoming the vehicle of choice for people who wish to customize their legacies in the form of endowments.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Reasons why a donor should consider a community foundation are many including:</p>
<p>Continuity</p>
<p>Transparency and accountability</p>
<p>Low administration fee</p>
<p>Professional investment service</p>
<p>Maintenance of principal</p>
<p>Adaptive to changing circumstances</p>
<p>Flexibility</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>We learn each day of the many existing endowments languishing from inattention.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Placing an endowment with CFPEI ensures that will not happen.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>In the matter of scholarships, a community foundation based scholarship may be awarded to any student regardless of the institution chosen and, in fact, can follow a student from one institution to another on or off the Island.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Many donors have been active in their communities in a number of ways including making donations to their favourite charities; a community foundation can continue to make grants on their behalf in future years.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Other donors have interests that may not match mandates of existing organizations; a community foundation can develop a customized granting program to match those interests.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And in both cases, the interests guide granting decisions forever. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Because of our breadth of focus and Island-wide mandate, CFPEI is likely to be able to assist a donor in identifying community needs and designing an award to fit their interest.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Attention to donor wishes is provided in perpetuity and this service is provided at the ridiculously low administration fee rate of one percent of principal each year.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>We have embarked upon a more active role in informing professionals who advise donors of the services available through CFPEI and would welcome an opportunity to discuss these services with you, and through you, to make our services known to others in the field. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>After you have an opportunity to look over the enclosed material, I will give you a call to arrange to discuss the matter further.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Thanks again for<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>your interest.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Don Glendenning</p>
