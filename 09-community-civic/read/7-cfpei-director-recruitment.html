  7 CFPEI Director Recruitment
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Strategic proposal by Don advocating for establishment of an external board recruitment committee chaired by the Lieutenant Governor, similar to models used by other foundations (Fundy, Nova Scotia Community Foundation). References Don&#x27;s Order of Canada status (&quot;Member of the Order of Canada&quot;) as criterion for committee membership. Argues this approach would elevate governance standards and restore CFPEI to &quot;original roots&quot; by recruiting high-profile community leaders. Demonstrates Don&#x27;s vision for professional governance structures and his understanding of institutional best practices.</div>

<p><b>RECRUITMENT OF DIRECTORS</b></p>
<p><b>Proposal: </b>To strike an external committee for purpose of recruiting new Directors.</p>
<p><b>Background:</b></p>
<p>Community foundations thrive on their support by and service to their communities.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>One of the devices used to maintain that linkage is the use of external nominating committees.</p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li3">The initial Directors were recruited by a Committee Chaired by the Chief Justice and included the Mayor of Summerside and the Mayor of Charlottetown.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Over time, the composition changed and included the Chief Justice as chair but included the President of the PEI Federation of Municipalities. The current nominating Committee is chaired by a Past President and included the current President and a member from the community.</li>
  <li class="li3">Fundy Foundation has a board <span>Recruitment Committee</span> consisting of six members including two current directors; the chair of the committee is external.  Membership includes representatives from the Islands and maybe other outlying districts.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In addition, the Fundy Foundation created a panel of advisors, a group of prominent citizens, on whom they may call from time to time for advice on new directions or major initiatives.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Their role is not specified but my discussion with the Exec Dir. suggests that they are well respected citizens whose opinions are value when setting new directions.</li>
  <li class="li3">For many years the Mayor of |Moncton chaired the nominating committee of the Moncton Foundation – and he may still do so</li>
  <li class="li4">The members of the Board of Directors of the Nova Scotia Community Foundation are appointed by a Committee, consisting of the Lieutenant Governor of Nova Scotia, the Chief Justice of the Trial Division of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, the Mayor of the Halifax Regional Municipality, the Deputy Attorney General of Nova Scotia, and the President of the Metropolitan Halifax Chamber of Commerce</li>
  <li class="li4">I believe that it is time to return to our roots<span>  </span></li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Proposal:</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li3">To invite the following to constitute a Board Recruitment Committee:</li>
</ul>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li3">Lieutenant Governor, Chair</li>
  <li class="li3">Member of the Order of Canada <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li3">Immediate Past President of CFPEI</li>
</ul>
