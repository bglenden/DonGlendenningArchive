<div class="reader-summary">Personal letter from Jim Stavert responding to inquiries about Hall and Stavert foundry castings. Jim notes his father and Harold Hall founded the foundry in 1933, castings were likely from 1940, and expresses interest in returning castings to PEI. The letter illustrates connections discovered during the agricultural heritage research initiative.</div>

<p>Dear Mr. Heim:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I was delighted with your telephone call about the Hall and Stavert casting in your possession.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Please excuse the delay in getting back to you. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>As I mentioned, my father and Harold Hall went into the foundry business together in 1933.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The castings in your possession would have been one of their items but I do not know how many would have been cast. Hall and Stavert is still operating but now we produce mostly marine propellers. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The wheels, we think, would have been cast about 1940.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We certainly do not have any original casting is and I am not aware of any in our local museums but I do not know for sure.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>One wonders how such an item ever reached Illinois.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I do not recall just how many of the Hall and Stavert castings you have in your possession, but if more than one, I and am wondering if you would have any interest in seeing one or more of the castings returned to PEI.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Thanks again for getting in touch.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Compliments of the season.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Jim Stavert</p>
