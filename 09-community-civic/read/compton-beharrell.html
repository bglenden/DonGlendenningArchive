<p>Cindy Beharrell</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Dear Cindy:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I write, Cindy, to introduce the Community Foundation of Prince Edward Island and to offer our services should you be thinking of establishing a memorial in your Dad’s memory.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Your Dad was aware of the work of the foundation and made a contribution to one of our early initiatives.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>First some comments about community foundations in general and the Community Foundation of Prince Edward Island in particular.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Community foundations, and there are 170 in Canada today, create and administer permanent endowments for charitable purposes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The goal is to improve the lives of individuals and their communities.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This is accomplished by making grants for the purposes, and only the purposes, designated by individual donors. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Funds from donors are pooled and invested in perpetuity; earnings are used to make grants. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The Community Foundation of Prince Edward Island serves the entire Province, is governed by a volunteer board widely representative of Island life, maintains an office in Charlottetown, has assets approaching $1.5 million, makes grants annually in excess of $50,000, is being used increasingly by Islanders to host their charitable legacies, is registered with both the Canada Revenue<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Agency and the IRS,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>is transparent and open while following sound business practices.</p>
<p>Investments are professionally managed, books are audited annually and reports are public.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Although one of the newer community foundations in Canada, we are well experienced in creating and administering  endowments (over 60 at the moment) for the<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>benefit of Island organizations and individuals. .</p>
<p>Historically, donors made separate donations to each organization they wanted to support; unfortunately, that approach results in the legacy being dispersed; in addition, not all charitable organizations are in a position to handle endowments effectively.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The alternative is to place one’s charitable legacy with a community foundation, thereby keeping the legacy intact and flowing grants to the individual charities of interest on a regular basis and in perpetuity.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is the latter approach that we recommend and the one increasingly being chosen when establishing legacy funds. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The establishment of a fund with CFPEI is quite simple; it involves a one page agreement setting out the name and purpose of the fund together with the names of the causes or organizations to which grants are to be made.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In the case of your Dad, interests could include his church, Camp Gencheff, the Bangor cemetery, or any number of other causes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Should your interest be in a capital project, we could be of assistance also.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I am enclosing information about the Community Foundation of Prince Edward Island; should you have any questions, please do not hesitate to get in touch.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If you think it useful to discuss ideas and options, whether or not they include the Community Foundation, do not hesitate to call.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Whatever your decision, please know that I am willing to help in any way that I can.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I must tell you that my recent visit to Fox Meadow, my first since Simon died, brought back many memories and emotions of our friendship generally, but especially about the years<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>that we lived in the same Park in Mesa.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>While at the Clubhouse, it was nice to have a conversation with Trudy, brief and all as it was.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We looked for Paul but he was not working that day.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>My warmest wishes to all the family.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Don Glendenning,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Director</p>
