<p>CF2.2.1.2</p>
<p><b>BOARD RESTRUCTURING</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>As part of our plan to grow the Foundation, we need a strategic plan for recruitment, development and recognition of directors and committee members.  The first step, obviously, is to clarify our longer term vision of the Foundation.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>While we accomplish much of that through building of endowments, our inroads into the community will come through service.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>We are moving, I would say have moved, from a Level 1 community foundation to level two and have our vision set on a level three.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We should begin now to make appointments that reflect that vision.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Given your work on behalf of the Foundation, a level three operation is in sight. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Beyond that, I am of the view that CFPEI has the potential to be the most significant player in the third sector of PEI and we need to begin positioning ourselves now for that eventuality.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>To that end, I have been exploring that idea informally with a number of community leaders.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I would hope that later this spring, or at the latest early next fall, to convene a few people for the purpose of exploring this idea collectively. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I have been thinking about the future of CFPEI, browsing some foundation websites and reflecting on our own operation and various discussions.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Here are some ideas for your consideration<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Board Recruitment.</b><b></b></p>
<p>     </p>
<p>Fundy Foundation has a board Recruitment Committee consisting of six members including two current directors; the chair of that committee is external.  Both Moncton and the Nova Community Foundation, I believe, still have external nominating committees.  Such an approach, I believe, keeps the "ownership" with the community.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>If this is of interest, one approach would be to establish a three person committee consisting of (1) a recent appointee to the Order of Canada and (2) a recent appointee to the Order of PEI and (3) a member of the Board.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I like the idea of an external chair although I realize that having a board member as chair is more efficient.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>By January 1 each year, the Board Chair would meet with the committee and:</p>
<p>list of Board vacancies<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Brief the committee on the kind of strengths needed</p>
<p>Long range goals of the organization, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Other relevant matters</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The Recruitment Committee will:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Seek out potential appointees,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Conduct initial interviews</p>
<p>Present candidates at annual meeting</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>As far as criteria for Board appointments, I suggest that we select people who are willing and able to chair a committee, have the potential to be president.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The average of our Directors should to be lowered and gender needs to be balanced.</p>
<p>At time of recruitment, Directors should be made aware of expectations and terms of reference.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There should also be a formal orientation for Directors when they are appointed.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Committees</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Committees should serve as both a significant source and important training ground of new Directors:</p>
<p>All appointments of Committee members should be approved by the Board.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>While the chair can and should have a major role in selection, the President may have additional reasons for make appointments.</p>
<p>Appointments should be for a single term of three years with eligibility for reappointment after a one-year break; as part of the grooming process, people may be appointed to other committees</p>
<p>Terms should be acknowledged in writing. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The rotation of directors among committees is encouraged.</p>
<p>Normally, the President would be expected to have served, and perhaps chaired, one or more committees</p>
<p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>An informal but structured orientation session should be held for both Board and Committee members sometime after the annual meeting and before their first working meeting</p>
<p>Every committee, except the Executive committee, should have community members.</p>
<p>Committee appointments is a good wasy to broaden our bsse so that it refl3ectrs visible and other minorities<span>. </span></p>
<p><b>Special Projects</b><span><b> </b></span></p>
<p>Service to the community is more important, I believe, than we assign it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There is a tremendous opportunity and value in undertaking special initiatives, many of which could be self supporting. We have, for example YIP, community building, cemetery workshop, US Day, vital signs     (although not this year) and, I am sure, others will arise.  </p>
<p>At one time we had a special-projects or special-initiatives committee, but that fell by the wayside.  I think it should be resurrected. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The Fundy Community Foundation assigns a special initiatives function to a Granting and Program Committee.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It could, however, also be attached to the development or marketing committee. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>In the longer run, that thespecial initiatives function is important warrants a separate committee.</p>
<p>Some, perhaps all, of our initiatives could benefit from outside advice even in the planning stage.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>For example, perhaps we should put in place now a small g committee (three people?) who will lead the planning and eventual implementation of the vital signs initiative.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><b>Development<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p>More resources need to be assigned to the development function:</p>
<p>We would likely all agree that development should focus on the building of endowments; a position with which I agree</p>
<p>Perhaps asset development is a more appropriate name</p>
<p>To reach our objectives, however, we need to look for more sponsorships and general contributions towards operating costs.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I am also convinced that there is money available for special projects if we could tap it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>John’s lead in “Quantum Leap” is an example.</p>
<p>Perhaps sponsorships and operational support should be part of the responsibility of the executive, or the special projects committee referred to above?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Or??? But it needs to be somewhere.</p>
<p>Willingness to solicit funds should be a condition of membership</p>
<p>We should also add a professional fund raiser to the development committee.</p>
<p><b>Advisors</b><b></b></p>
<p>From time to time it may be useful to have access to the advice of prominent citizens on new directions or major initiatives.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>At one time we talked about a loose association of former directors. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Fundy Foundation accomplishes this through a group of seven advisors.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There role seems not well specified but my discussion with the Exec Dir. suggests that they are well respected citizens whose opinion is valuable.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Having such a group also adds credibility..</p>
<p>Given our informal discussion about the long, long term future of CFPEI, I think that such a group may be useful.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The number of advisors should be small and carefully chosen.</p>
<p>Such a group would very seldom be involved in a current decision making but, perhaps, would meet one a year over dinner to be briefed and to offer advice on matters of import to CFPEI<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>and the island</p>
