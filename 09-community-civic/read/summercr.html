the preservation of heritage and urban planning to the City of
Charlottetown (into the future).  The Community Foundation will award
grants from the fund in  support Catherine’s  charitable interests 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in; text-indent: 0.5in">Initial
donations were made through a fundraising dinner held at the Delta on
May 14<sup>th</sup>,
2010.      The dinner was a great success with nearly (1000?) people
in attendance;  proceeds from tickets sales and a silent auction
created the basis for the Catherine G. Hennessey Endowment Fund.  In
weeks since the dinner, donations and well wishes continue to come
in.  The Community Foundation looks forward to working with both the
City of Charlottetown and Catherine as the fund continues to grow.

aspect of the Community Foundation that is very important to us is
that we are capable of providing grants and special awards in support
of social, educational, cultural and other services.   For 2010, the
Community Foundation is directing its grant giving activity toward
organizations providing services and support to seniors and their
families.   Proposals were invited from community based, non-profit
organizations that assist in education, nutrition, and health and
well being of seniors and families of seniors.  The CFPEI granting
committee would like to thank all those who applied for grants in
support of seniors.  If you would like some more information on our
granting activity feel free to contact us.</p>

		Life
	insurance allows donors to make extraordinary gifts at manageable
	costs.  Life Insurance proceeds are not subject to probate nor do
	they reduce the value of other assets, so there are no negative
	implications for the estate.  A donor's decision concerning the

	<b>	</b>A
	very straightforward way of making a gift to The Foundation is by
	way of cash or cheque.  There is immediate benefit to The Foundation
	while the donor receives a receipt.  The receipt will permit donors
	to obtain a tax credit to 75% limit of net income.  Donations that
	exceed the 75% threshold can be used over the next five years. 
	Donation receipts can also be saved for up to five years and then
	used all at once.  Corporate donors obtain a tax deduction.</p>
	<p style="orphans: 0; widows: 0; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
		</p>
	<p style="orphans: 0; text-indent: 0.5in; widows: 0; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
	There
	is a significant incentive for taxpayers to donate publicly listed
	securities.  Gifting appreciated securities enable the donor to give
	the most to The Foundation for the least cost.  In the 2000 Federal
	Budget the taxable gain on gifted securities was halved from 50% to
	25%.  A receipt is given for the market value of the securities on
	the transfer date to The Foundation.  Appreciated securities can be
	shares, bonds, warrants, stocks etc.</p>

	<b>	</b>Wills
	are a popular vehicle for donors to make charitable gifts.  A
	charitable donation made at death is subject to a 100% of income
	limit, which can go back for one year.  A donor's charitable
	intention may be included in a Will.  The distribution of the funds
	may be filed with The Community Foundation of PEI and may be changed
	at any time without amending the Will.</p>
