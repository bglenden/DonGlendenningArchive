<p>Mr. Cyril Chapman</p>
<p>Chapman Brothers Construction Ltd.</p>
<p>P.O. Box 85</p>
<p>Souris, Prince Edward Island</p>
<p>C0A 2B0</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Dear Mr. Chapman,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>This letter comes to introduce you to the Community Foundation of Prince Edward Island and to seek an opportunity to discuss the services we offer.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You may be aware of the Foundation as we have been making grants to organizations in the Souris area for a number of years.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Also, Margaret Ching is a past Director, Carol Fraser is a current Director and John and Pam MacDonald are very much aware of our activities and it was they who suggested that you may be interested in learning more about us.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Most people support a number of charitable organizations and activities.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When it comes to their charitable legacy, however, more and more are choosing their local community foundation; they do so for the following reasons:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Community foundations, focus on the long-term future of their communities, engage in the building of endowments and allow donors to keep their charitable funds intact enabling them to support the causes and organizations of their choice.</p>
<p>Community foundations have a community orientation rather than a focus on a single charitable issue. Their goal is to improve the lives of individuals and their communities.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This is accomplished by making grants for the purposes, and only the purposes, designated by individual donors. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This results in increasing the value of their contributions to community causes.</p>
<p>Community foundations allow us to keep our charitable legacy in a single location thereby keeping the legacy intact and flowing grants to the individual charities of interest on a regular basis and in perpetuity.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Traditionally, donors make separate donations to each organization they wish to support; unfortunately, that approach results in the legacy being dispersed; in addition, not all charitable organizations are in a position to handle endowments effectively.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is the latter approach that we recommend and the one increasingly being chosen when establishing legacy funds. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The Community Foundation of Prince Edward Island serves the entire Province, is governed by a volunteer board widely representative of Island life, has assets approaching $1.5 million, is registered with both the Canada Revenue Agency and the IRS, and is transparent and open while following sound business practices. Although one of the newer community foundations in Canada, CFPEI is well experienced in creating endowment and distribution plans for the benefit of Island organizations and individuals.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>At our most recent awards night, the Community Foundation of Prince Edward Island announced nearly $70,000 in awards and grants including 5 scholarships, books for school libraries, a project to support seniors, leadership training for the boys and girls Club and through the Souris Community Fund a grant of $1000 was made to the Souris Fire Fighters Association.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>This letter does not come with a request for support for a particular cause or organization.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Instead, it comes with an offer, an offer to assist you to design a charitable legacy that reflects both your interests and resources – a free offer with no actual or implied commitment.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I am enclosing information about the Community Foundation of Prince Edward Island; should you have any questions, please do not hesitate to get in touch.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In any case, I expect to be in Souris later this month and will be in touch to see if we can meet.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
