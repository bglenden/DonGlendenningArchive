<div class="reader-summary">Letter from Don Glendenning to Harry Holman dated March 6, 2009, written from Florida detailing the development of the &quot;Leave a Legacy&quot; arts brochure. Don explains he earmarked private donations to extend the Island Arts and Heritage Stabilization Project (IAHSP) impact. Scott MacAuley proposed a multi-panel brochure featuring six organizations plus front/back matter. Five organizations responded positively; Carrefour initially didn&#x27;t participate but Michelle Blanchard later responded with French panel. Don discusses unsuccessful attempts to fund French translation (estimated $800-1,000 plus printing costs). Explains Carrefour wouldn&#x27;t participate in English-only version with French panel. References Donald Arsenault (past CFPEI Director) and seeks advice from Harry Holman regarding translation grant opportunities.</div>

<p>Date:		March 6, 2009</p>

<p>Subject:	Arts brochure</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Greetings from the sandy shores of Florida!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I am having email problems; I can receive but not send so am handling my messages via web mail.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Some background on the arts brochure:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I felt strongly that we should try to extend the impact of the IAHSP project and was able to earmark some private donations to CFPEI for that purpose.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The funds are not part of the funds transferred to CFPEI on wind-up of IAHSP.</p>
<p>I approached the six original organizations for ideas; I had in mind a workshop with an outside resource person.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There was little interest but Scott MacAuley proposed a “Leave a Legacy” brochure with each organization having its own panel – six organizations plus a front and back panel would make eight panels.</p>
<p>The original six were canvassed and five responded early and positively.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Panels were developed and edited a number of times.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We also met once in Summerside.</p>
<p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>did not show any interest although I included them on the mailing list.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Sometime in January, after Michelle Blanchard returned to her post, she responded indicating an interest and Michelle send me a panel in French.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She thought that she might be able to find funds for a printing in French as well.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She was not successful.</p>
<p>I talked with John Robinson, CFPEI President, and we were delighted with the idea of publishing the brochure in both languages but we did not have the money to do so. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>I obtained estimates from Quik Kopy and John Arenburg for printing and design.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>After receiving the panel in French, I checked on translation services for that panel and received an estimate from Latin Access $90 plus GST or 48 cents per word. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I now understand that there is a flat fee plus a “per word” fee and the rate per word may be less for the full document.</p>
<p>Estimating 1600 words for the final brochure would mean a translation cost of $800 plus tax plus the translation of one panel from French to English would come to about $1,000.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is way out beyond our capability even if we cut the number of brochures to a minimum.</p>
<p>I met with Michelle prior to leaving for Florida and she confirmed that she had not found funds for translation, that Carrefour would not participate in an English only version (with a French panel).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I told her that we did not have funds for a brochure in both languages even if we reduced the number of brochures being printed.</p>
<p>I had tried to reach Donald Arsenault prior to visiting Carrefour but he was not available; Donald is a past Director of CFPEI and I thought that he might have some advice.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He returned my call after my visit to Carrefour and I explained the project and our dilemma.</p>
<p>While in transit, I received an Email from Donald suggesting that I get in touch with you.</p>
<p>At this point, other than money, the only issue that I am uncertain about is how to accommodate the additional words resulting from translating into the French language</p>
<p>I assume that Donald sent a copy of the draft brochure but, if not, please let me know and I will forward a copy.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Please let me know what documentation you need or steps to be taken to apply for a grant for purposes of translation.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Regards</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Don</p>
