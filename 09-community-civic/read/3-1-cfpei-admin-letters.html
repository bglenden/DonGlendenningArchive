<p>February 19, 2012</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Mr. John Robinson, President</p>
<p>Community Foundation of Prince Edward Island</p>
<p>119-121 Queen St.</p>
<p>Charlottetown, PE<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>C1A 4B3<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Dear Mr. Robinson:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span>PEI Education Group</span></p>
<p>.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>As a result of considerable discussion over the past year, a small group of people with an interest in education, has come together to discuss educational issues.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Members are unanimous in the view that there is a need in PEI, and across the country, for greater public engagement in education at all levels.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The group, known informally as the PEI Education Group, met recently and is beginning the process of forming an organization.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A copy of the discussion paper, still a draft, is attached.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Our plan is to proceed with incorporation and eventually to obtaining a registration number with CRA.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In the interim, we are interested in using the good offices of CFPEI to handle any financial transactions including:</p>
<p><br></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li1"><b>Operating funds</b> - cash donations to offset start-up and normal administrative expenses. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li1"><b>Program and project funds –</b> donations and sponsorships in support of program activities such as gathering and disseminating information, convening<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>public presentations and conversations, workshops, etc</li>
  <li class="li1"><b>Endowment Funds </b>– from which income would be available to support any and all activities of the organization.<b> <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></li>
</ul>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>We believe that increasing public engagement in education will have a significant and long term impact on education of Islanders, young and old, and on Island communities.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A linkage with CFPEI would, we believe, would allow an earlier start-up and would also strengthen our hand as we seek funds. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>We also have other partnership ideas but that will be the subject of separate discussions..</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Thank you in advance for your consideration.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Should you require additional information do not hesitate to contact me.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Don Glendenning</p>
<p>Acting Chair.</p>
