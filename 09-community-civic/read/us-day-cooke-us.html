  US Day - Cooke US
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">This letter from Don to Harry McLellan at Cooke Insurance invites sponsorship of CFPEI&#x27;s annual US Day Reception for American citizens (summer residents and year-round inhabitants). The reception, held July 4th for five years, provides informal gathering with light food, cash bar, speakers, national anthems, and US flags, typically attracting 75-125 people. Guest speakers have included the US Consul General from Halifax. The letter solicits $250 sponsorship to support the event. This initiative demonstrates Don&#x27;s strategic recognition of summer residents&#x27; charitable interest and his ability to design engaging programs building community bonds and foundation awareness among affluent US citizens.</div>

<p>Dear Harry,</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Thanks for seeing me on Thursday.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Given that I had left my file in the car, I decided to follow up with this note.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The Community Foundation of Prince Edward Island (CFPEI) is a volunteer driven, registered, non-profit, charitable organization.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Our mission is to improve the quality of life on PEI through the creation and building of endowment trust funds that will enhance life for all residents. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The Foundation provides an established means for individuals, families, community groups, corporations, and private foundations to support philanthropic activities which invest in sustainable solutions to community needs.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We connect caring people and worthy causes through endowment building.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>For the past five years, CFPEI has organized a reception on July 4<sup>th</sup> for “Summer Islanders” who are US citizens.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The purpose is to give US citizens a venue to meet and celebrate their national day, to thank them for their contributions to our community and to keep them informed about the work of the Community Foundation.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The gathering is informal, with a cash bar, light food, a speaker, our national anthems, US flags and background music.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>On three occasions, the US consul General from Halifax has joined us for the occasion.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Attendees are mostly US citizens with summer homes or who live here year round and contribute in so many ways to our Island life and Island economy.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Numbers usually range from 75 to 125 people.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>By means of this letter I am inviting Cooke Insurance to become a sponsor at the $250 level.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The enclosed information will provide background on both the Community Foundation of Prince Edward Island and the annual US citizen’s Day reception.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I’ll phone you next week to see if you have any questions about the foundation or the Reception.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>We thank you for your consideration.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
