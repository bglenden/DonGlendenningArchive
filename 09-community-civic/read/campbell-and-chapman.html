<p><br></p>
<p>Dear…</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>This letter comes to introduce you to the Community Foundation of Prince Edward Island and to seek an opportunity to discuss the services we offer.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>While the Foundation may not be well-known, we have been making grants to organizations in the Souris area for a number of years. Margaret Ching is a past Director, Carol Fraser is a current Director and John and Pam<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>MacDonald are very much aware of our activities. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Most people support a number of charitable organizations and activities.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When it comes their charitable legacy, however, more and more are choosing their local community foundation; they do so for the following reasons:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Community foundations, focus on the long-term future of their communities, engage in the building of endowments and allow donors to keep their charitable funds intact enabling them to support the causes and organizations of their choice.</p>
<p>Community foundations have a community orientation rather than a focus on a single charitable issue.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Their goal is to improve the lives of individuals and their communities.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This is accomplished by making grants for the purposes, and only the purposes, designated by individual donors.<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>This results in increasing the value of their contributions to community causes.</p>
<p>Community foundations allow us to keep our charitable legacy in a single location thereby keeping the legacy intact and flowing grants to the individual charities of interest on a regular basis and in perpetuity..<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Traditionally, donors make separate donations to each organization they wish to support; unfortunately, that approach results in the legacy being dispersed; in addition, not all charitable organizations are in a position to handle endowments effectively. It is the latter approach that we recommend and the one increasingly being chosen when establishing legacy funds. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Community foundations<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>are charitable organizations administered by a group of respected local volunteers whose main interest is in the betterment of the community.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>While investment experience is<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>important, community foundations gain access through a competitive bidding process among investment managers.</p>
<p>Although one of the newer community foundations in Canada, CFPEI is well experienced in creating endowment and distribution plans for the<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>benefit of Island organizations and individuals.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>(I do not have the awards program as I write this para)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>At our most recent awards night, the Community Foundation of Prince Edward Island announced nearly $70,000 in awards and grants including 5<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>scholarships, books for school libraries, a project to support seniors, leadership training for the boys and girls Club, ….</p>
<p>The Community Foundation of Prince Edward island serves the entire Province, is governed by a volunteer board widely representative of Island life, has assets approaching $1.5 million, is registered with both the Canada Revenue Agency and the IRS, is transparent and open while following sound business practices.</p>
<p>The establishment of a fund with CFPEI is quite simple; it involves a one page agreement setting out the name and purpose of the fund together with the names, causes and/or organizations to which grants are to be made.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As a matter of interest, a trend is emerging in recent discussions and that is that people are both naming organizations and causes of interest but also allowing anywhere from 2o to 30 percent of their legacy to be available for emerging and unforeseen causes.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>This letter does not come with a request for support for a particular cause or organization.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Instead, it comes with an offer, an offer to assist you to design a charitable legacy that reflects both your interests and resources – a free offer with no actual or implied commitment.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I am enclosing information about the Community Foundation of Prince Edward Island; should you have any questions, please do not hesitate to get in touch.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In any case, I expect to be in Souris later this month and will be in touch to see if we can meet.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Don Glendenning<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Director</p>
