  Invitation 2 
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">A formal invitation letter from Don Glendenning to stakeholders for the November 25, 2015 exploratory meeting on educational preparedness. Don references the CFPEI&#x27;s 2013 Vital Signs report documenting &quot;preparedness gaps&quot; and recent informal community conversations expressing ongoing public concern. The meeting, held at R. Birt and Associates, aimed to bring together key institutional players (post-secondary institutions, employers, educators, youth advocates) to examine the issue and explore improvement measures. The letter reflects Don&#x27;s collaborative leadership style and commitment to evidence-based institutional dialogue.</div>

<p><b>Invitation-2</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>This is a follow-up to my Email of October 29 with an invitation to a discussion on the issue of “preparedness” of Island youth for further education and for work.  As I pointed out, my concern is for the impact that the issue may be having on both youth and the community. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p>We will meet in the 2nd floor board room of R. Birt and Associates, 27 Brackley Point Road, Charlottetown at 9:00 am. <span>Wednesday, November 25, 2015 and<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>will end no later than 10:30.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p>I’ll be back in touch before  November 25.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Looking forward to the discussion.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Regards</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Don Glendenning</p>

<p>In late 2013, the Community Foundation of Prince Edward Island conducted a survey of some two hundred young people about the issues facing Island youth.  the report found that ""literacy and numeracy outcomes are still low, and there are 'preparedness gaps' with regard to readiness for post <br>
secondary study and the workplace."  The report, Vital Signs, is available on the Foundation's website, www.cfpei.ca; a report on a series of discussions on the report  convened by Education 20/20 Inc. is included with this invitation.  In recent weeks, I've had a number of informal conversations with Islanders and find the issue still of public concern.<br>
<br>
You are invited you to join other key players on Wednesday, November 25 to explore the issue, especially as it relates to Island youth.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
