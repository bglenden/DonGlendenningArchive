  CFPEI 73 Living Memorial
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Newsletter No. 73 from August 28, 2007, highlights the Living Memorial Trust established to honor Dr. Charles Keuper, a retired physician who worked to protect PEI&#x27;s natural beauty. The trust funds plantings at public spaces, particularly trail entrances. A notable photograph shows Elinore (Mrs. Charles) Keuper and Don Glendenning standing beside the newly planted Island oak tree at Wood Islands&#x27; Confederation Trail entrance, depicting Don&#x27;s active role in this environmental initiative. The article explains how living memorials enhance environment and wildlife habitat. Don&#x27;s prominent involvement in this community project reflects his commitment to conservation and commemorative giving.</div>

	<p>Living
	Memorial Trust Established</p>
	<p style="font-weight: normal"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="font-weight: normal">The Wood Islands
	entrance to Trails PEI looks different today, and will be
	significantly different in 20 years, thanks to the planting of two
	clusters of native red oak trees.  The planting is the first
	initiative of the Community Foundation of Prince Edward Island under
	the newly established Living Memorial Trust from which grants will
	be made for the purpose of enhancing public spaces throughout the
	Island.</p>
	<p style="font-weight: normal"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="font-weight: normal">The Living Memorial
	Trust was established through the efforts of the Keuper Family to
	remember the life of Dr. Charles Keuper, a physician who came to PEI
	in 1979 after his retirement and worked tirelessly to protect and
	enhance the Island’s natural beauty.  Dr. Charles Keuper was born
	in Schulenburg, Texas, received his higher education at Elmhurst
	College, Illinois and the University of Texas.  After a stint as a
	Medical Officer with the United States Army in Japan, Dr. Keuper
	opened a practice in Boston and taught for a number of years at
	Harvard Medical School.  Upon retirement, the Keuper family set up
	residence in Wood Islands.  
	</p>
	<p style="font-weight: normal"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="font-weight: normal">Living Memorials are
	more than just a tribute; living memorials enhance and beautify our
	environment, provide shelter for wild life, reduce erosion and
	improve the quality of the air we breathe.  Grants may be made for
	the enhancement of any public space, however, the initial focus will
	be on trail entrances.

	</p>
	<p style="font-weight: normal">Contributions to The
	Living Memorial Trust are made to mark a milestone in the life of a
	person or organization; milestones include births, deaths,
	retirements, Mother’s Day or Father’s Day, part of a family
	reunion, or simply as a thank you to a very special person.  Donors
	will be given a receipt to be used when filing Income Tax returns in
	both Canada and the USA 
	</p>
	<p style="font-weight: normal"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="font-weight: normal">General contributions
	allow for plantings in any public space, however, arrangements may
	also be made for plantings of interest to the donor and may include
	a memorial plaque.</p>
