  Literacy letter Callbeck
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">An October 26, 2009 letter from Don to Catherine Callbeck highlighting the Community Foundation&#x27;s commitment to literacy issues and proposing an initiative to convene literacy stakeholders for dialogue. Don notes that despite a year of conversations and Foundation grant-making to home literacy projects, the fundamental problem remains: literacy providers operate in isolation without coordination. He proposes funding small-scale &quot;dialogue&quot; activities (copying, mailing, meeting space) to bring stakeholders together, offering personal attention to lead the initiative. This letter exemplifies Don&#x27;s conviction that improved communication and coordination could leverage existing resources more effectively.</div>

<p>October 26, 2009</p>

<p>Hon. Catherine Callbeck</p>

<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Dear Senator Callbeck:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>About a year ago we spoke on a number occasions about the importance of literacy and the need for training. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Since then, I have had a number of discussions with others on the subject and the Foundation has made a grant to the Summerside Home and School Association to assist in their project to encourage new mothers to read to their children.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Recently, the Board of Governors held a discussion as to community needs with literacy training was identified one of the priorities.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In fact, the Foundation has invited Barbara McNutt, Coordinator of Literacy Training, to address the issue at our next meeting. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>One of the problems with the current arrangements is that the various delivering agencies operate in isolation from each other.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is time, I suggest, to engage stakeholders (those who need, provide and pay for) in dialogue about the issue.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Out of the dialogue should come greater coordination if not cooperation?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Hopefully, also, we will identify key people to lead the initiative in the longer run<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Initiating dialogue will require a small amount of funding (copying, mailing, meeting space, perhaps for travel<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>from outside the Charlottetown area, etc.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Given our earlier conversation, I am wondering if you would be prepared to help.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Because I believe strongly in the need, I am prepared, Catherine, to give this initiative some personal attention.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I would be delighted to provide further information or meet at a mutually convenient time to discuss in detail.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Don Glendenning</p>
<p>Director</p>
