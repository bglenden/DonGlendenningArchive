<p>Claude and Bernice Bell</p>
<p>200 Hillsborough Street</p>
<p>Charlottetown, PE C1A 4W9</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Dear:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Recently the media reported the results of a survey by the Dominion Institute as to the state of teaching of Canadian history in our schools.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The release of the report triggered a couple of editorials and a number of letters in the local media and, while the Dominion Institute report spoke only about the public schools, the issue really reaches beyond the school system..</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>We, the Community Foundation of Prince Edward Island, wondered if we had a role to play in this issue.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Given our motto, connecting people who care with causes that matter, we answered “Yes”; and as with any other issue, we provide a vehicle to help make change happen.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Consequently, CFPEI proposes a Canada History Fund (Canada Fund?) for the purpose of promoting and encouraging the study of Canadian history.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The Fund could be used for any purpose that promotes the learning of Canadian history including school based activities but also, lectures, debates, forums, events and the purchase or preparation of learning materials.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Our goal for the fund is $100,000 which can be made up through a combination of named and unnamed endowments and flow-through donations.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>This is a follow-up to earlier conversations about a fund in your names at the Community Foundation of Prince Edward Island as part of your legacy and wonder if a fund for the promotion of Canadian history would be of interest.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If interested, I would be pleased to discuss the idea further with you.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Warm personal regards</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Don Glendenning</p>
<p>Director</p>
