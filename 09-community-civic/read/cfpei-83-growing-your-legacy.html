  CFPEI 83 Growing your legacy
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Newsletter No. 83 from March 29, 2008, presents Don&#x27;s philosophical reflections on legacy planning and endowments. Opening with a farmer&#x27;s parable about persistently moving a stone through repeated effort, Don draws parallels to building personal wealth and community legacies. He contrasts temporary donations with permanent endowments, emphasizing how legacy funds continue supporting causes after donors&#x27; deaths. The newsletter encourages people to establish endowments reflecting their interests, describing CFPEI&#x27;s experience in administering such funds and its commitment to honoring donor intentions over time. This piece reveals Don&#x27;s thoughtful approach to philanthropy and estate planning.</div>

	<p align="justify">From
	Little Acorns…</p>
	<p align="justify" style="font-weight: normal"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify"><span style="font-weight: normal">A
	farmer pastured his cows in the back field.  In the corner of the
	field was a large flat stone that he wanted for a front step at his
	new home – but he did not have the means to load it on to the
	wagon.  So, each morning when taking the cows to the pasture and
	evening when bringing them home, he reached under one edge of the
	stone and, with a mighty heave, flipped it over once in the
	direction of home. Before the snow blanketed his yard, his home
	sported a beautiful natural stone step – a step that would be
	cherished by in his family for generations to come.</span></p>
	<p align="justify" style="font-weight: normal"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify"><span style="font-weight: normal">We
	invest in our future in much the same way, one step at a time - a
	few dollars at a time through buying a bond, buying a home,
	purchasing a bit of real estate, adding to our savings account,
	purchasing stocks, paying off a mortgage, etc.  </span>
	</p>
	<p align="justify" style="font-weight: normal"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify"><span style="font-weight: normal">As
	we think of divestment, our first obligation is to provide for
	ourselves and our families.  The concept of a rainy day fund is
	replaced by the idea of a legacy fund.  Legacy funds continue
	support for cherished causes or organizations; legacy funds involve
	giving generously to the community that gave generously to us.  </span>
	</p>
	<p align="justify" style="font-weight: normal"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify"><span style="font-weight: normal">A
	legacy fund is different from just making a donation; a legacy fund
	keeps on supporting causes that matter to you when you are no longer
	available to provide that support personally.  </span>
	</p>
	<p align="justify" style="font-weight: normal"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify"><span style="font-weight: normal">Instead
	of, or in addition to, writing a cheque today or a bequest in a
	will, you are encouraged to establish an endowment.  If structured
	properly, your favourite charity will receive income in your name
	for years to come and your contribution, instead of being used up,
	will continue to grow in value.  </span>
	</p>
	<p align="justify" style="font-weight: normal"><br />

	</p>
	<p><span style="font-weight: normal">The Community
	Foundation of Prince Edward Island is experienced in setting up
	legacy funds; funds that reflect the interest of people just like
	you.  Funds can be set up anonymously or named, in one lump sum or
	over time, to make grants to a single charity or to a number of
	charities.</span></p>
	<p style="font-weight: normal"><br />

	</p>
	<p><span style="font-weight: normal">And the
	Foundation will continue to look after your interests, in future
	years should the charity of choice cease to exist or use your funds
	other than the way you intended. </span>
	</p>
	<p align="justify" style="font-weight: normal"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify" style="font-weight: normal">The
	Community Foundation of Prince Edward Island offers such a service;
	we are one of, if not the, most experienced organizations on the
	Island in setting up and administering endowments.  We can help you
	design a giving plan that matches your interests and resources, 
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><span style="font-weight: normal">Talk
	to us about your future giving interests and we’ll help design a
	plan that will work for you.</span></p>
