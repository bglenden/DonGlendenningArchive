<p>Chairs and Presidents</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Piping, Harbourfront, Victoria, Indian River, PEISO, Carrefour</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>As you know, the Community Foundation of Prince Edward Island is in the business of building and administering endowments.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In fact, at the close of the Island Arts and Heritage Stabilization Project and again during the development of a joint brochure for arts organizations, we discussed formalizing arrangements between our two organizations whereby the community foundation would administer an endowment exclusively for you.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>We would like to pick up on the idea and, this letter comes seeking an opportunity to meet with you, your Board or whoever you designate, to explore any mutual interest that we may have.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>To add impetus to our initiative, we learned recently that the Department of Canadian Heritage has recently extended the their Endowment Incentives Program with a deadline for the next round of applications being December 1, 2009.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Because of this, I feel it important that we expedite the process as quickly as possible.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>This is wonderful news in that it allows the federal government to match locally raised funds placed in an endowment.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Participation requires the arts organization to team up with a public foundation.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Fuurthermore, it is my understanding that your organizations qualifies for the program but the decision rests with the Department of Canadian Heritage.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>For further information on the program, I refer you to the DOCH website at HYPERLINK "http://www.pch.gc.ca/pgm/fcic-ccif/103-eng.cfm" <span>http://www.pch.gc.ca/pgm/fcic-ccif/103-eng.cfm</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I will be in touch with you shortly to see if you are interested in exploring the issue and seeking a mutually convenient time to meet.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If a number of organizations are interested, it may be possible to have a DOCH representative meet with us to explain the program and answer questions.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>We believe this to be a great opportunity for Island arts organizations and look forward to working with you in support of the arts.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I am also enclosing some information about the Foundation and its activities.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
<p><br></p>
