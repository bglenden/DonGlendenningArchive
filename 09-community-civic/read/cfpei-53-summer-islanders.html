  CFPEI 53 -Summer Islanders
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Published in October 2006, this newsletter describes CFPEI&#x27;s initiative to establish a Summer Islanders Legacy Fund targeting seasonal residents from Canada and the USA who return annually to PEI. The foundation promoted this with a July 4 reception for US citizens and an August advertisement. The Summer Islanders Fund supports landscape, arts, heritage, genealogy, health, environment, and education initiatives. The newsletter outlines plans for 2007 including a second US Citizens&#x27; Day Reception (led by Garth Staples), a summer social, and summer lecture series. This reflects Don&#x27;s vision for leveraging non-resident wealth to support PEI community development and his inclusive approach to philanthropic engagement.</div>

	<p align="justify"><span style="font-weight: normal">In
	discussing our mission, to improve the quality of life on Prince
	Edward Island, we noted that PEI provides a summer home for many
	people whose full-time residence is elsewhere.  </span>

	<p align="justify" style="font-weight: normal"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify">Summer Islanders<span style="font-weight: normal">
	are visitors who spend time on the Island on a regular basis and who
	think that PEI is a special corner of the world.  They may come from
	any corner of the globe but our contacts so far have been from
	Canada and the USA.  All share an interest in supporting initiatives
	that help to maintain the Island as a place to which Summer
	Islanders want to return year after year.</span></p>
	<p align="justify" style="font-weight: normal"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify"><span style="font-weight: normal">Our
	first initiative was a reception on July 4, 2006, for US citizens. 
	The purpose was to welcome and thank them for their many
	contributions to our communities and events.  The event was reported
	in Issue No. 48 and, for those who missed it, is available on our
	website.</span></p>
	<p align="justify" style="font-weight: normal"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify" style="font-weight: normal">In
	August CFPEI placed an advertisement in the local paper to alert
	summer Islanders to the initiatives being taken.</p>
	<p align="justify" style="font-weight: normal"><br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify"><span style="font-weight: normal">As
	a result, I am pleased to report that a Summer Islanders PEI Legacy
	Fund, within the Community Foundation of Prince Edward Island, is
	now in place and available to persons wishing to contribute.  (The
	Foundation is a registered as a charitable organization in both
	Canada and the USA and can issue receipts acceptable to tax
	authorities in both countries).  Grants from the earnings will be
	made on the advice of a Committee of Summer Islanders and may be
	used to support a wide variety of interests including the landscape,
	arts, heritage, genealogy, Health, environment and education</span></p>
