<p>Mr. George Rogers</p>
<p>C/o Nesbitt Burns</p>
<p>Bankers Hall, West Tower</p>
<p>4100-888 Third St. SW</p>
<p>Calgary, Alberta	T2P 5C5</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Dear Mr. Rogers:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>During a recent conversation about the importance of preserving PEI’s heritage, the many contributions that your mother, Irene Rogers, made to PEI”s heritage were acknowledged.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I, too, although a newcomer to PEI some 40 years ago, am very aware of the work that she did and her appreciation of the Island’s way of life.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>We believe that her contributions should be recognized in an appropriate manner; therefore, that is the purpose for my letter - would you consider establishing a heritage fund in her memory to ensure that her work is remembered and to continue the work that she loved?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If so, the Community Foundation of Prince Edward Island could be of assistance to you.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>First, let me explain that the Community Foundation of PEI is a volunteer driven, registered, non-profit, charitable organization. Our mission is to improve quality of life on PEI through the creation and building of endowment funds that will help ensure vital futures for Island communities.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The Foundation provides a means for individuals, families, community groups, corporations, and private foundations to support philanthropic activities which invest in sustainable solutions to community needs. We connect people who care with causes that matter.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>As you will see from the enclosed information, Funds can be in any amount and built with a single contribution or over time... I am enclosing some information about our activities.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I would welcome an opportunity to explore further with you how we could recognize and honour your mother’s contribution to Prince Edward Island... <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Don Glendenning</p>
<p>Director<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
