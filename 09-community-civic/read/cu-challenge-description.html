<p><b>Background	</b>Most charitable giving is focused on meeting immediate needs and for specific causes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Reflection and informal consultation indicates a parallel need to develop longer term plan and resources in the charitable sector at the community level and not to be solely dependent upon the efforts of particular interest groups regardless of how relevant and important such initiatives may be.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>	With this view in mind, CFPEI pr5oposes a Community Challenge Program to encourage communities, not just organizations, to build resources to meet future anticipated an unanticipated community needs.</p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Objectives:	</b>to encourage and assist Island communities to establish an endowment building initiative as one of its tools for long-term community development</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Concept	</b>CFPEI will invite communities throughout the Island to establish and grow an endowment fund, the earnings from which will be available in perpetuity in support of the charitable purposes of the local community. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>	</p>
<p>Under an agreement with a community, CFPEI will make a grant of $1,000 to a charity, or charities, of the participating community’s choice annually for a five year period on condition that the community establish and add to the endowment at the rate of at least $5,000 per year during the same period.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>At the end of the five years, the community fund should be large enough to continue the practice in perpetuity.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Definition</b>	A community fund is an undesignated endowment from which grants may be made for any charitable purpose in the community as allowed under regulations of the Canada Customs and Revenue Agency.</p>
