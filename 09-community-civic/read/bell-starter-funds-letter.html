  Bell-Starter Funds- letter
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Letter from Don Glendenning introducing CFPEI to prospects, emphasizing the foundation&#x27;s unique role as a public foundation on PEI and its experience establishing 40+ endowments. Don discusses community foundations&#x27; focus on perpetual endowments, their convener role (citing $800K channeled to arts over 4 years), and the importance of legacy planning. The letter showcases Don&#x27;s deep commitment to building charitable infrastructure on the island.</div>

<p>Starter Funds</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>As a follow-up to earlier conversations, I wanted to provide you with some detailed information about the Community Foundation of Prince Edward Island and also let you know of a new initiative to build a charitable legacy over a period of years.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>First, however, let me say a few things about community foundations.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>OR</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>This letter comes to introduce you to the Community Foundation of Prince Edward Island</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Community foundations are unique in that they focus on endowments, granting in perpetuity, a broad range of community interests and the fact that they represent the interests of the donor not the recipient.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>CFPEI is the only public foundation on Prince Edward; all others serve a very limited interest.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Among our grantees we list UPEI and Holland College students, hospitals, youth groups, health organizations, the planting of memorial trees, heritage, arts, etc.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We also administer funds for other charitable organizations and are currently in active discussion with a number of individuals and organizations who have or want to arrange long term financial support for causes of interest.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Having been involved in one way or another with the establishment of more than 40 endowments, I feel comfortable in saying that CFPEI is the most experienced organization on the Island when it comes to designing charitable funds and plans reflecting donor interests and community needs.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>A couple of things less well known about CFPEI is the role we play as “conveners” meaning that we bring people or organizations together to explore common interests in improving our community; as an example I point to our role with the arts community resulting in the channeling of $800,000 into the arts over a 4 year period.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A second service is that of flow-through grants to other charities. For example, one US donor, who wishes to remain anonymous, makes a gift to CFPEI along with instructions as to where grants are to be made.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Our normal services include:</p>
<p>Designing and establishing endowments. Investing and monitoring performance, and auditing and reporting on to both the public and the Canada Revenue Agency</p>
<p>Making grants that reflect a donor’s wishes and create value within the charitable sector; a donor’s wishes could be as simple as naming charities of interest to which grants are to be made</p>
<p>providing information and advice to individuals, organizations and other foundations on existing and potential community needs</p>
<p>accepting donations of any kind including cash, real estate, personal property, stocks, bonds and other financial instruments; this could include acting as Executor to an estate</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>All of us are faced with decisions on a regular basis as to how much we can give and to what causes; there are many needs and all are worthwhile, so we make our decisions based on our unique set of criteria.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Too often, I feel we leave decisions about a rainy day legacy fund until very late in life.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We at the foundation believe that legacy decisions should be made earlier and built over time<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Decisions about one’s estate are both important and personal; increasingly people tell me that, after family have been taken care of, they want to give back to the community that supported them, not just an annual contribution but in the form of a permanent legacy.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Many are opting to make that provision now rather than after death.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I, and we, at the Community Foundation of Prince Edward Island, have appreciated your interest and support in times past and would welcome an opportunity,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>preferably to assist you but if not then your Executor, in hosting an endowment to carry your legacy into the future.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>If you require additional information or would like to explore options and ideas, do not hesitate to contact me</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Warm personal regards</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Don Glendenning</p>
<p>Director</p>
