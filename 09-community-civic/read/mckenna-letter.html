<p>Mr. David McKenna</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Dear David:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Based on a very brief conversation yesterday about endowment funds at the Community Foundation of Prince Edward Island, I decided to draft an agreement on the establishment of a McKenna Fund for your consideration.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This is a proforma agreement and contains our standard clauses.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Specific clauses are added, in the agreement or in an appendix if needed, to more adequately reflect the donor’s interests.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>As you know, community foundations offer a wide range of possibilities; the attached draft is for an interest fund.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The draft agreement identifies environmental issues as the focus of the proposed fund, however, this can be easily changed to suit another set of donor interests.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The environment is a sufficiently broad field to include scholarships or grants to organizations working in the field.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Had we had a bit more time, we could have defined the donor interests more fully.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I am also enclosing some background information about the Foundation; I would call your attention especially to the list of funds given on page two? of the Community Reporter.<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Since the Newsletter was published, our investment portfolio has grown to more than $700,000 in some 26 endowments with our most recent being the David A Mackay Fund focused on immediate response services in the case of medical emergencies.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I would be pleased, David, to discuss the matter further with you.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I am at my cottage in Earnscliffe, 651-2186, should you want to phone.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>On the other hand I am in town frequently and would be happy to schedule a meeting at a convenient time.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Thanks for you interest.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have further questions.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Don Glendenning</p>
<p>Director.</p>
