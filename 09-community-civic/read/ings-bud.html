<div class="reader-summary">Don&#x27;s personal letter to Bud Ings regarding establishing a memorial endowment in the name of Connie (likely Connie Ings). Don recalls Connie&#x27;s significant contributions to PEI, particularly her role in forming the Community Foundation, and proposes creating a permanent endowment to honor her interests in beautification and community service. The letter demonstrates Don&#x27;s personal relationships with community leaders and his skill at recognizing and memorializing contributions to the Island.</div>

<p>Bud Ings</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>It was great to see you recently if only for a few minutes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That was my first visit to the Marina(?) and I was very impressed with the facilities and the atmosphere – and what a beautiful view over the Montague River..</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>During our brief conversation, we spoke briefly about Connie; her contributions to the Island were varied and many.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Among them was her contribution to the formation of the Community Foundation of Prince Edward Island and, as you may recall, that was a subject of many coffees and conversations. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Our conversation also included a reference to a memorial in Connie’s name.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>What I had in mind was an endowment the income from which would be used to make grants in Connie’s name in perpetuity.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As you will see from the enclosed brochures, the Foundation now administers some fifty funds, including memorials, serving a variety of interests.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I am sure that many of Connie’s family and friends would also be supportive of such an initiative.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Connie had many interests; you and your family would be in the best position to chose an area that<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>best reflects her interests.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I think of her<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>interest in beautification, the beautiful flowers around your home, but I also thing of concerns for her neighbours and her community as well.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As you will note, the Foundation already offers a number of scholarships; perhaps one in Connie’s name for a student from the Montague area would area would be in order.</p>
<p>. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>I am enclosing some information about th Foundation.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I expect to be in Montague again before the end of the month and will get in touch beforehand with a view to talking further..</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Warmest personal regards</p>
