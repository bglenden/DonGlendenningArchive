<p>Dear Sir:</p>
<p><span>A. John Robinson</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I am pleased to support the nomination of A. John Robinson to the Order of Prince Edward Island. I have known John for many years and know him to be a most worthy candidate.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>While I am aware of John’s status as a successful farmer, businessman, volunteer and philanthropist, it is his leadership role with the Community Foundation with which I am able to speak. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The Community Foundation of Prince Edward Island (CFPEI) is a charitable organization whose role is to encourage and assist Islanders in meeting their charitable objectives. It does this primarily through the building and administering of endowments the income from which is used to support charitable activities.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Its establishment has been a success story, and John has been a major contributor to that success.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>CFPEI was established in 1993 and, when John joined the Board, had an endowment of perhaps $100,000; today that endowment is more than $10,000,000, Much of its success is attributable to John’s leadership, trust and standing in the community including the direct application of his considerable knowledge of finance and investment. John understands PEI; his insights allow him to see both a community’s needs and a community’s capacity to respond to its needs.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Those talents resulted in the growth and maturation of he Community Foundation of Prince Edward Island.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The Robinson Family is a well-recognized and respected community family; giving back is a family tradition.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>John and his family are concerned, generous and dedicated to the Island community; it is without any reservation whatsoever, that I support this nomination.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
