Dear Sir
High School for the Arts

First let me offer my congratulations to Tessa Mossey and Ben Moran whose accomplishments
as theatre students at the Walnut Hill School were reported in Saturday's Guardian.

My other reason for writing, however, is to put forward the idea of a High School for the Arts in PEI; u,e are able to attract people to the Culinary Institute, College of Piping, Atlantic Police
Academy, Atlantic Veterinary College, and others, so why not to a centre for training people in
the arts. With the recent school closings, finding space should not be a problem.

The arts add significantly to our quality of life, are recognized as a major contributor to
individual development, provide opportunities for rewarding careers, are a welcome change from work routines, allow for individual creativity and constitute an important part of our economy.

Most of the above schools, perhaps all, came into being as a result of collaboration between,  government, the community to be served, the private sector and an educational institution. The
same mix would be appropriate for a new venture. Leadership may come from any of the
stakeholders.

Information about Walnut Hill School may be found at r,vr,vr.i,.walnuthillarts.org. Similar schools operate in Canada; a quick search of the internet turned up thirty. Some schools are part of the regular system, others are private and some operate as charter schools.

Let the planning begin.

Sincerely

Don Glendenning.
