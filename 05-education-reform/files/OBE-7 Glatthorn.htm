GLATTHORN, <i>East Carolina University</i></center><p>Reports in educational journals and newspapers indicate growing interest in Outcome-Based Education (OBE), which is both a comprehensive reform strategy and a curriculum model. It therefore seems like an appropriate time to examine it thoroughly and objectively. This article seeks, therefore, to provide an objective critique of OBE as both a reform strategy and a curriculum process, based on my reading of the OBE literature and my work with several school systems in North Carolina interested in implementing the model.<p><center><b>OBE AS A REFORM STRATEGY</b></center>Outcome-based education is a movement conceived and developed chiefly by William G. Spady. In Spady&#39;s published works, he identifies these principles or characteristics as important in a &quot;fully operational outcomes-based school&quot;:<p><ul><li>A collectively endorsed mission statement that reflects commitment to success for all students and provides the means for translating that commitment into action.<p><li>Clearly defined, publicly derived &quot;exit outcomes&quot; that reflect changing societal conditions and that students must demonstrate before they leave school. (He argues that the best OBE schools focus on &quot;life-role&quot; competencies as their intended outcomes.)<p><li>A tightly articulated curriculum framework of program, course, and unit outcomes that derive from the exit outcomes. The framework integrates knowledge and competence across domains and facilitates the accomplishment of outcomes.<p><li>A system of instructional decision making and delivery that employs a variety of methods, assures successful demonstration of all outcomes, and provides more than one chance for students to be successful. (He advocates giving &quot;incomplete&quot; grades until students achieve mastery.)<p><li>A criterion-referenced and consistently applied system of assessment, performance standards, credentialing, and reporting.<p><li>A system of instructional placement, grouping, and eligibility that facilitates individual progress.<p><li>An ongoing system of program improvement that includes staff accountability, effective leadership, and staff collaboration.<p><li>A data base of significant, visionary outcomes for all students, plus key indicators of school effectiveness, that is used and updated regularly to improve conditions and practices that affect student and staff success.<a name="t1"></a><a href="#1">(1)</a></ul><p>To determine the usefulness of OBE as a reform strategy, it seems appropriate to identify the criteria for evaluating such a strategy, provide whatever evidence is available, and render a judgment. Part of the difficulty in evaluating it from this perspective is the relative thinness of the research base. Although Spady reports widespread adoption of the model, with several schools reporting success, only a few systematic research efforts have studied the implementation and effects of the OBE model as a comprehensive reform strategy. Nevertheless, the following criteria can be considered as a basis for evaluating the usefulness of OBE as a reform strategy.<p><i>Is the OBE reform model coherent?</i> Coherence refers to the interrelatedness of elements leading to a sense of wholeness. For example, the &quot;effective schools&quot; movement seems to be a collection of unrelated &quot;correlates&quot; without any coherent sense of oneness. An analysis of the OBE model suggests that it is more coherent than the fragmented effective schools model. Its elements seem to relate to and support one another.<p><i>Is the OBE reform model comprehensive?</i> Comprehensiveness deals with a concern for completeness. A comprehensive model would include all the elements required for the restructuring of the schools. Here the OBE model seems flawed because it ignores several elements considered essential in a comprehensive approach to reform. Current research on school effectiveness suggests that several additional elements should be part of any comprehensive restructuring of schools.<a name="t2"></a><a href="#2">(2)</a> These include (1) consistent, systematic, and research-based efforts to improve student motivation to learn; (2) special programs for both gifted and &quot;at-risk&quot; students; (3) strong district leadership and support, especially in such areas as school-site management, curriculum planning, school monitoring, and leadership development; and (4) structures through which teachers and parents work cooperatively to ensure a supportive home environment for learning.<p><i>Are the individual elements of the OBE reform strategy supported by empirical research?</i>&nbsp; A careful reading of the OBE literature suggests that its chief weakness is the instructional model recommended. That model emphasizes three elements: (1) mastery learning, (2) individualized strategy, and (3) promotion based on achievement. Each of these seems questionable.<p>Although Spady rejects the use of the term <i>mastery learning</i>, the instructional model he advocates is similar to that advanced by Block and Anderson.<a name="t3"></a><a href="#3">(3)</a> The evidence on the effectiveness of this model is inconclusive. Guskey and Gates present a generally supportive review, but Slavin provides a rather negative critique.<a name="t4"></a><a href="#4">(4)</a> Until more conclusive research is available, it would seem unwise to include this instructional model as an essential component of school reform.<p>Next, the emphasis upon individualized progress and self-pacing may not result in optimal learning. Research reviews indicate that such individualized systems are effective in college, but not in elementary, middle, and high schools.<a name="t5"></a><a href="#5">(5)</a> Such an emphasis also risks minimizing use of cooperative learning, an approach that Slavin notes is consistently associated with the accomplishment of both affective and cognitive outcomes.<a name="t6"></a><a href="#6">(6)</a> It should be noted, however, that Spady does recommend the use of diverse teaching and learning methods, including cooperative learning.<p>Finally, the requirement that students master objectives before they move ahead may result in retention in grade at the elementary and middle levels, a practice discredited by the research.<a name="t7"></a><a href="#7">(7)</a> The literature on OBE does not confront this difficulty.<p><i>Is the OBE reform model &quot;teacher friendly&quot;?</i> This criterion assumes that any effective model of restructuring needs the acceptance and support of teachers. The evidence here suggests teachers in general agree with OBE principles and practices. In a study of the implementation of OBE in Utah, Applegate and Evans found that in the 10 districts that had achieved fullest implementation of OBE, 97 percent of the staff surveyed reported attitudes and beliefs in agreement with OBE principles; in the 10 districts that had the least implementation, 67 percent were in agreement.<a name="t8"></a><a href="#8">(8)</a> Burns and Wood determined that teachers were positive about the effects of the implementation of OBE, elementary teachers slightly more so than secondary teachers.<a name="t9"></a><a href="#9">(9)</a> It should be noted, however, that teachers surveyed and interviewed in 10 OBE sites in Minnesota reported some confusion about and some disagreement with OBE principles.<a name="t10"></a><a href="#10">(10)</a><p><i>Does the OBE reform model embody a sound approach to educational change?</i> &nbsp; Here again, the OBE model, like other restructuring models, relies on a complex change process that makes excessive demands upon resources. OBE is very time-consuming; the extensive planning process may require more time than many districts would like to use. Some districts report spending as many as four years in restructuring according to OBE principles. Its scope and complexity also seem at odds with the incremental change process recommended by Louis and Miles.<a name="t11"></a><a href="#11">(11)</a> Their studies of improving high schools led them to conclude that a problem-focused incremental strategy may be more effective than grand schemes to restructure schools.<p><i>Is the OBE reform model effective?</i> This criterion may be the most important. And, like some other models of restructuring, the OBE model has not been systematically and rigorously evaluated. However, several articles by OBE implementers claim that achievement scores have improved.<a name="t12"></a><a href="#12">(12)</a> Although these reports may lack grounding in soundly designed studies, the testimony of adopters should be given some credence, even when they seem to be exercises in self-congratulation.<p>On balance, then, OBE seems to be a generally useful model for school reform, as long as educators are aware of its potential pitfalls.<p><center><b>OBE AS A CURRICULUM MODEL</b></center>How effective is OBE as a model for curriculum development? To answer this question, it would be useful to delineate more carefully the curriculum process that Spady recommends.<p>First, school systems are to identify &quot;exit outcomes,&quot; the general learner goals the schools hope to accomplish in 12 years of schooling. In a recent interview with Brandt, Spady argues for two special characteristics of such outcomes.<a name="t13"></a><a href="#13">(13)</a> First, they should be culminating demonstrations of learning, not specific grade-level competencies. Second, they should be derived from an analysis of adult life roles (such as &quot;lifelong learners&quot;), not from an analysis of the subject disciplines. Here, for example, are the exit outcomes developed by the educators and citizens of the Arlington Heights (Illinois) school district:<p><ul><li>Ability to communicate (in reading, writing, speaking, listening, and numeracy skills)<p><li>Facility in social interactions<p><li>Analytic capabilities<p><li> Problem-solving skills<p><li> Skill in making value judgments and decisions<p><li> Skill in creative expression and in responding to the creative work of others<p><li>Civic responsibility<p><li>Responsible participation in a global environment<p><li>Skill in developing and maintaining wellness<p><li>Skill in using technology as a tool for learning<p><li>Skill in life and career planning<a name="t14"></a><a href="#14">(14)</a></ul><p>As the list suggests, most of the OBE exit outcomes developed by schools are derived from an analysis of the skills and knowledge that students will need to lead successful lives in the year 2000. Spady argues that this is the only legitimate basis for developing curriculum in &quot;true OBE&quot; schools.<p>Once the exit outcomes are identified, they are then allocated to the school&#39;s programs. <i>Program</i>, as Spady uses the term, includes the curricular program (the several subjects making up the curriculum), the activity program, and the student services program (including school health, guidance, and social services). Including the activity and student services programs as factors in developing the exit outcomes is a useful contribution of Spady and his colleagues. Too many curriculum experts imply in their writings that educational outcomes can be achieved only through the written curriculum.<p>It should be noted here that Spady believes that the curricular program should not be subject-based. He argues for a &quot;transformational curriculum in which the &quot;complex role performance outcomes&quot; become the organizing center, not a given subject. As he puts it, &quot;Mathematics in our framework is an enabling outcome, not an outcome in its own right.&quot;<a name="t15"></a><a href="#15">(5)</a><p>OBE curriculum workers now turn their attention to the outcomes for a particular curriculum program, such as a science (using a subject-based framework), or &quot;problem solving&quot; (using a life-role framework). The program outcomes for any subject or organizing center are derived from and contribute to the exit outcomes. Here, for example, is a program outcome that might be derived from the exit outcome &quot;ability to communicate&quot;: <i>Write clearly and effectively in a variety of genres, for a variety of audiences, in real communication contexts.</i><p>Now the developers turn to the next level, the course (or grade-level) outcomes that have been derived from and contribute to the program outcomes. These are the outcomes that developers want students to achieve in a single year. For example, the following course outcome for Grade 11 English (or for Communication Skills Level 11) might be derived from the above program outcome: <i>Write a clear and effective letter to the editor of your local paper, taking a stand on a controversial issue, supporting your position with evidence, and refuting the arguments of the opposition.</i><p>By analyzing the course outcomes, developers (or teachers) now identify the unit outcomes that will contribute to the course outcomes. For the course outcome stated above, curriculum workers might develop a unit in &quot;Persuading Others&quot; that would include this unit outcome: <i>Effectively refute the arguments of those opposing your position on a controversial issue.</i><p>With the unit outcomes identified, the developers (or teachers) identify the lesson outcomes that contribute to the unit outcomes. Here is one lesson outcome for the above unit outcome: <i>Analyze the audience to determine the rebuttal strategies most likely to be effective</i>.<p>Spady describes this approach as a &quot;design down&quot; process, moving from exit outcomes to lesson outcomes in a carefully structured manner.<p>To examine the merits of the OBE curriculum process, it would be useful to pose and respond to several questions often raised by critics of OBE, including those raised by McKernan in this issue.<a name="t16"></a><a href="#16">(16)</a><p><i>Is the OBE curriculum model too narrow in its theoretical grounding?</i> The answer is probably yes. As others have noted, there are several bases for designing curricula: the nature of the subject disciplines; the knowledge for transmitting the culture; the skills for reconstructing society; the nature of cognition; the needs of the individual. While Spady effectively argues for &quot;complex life-roles&quot; as the single basis, no empirical evidence suggests such an approach is inherently better than the others.<p>This narrowness also leads Spady and his colleagues to slight the importance of subject matter knowledge. As noted above, Spady argues forcefully for &quot;transformational&quot; curricula in which the subjects are not the organizing center but are considered only as &quot;enabling&quot; outcomes. In this sense, transformational curricula may be seen as an extreme version of curriculum integration. The research in general supports the effectiveness of curriculum integration; and multidisciplinary units built around complex issues will likely be more appealing to children and youth.<p>However, this &quot;transformational&quot; approach is not necessarily effective or inherently superior to subject-centered approaches. As Brophy and Alleman note, curriculum integration is a means, not an end; they point out that many integrated units they have examined are badly designed collections of activities.<a name="t17"></a><a href="#17">(17)</a><p>Also, increasing evidence suggests that in-depth knowledge is essential for problem solving. As Resnick and Klopfer point out, experts in a field reason more powerfully on topics that they understand in depth.<a name="t18"></a><a href="#18">(18)</a> Such indepth knowledge would seem difficult to achieve in &quot;transformational&quot; units that deal with broad and complex multidisciplinary issues.<p><i>Is the OBE curriculum model too &quot;technocratic&quot; in its orientation?</i> The answer is uncertain, for the term <i>technocratic</i> is often a vaguely defined pejorative used by those who label themselves with the honorific &quot;humanistic.&quot; Identifying outcomes as the entry point for developing curricula can be an effective strategy and does not necessarily lead to batch processing, fragmented learning, and the dehumanizing of the classroom, as critics claim.<p>Both Spady and his critics should take a broader view. Several entry points can be used in developing curriculum units (where the issue is most directly joined). Developers can begin by selecting materials, such as the PBS &quot;Civil War&quot; videotapes, and use those as the center of the unit. They can begin by identifying activities, such as &quot;reenact the surrender scene involving Grant and Lee,&quot; and frame the rest of the unit accordingly. In a more traditional manner, they can begin with objectives: &quot;Explain how Lee felt about the issue of slavery.&quot; Or they can agree not to design in advance, urging the classroom teacher to ask, &#39;What questions about the Civil War would you like to answer?&quot; To argue that one of these is necessarily right or wrong is to equate one&#39;s prejudice with an eternal verity.<p>This argument that OBE is too technocratic is often associated with two other criticisms-that OBE is antithetical to the development and maintenance of a warm and caring classroom environment and that it inevitably leads to an undemocratic &quot;molding&quot; of students.<a name="t19"></a><a href="#19">(19)</a> Both of these charges need to be examined carefully.<p>The charge that the OBE curriculum process contributes to an uncaring climate is for the most part groundless. Classroom climate results from complex interactions between the teacher and the students and among the students themselves-interactions dependent chiefly upon the values and behaviors of the classroom teacher and secondarily upon the instructional technology. It would seem patently absurd to suggest that teachers using an OBE instructional model are uncaring people.<p>It can be argued that a given instructional technology, such as the exclusive use of computers or learning packages, would diminish the quality and quantity of teacher and learner interactions. However, in fairness to OBE supporters, it should be noted here that they advocate the use of multiple learning methods, including cooperative learning.<p>The criticism that the OBE model ineluctably supports a &quot;molding&quot; process also lacks foundation. An outcome at any level can be stated in a way that emphasizes inquiry, not molding, Consider this, for example, as a unit outcome: <i>Investigate the roots, the nature, and the limitations of tolerance as an attitude towards ethnic minorities</i>. That presents much less of a &quot;molding&quot; stance than the one implicit in McKernan&#39;s Northern Ireland program that had the explicit outcome of encouraging tolerance.<p><i>Does the &quot;design down &quot; process remove curriculum making too far from the classroom and depreciate the role of the teacher as a curriculum maker?</i> &nbsp; Two matters need to be examined here: What <i>should</i>  be the role of the teacher in the development of curriculum? What role do teachers play in the OBE model?<p>The first question is chiefly a value-laden one. Experts differ sharply about what should be the roles of the national government, the state department of education, the school district curriculum office, the school curriculum office, the department or the grade-level team, and the classroom teacher in developing curricula. My own work with more than a hundred school districts and my own valuing of cooperative processes suggest that the teacher&#39;s role in curriculum development should vary with the level of curriculum making. As Table 1 indicates, the various levels of curriculum making should involve quite different agents as primary and secondary participants.<p><p><center><table><caption><b><center>Table 1.  Activities and Participants in the Curriculum Development Process</center></b></caption><tr valign="TOP"><th><u>Curriculum development activity</u></th><th><u>Primary and secondary participants</u></th></tr><tr valign="TOP"><td>Identify exit outcomes</td><td>State board of education, with review by school board, parents, and teachers</td></tr><tr valign="TOP"><td>Allocate exit outcomes to programs</td><td>District committee, with input from teachers</td></tr><tr valign="TOP"><td>Identify program outcomes</td><td>District committee, with input from teachers</td></tr><tr valign="TOP"><td>Identify course outcomes</td><td>Grade-level teams of teachers</td></tr><tr valign="TOP"><td>Identify unit outcomes</td><td>Grade-level teams of teachers</td></tr><tr valign="TOP"><td>Identify lesson outcomes</td><td>Individual classroom teachers</td></tr></table></center><p>Those who argue for the classroom teacher as the sole curriculum maker ignore the legitimate roles of the state and the school district in identifying exit outcomes for all students, for achieving K-12 coordination, and for establishing equity across classrooms and schools. The emphasis on the teacher as the sole determiner of curriculum also ignores the realities of curriculum making as it presently occurs. Consider, for example, the increasing trend towards state activism in the curriculum field. North Carolina is one of many states that issue very specific curriculum guides and assess students with tests based on those curricula. Consider as well the high-quality curriculum work being accomplished by federally funded projects-work that should be integrated into any local project. Arguing for teacher-made curricula in such contexts is naive at best.<p>The second question is easily answered. Reports on the curriculum development process by school districts using the OBE approach indicate significant teacher involvement. Teachers participate in the review of the exit outcomes, they contribute to the process of allocating outcomes to programs, they collaborate in the identification of program outcomes, and they play an active role in developing units. The evidence cited above that teachers in general support OBE would also lead one to question the assertion that the OBE curriculum model is &quot;teacher hostile.&quot;<p>This is not to suggest, however, that Spady&#39;s &quot;design down&quot; process is inherently superior to other approaches. The approach I have been using with school districts is an eclectic recursive one that uses state exit outcomes, involves teachers in decision making throughout the process, draws from high-quality products developed by major curriculum centers, and helps teachers develop units that reflect and embody a constructivist approach to learning. I do not claim that the model is the right or best one; I note only that it seems to work.<p><i>Is the OBE curriculum process suitable only for training purposes?</i> McKernan and others have charged that OBE by its nature is not suitable for accomplishing such ends as solving problems, appreciating literature, and developing standards of judgment. The simplest way to refute such a charge is to demonstrate to the contrary. Consider this array:<p><ul><li>Exit outcome-Develop aesthetic appreciation.<p><li>Program outcome-Appreciate literature.<p><li>Course outcome-Appreciate American poetry.<p><li>Unit outcome-Appreciate the poetry of Robert Frost<p><li>Lesson outcome-Appreciate in one&#39;s own terms &quot;Stopping by Woods.&quot;</ul><p> Like other curriculum process models, OBE can accommodate a range of outcomes; it is not by its nature limited to a training approach.<p><i>Does the OBE curriculum process result in high quality curricula?</i> &nbsp; Only an uncertain response is objectively possible. The process itself seems to be one of many effective process models. And my experience suggests that, suitably modified for local contexts, it can result in useful products.<p>Some concerns, however, must be acknowledged. First, the OBE model does not seem to make provisions for the use of exemplary curricula developed by experts in the field. Several federally funded projects in science and mathematics are yielding high-quality curricula. It is unclear how OBE curricula would make effective use of such materials.<p>Also, curriculum materials produced by districts fully committed to OBE have not impressed me with their quality. Although I have not made a systematic evaluation of all such materials, I have examined some that OBE trainers consider exemplary. One presented at an OBE workshop as a model of curriculum making consisted of a rather conventional unit that required students to make a scrapbook of poems they liked. Another, sent to me in response to a request for good materials, was a mediocre treatment of propaganda, using approaches that originated in the 1940s. There was no reference to current research on persuasion, only the usual superficial analysis of &quot;bandwagon,&quot; &quot;plain folks,&quot; and other such strategies.<p>In conclusion, I am suggesting that OBE is not the panacea that Spady believes it to be. Neither is it a pernicious movement to turn schools into factories, as its critics suggest.<p><p><center><b></b></center><h4> FOOTNOTES</h4><ol><a name="1"></a><li>William G.
