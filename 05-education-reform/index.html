The World Bank, largest public education contributor, cautions countries against confusing schooling with education. PEI does conflate them, focusing on serving youth in schools rather than all Islanders across ages, interests, and capabilities. Education is a service to help people gain/develop knowledge, skills, attitudes, values, and attributes; collaboration between educators and community is essential. Standard education services include information, counseling, learning products, technology, analysis, instruction, human resources, and tracking. Services should be clearly identified and promoted, with help tailored to individual learner needs. Restructuring should begin with: (1) common understanding of education; (2) clear purpose; (3) identified services.

World Bank research cautions against this conflation. Education encompasses all learning—at home, school, church, play, work—developing knowledge, skills, attitudes, and values. Oregon&#x27;s Department of Public Instruction identifies six life roles: individual, family member, student, worker, and citizen (five of six listed). Don critiques PEI&#x27;s narrow departmental self-description: &quot;developing and delivering curriculum&quot; to young Islanders. He proposes the government&#x27;s role is better described as &quot;encouraging, supporting and regulating&quot; education for all Islanders across all contexts—home, school, work, community—not just youth in schools.

Additional recommendations include establishing accountabilities (helping change lives, not just running schools), increasing school autonomy (per OECD), documenting functions, providing benchmarks, encouraging engagement and collaboration, discontinuing student ranking (not an educational function), and maintaining an education focus.

He references World Bank warnings against confusing &quot;going to school&quot; with &quot;getting an education,&quot; observes that PEI&#x27;s Department structure focuses on running schools rather than providing education services, and concludes the current system is misaligned with community needs and expectations.

Don observes that most PEI government departments structure by field/branch: Agriculture (land, crops, potatoes), Health (COVID, drugs, e-health, hospitals), Fisheries (fishing, hunting, wildlife, trapping). Education, however, organizes by study levels (elementary, secondary, postsecondary), a notably different structural criterion. Don proposes alternative organizing principles: essential/occupational skills (welding, arts, science, technology), or life roles (citizen, individual, family member, student, producer, consumer). He uses a culinary metaphor—focus on the menu (educational services) rather than the dining room (schools)—suggesting that top leadership in Department and schools should focus on educational services, not school operation.

He notes that departmental literature references &quot;creating opportunities for student success,&quot; &quot;securing a place in society,&quot; and &quot;developing high quality programs,&quot; but argues these statements lack sufficient specificity for program design or results measurement. Don proposes that education&#x27;s purpose is helping people gain knowledge, skills, attitudes, and attributes for various life roles (citizen, family member, individual, student, consumer, producer), with citizen and employment contexts most frequently mentioned by Islanders. A clear purpose, Don argues, would direct organizational structure and provide focus for instruction and assessment, shifting teacher work from subject/grade delivery to enabling students&#x27; life role competence. He calls this &quot;purpose firm&quot; (quoting a Sunday School teacher) and urgently needed.<div class="expanded-tags"><span class="badge badge-low">BIOGRAPHICAL</span></div><div class="expanded-file"><a href="read/purpose.html">Read</a> · <a href="files/Purpose.docx">Download</a></div></div></td>

This framework emphasizes removing barriers to involvement and providing meaningful, flexible opportunities for families to engage with schools and support student learning.<div class="expanded-tags"><span class="badge badge-low">EDUCATION</span></div><div class="expanded-file"><a href="read/88-5-action.html">Read</a> · <a href="files/88-5%20Action.docx">Download</a></div></div></td>

Don notes these signals appear in people&#x27;s everyday conversations and coffee-club discussions, suggesting grassroots support for change. He maintains his core message that the education system needs overhaul due to narrow focus, bureaucracy, and lack of accountability, while emphasizing that PEI citizens desire students to be independent learners capable of working and playing together.<div class="expanded-tags"><span class="badge badge-low">EDUCATION</span> <span class="badge badge-low">INSTITUTIONAL</span></div><div class="expanded-file"><a href="read/88-4-d-action.html">Read</a> · <a href="files/88-4-D%20Action.docx">Download</a></div></div></td>

He explains that communities encourage and fund learning they deem valuable (medicine, mechanics, policing) and that while schools are purpose-built facilities, attending school does not guarantee good education.

He acknowledges having numerous ideas for organizational initiatives but recognizes constraints of his advancing age and directors&#x27; busy schedules. Based on organizational discussions, recent planning, and Tim McRoberts&#x27;s committee work, Don reaffirms that PEI&#x27;s education system cannot independently institute needed 21st-century changes. He advocates for an active, broad-based, independent, member-driven organization of Islanders invested in education quality. Don identifies structural barriers to change: clarity of mission, structure, communication, autonomy, and accountability. He notes that bureaucracy and &quot;the fear factor&quot; hamper educational progress. Don outlines potential Education 20/20 roles (research, information, instruction, professional development) and indicates he will support whatever organizational direction the board chooses.

Don synthesizes frameworks from UNICEF, UNESCO, OECD, and the World Bank to define quality education comprehensively. The paper argues that quality education requires healthy learners supported by families, safe environments, relevant curricula, child-centered teaching approaches, and outcomes linked to national goals and social participation. Don advocates for autonomy in schools and independent assessment services, drawing on international research suggesting greater school autonomy correlates with student performance. The document demonstrates his synthesis of global best practices for PEI application.<div class="expanded-tags"><span class="badge badge-low">EDUCATION</span></div><div class="expanded-file"><a href="read/07-quality-education-rev.html">Read</a> · <a href="files/07%20Quality%20Education%20-%20Rev.docx">Download</a></div></div></td>

Features Dr. Don Glendenning, President of Education 20/20, advocating for reframing education as a service industry focused on helping learners acquire coping and thriving skills. Glendenning emphasizes that OECD and UNICEF quality recommendations—though low-cost—are largely ignored. Notes institutional reforms occurring elsewhere: rethinking high-stakes testing, introducing continuous progress, replacing school grades with achievement levels, establishing external assessment bodies, and recognizing school autonomy and accountability as improvement drivers. Suggests that if institutions don&#x27;t change, people will seek help elsewhere and proposes funding services rather than institutions. Describes Education 20/20 Inc. as an independent, broad-based nonprofit focused on improving education quality for all Canadians.

The document catalogs multiple concerns: PEI&#x27;s unsatisfactory PISA scores, low literacy rates, declining enrollment in adult basic education, employer-reported skill shortages, and parent/grandparent disappointment. Key conclusions state that diplomas/degrees are unreliable achievement measures, grading is not a school function, and current organization likely duplicates adult education services.

Don articulates his operating beliefs, including that each person is responsible for their own education, the home is the major contributor to education, and institutions&#x27; importance in acquiring education is declining. He identifies specific tools for educational change (instruction, opportunity, role models, counseling) and barriers (politicization, bureaucracy, inertia). Notably, he asserts that awarding credentials and qualifications is not an educational function and creates conflicts of interest. The framework emphasizes characteristics of quality education systems: accessibility, affordability, flexibility, relevance, accountability, transparency, and focus on helping individuals change.<div class="expanded-tags"><span class="badge badge-low">EDUCATION</span></div><div class="expanded-file"><a href="read/about-educ.html">Read</a> · <a href="files/About%20Educ.docx">Download</a></div></div></td>

Don presents his systemic framework: 140,000 Islander learners requiring support across the life journey; providers including families, communities, and institutions; and essential educational services (information, instruction, financing, governance, evaluation, accountability). He introduces Education 20/20&#x27;s &quot;Call for Action&quot; with seven recommendations: develop clear educational vision for all Islanders, create learner-centered service model, establish government leadership role, delegate instructional provision, establish independent qualification body, adopt professional service delivery model, and encourage innovation.

He documents communication gaps between education providers and receivers, argues that curriculum-based outcomes reflect educator thinking rather than learner needs, and identifies structural impediments including lack of overarching philosophy and no formal coordination among math providers. Recommendations include competency adoption, universal curriculum platforms, independent study options, dynamic rating scales, competency-based reporting, and independent assessment bodies.

He questions why those who teach should award credentials, as this creates incentive misalignment. Don proposes a provocative interim measure—issuing credentials on &quot;evaporating&quot; paper valid only 10 days after graduation—to highlight the absurdity of static credentials. He argues that an independent agency should award all degrees and diplomas, separating teaching from credentialing functions.<div class="expanded-tags"><span class="badge badge-low">BIOGRAPHICAL</span></div><div class="expanded-file"><a href="read/2015-ranking-students.html">Read</a> · <a href="files/2015%20Ranking%20students.doc">Download</a></div></div></td>

Proposes mountain-climbing framework emphasizing mathematics as prerequisite for later-life opportunities. Outlines mathematical structure: numeracy through infinite series. Advocates for complete field analysis before establishing levels. Proposes linkage with PISA or OECD levels and independent assessment service model similar to music and skating certification. Project plan: establish committee, undertake analysis, establish levels, conduct national consultation, distribute widely. Benefits include common standards, mobility support, and reduced curriculum workload.

He proposes that outcomes-based education (OBE) model adoption should logically lead to report cards that summarize pursued outcomes, achieved levels, remaining work, new outcomes, identified cautions or deficiencies with remediation plans, and new instructions for students and parents.

Attendees identified a disconnect between schools and communities, including low engagement, poor event attendance, voting participation gaps, and limited communication. Workshop opened with Community Foundation survey findings on Island youth concerns (health, education, employment, well-being) presented by Steve McQuaid and Katherine MacDonald. Don Glendenning chaired the session and advocated for CBC Compass to create a regular education slot. Workshop was part of Education 20/20&#x27;s ongoing community dialogue initiative.<div class="expanded-tags"><span class="badge badge-low">EDUCATION</span></div><div class="expanded-file"><a href="read/7-2014-summerside-workshop.html">Read</a> · <a href="files/7-2014-Summerside%20workshop.docx">Download</a></div></div></td>

He contends that education systems constrain teacher professionalism by dictating what, when, where, and how teachers work, suppressing individual creativity and accountability, and proposes that enabling teacher professionalism would increase high performance.<div class="expanded-tags"><span class="badge badge-low">BIOGRAPHICAL</span></div><div class="expanded-file"><a href="read/3-teacher-pay.html">Read</a> · <a href="files/3%20Teacher%20pay.doc">Download</a></div></div></td>

He opens with John Dewey&#x27;s principle: &quot;Relate the school to life, and all studies are of necessity correlated.&quot; Don frames education around six life roles (Oregon Education Act 1991) and argues schools should prepare students for acceptable performance in each role. He emphasizes that the clearer schools specify exit performance expectations, the more likely learners achieve them. Schools should look to communities—not disciplines—when planning programs. Don values schools as safe environments for experimentation while questioning society&#x27;s clarity about educational expectations.<div class="expanded-tags"><span class="badge badge-low">EDUCATION</span></div><div class="expanded-file"><a href="read/mission-statement.html">Read</a> · <a href="files/Mission%20statement.doc">Download</a></div></div></td>

He applies organizational principles to education: &quot;form follows function,&quot; requiring functional analysis and organizational alignment. He identifies education&#x27;s functions as governance, financing, delivery, human resources, and information. The Department lacks clear, measurable purpose—its 1989 philosophy statement is outdated with unmeasurable goals. Leadership needs a short, clear statement repeated consistently. Additionally, the Department masquerades as serving &quot;education&quot; while focusing solely on schooling, limiting students to opportunities it conceives and manages rather than fostering broader learning opportunities.<div class="expanded-tags"><span class="badge badge-low">BIOGRAPHICAL</span></div><div class="expanded-file"><a href="read/d-18-management-problem.html">Read</a> · <a href="files/D-18%20Management%20problem%20%20.doc">Download</a></div></div></td>

He credits this diverse background as preparation for founding Holland College in 1969. The piece articulates his conviction that educational change must come from public demand rather than from within the system. He published his first Guardian letter in 1995 and compiled approximately 62 published letters over 18 years, viewing this collection as stimulus for public discussion and debate about educational reform.

Using teaching as example, credentials are university degrees while qualifications are teaching licenses. He discusses three assessment purposes: formative (helping learning), summative (establishing achievement level), and ranking. Argues teachers should focus on formative assessment (coaching role) but summative testing creates conflict of interest, as teachers serve both as coaches and referees/judges of their own students. Suggests roles should be separated professionally.

Notes autonomy effectiveness depends on accountability mechanisms - schools with autonomy plus public accountability show better performance than those without accountability structures. Defines autonomy as freedom to allocate resources, hire/dismiss teachers, formulate budgets, make curriculum/assessment decisions. Examines PEI principals&#x27; limited autonomy despite Schools Act designation as educational leaders.

Schooling refers to formal institutional training. Donald argues these terms are confused in contemporary discourse.

He argues the kind of education provided determines the nation&#x27;s future. Don criticizes the current system as impervious to change, overly bureaucratic, hierarchical, and based on outdated industrial structures. He notes people both inside and outside education are calling for reform, arguing the climate for change has never been better. However, systems are incapable of self-change and require external intervention—the purpose of his remarks.<div class="expanded-tags"><span class="badge badge-low">EDUCATION</span></div><div class="expanded-file"><a href="read/masthead.html">Read</a> · <a href="files/Masthead.doc">Download</a></div></div></td>

Don supports external educational competitions and recognition but opposes internal school ranking.

He positions technology as neutral discipline—like social studies, communications, mathematics—rather than vocational-specific. Don argues a course&#x27;s vocational character derives from learner purpose (employment-seeking) rather than content; physics becomes vocational when pursued for employment preparation. He advocates secondary schools maintain technology alongside business, visual arts, health sciences, and applied arts courses. Technology clusters could encompass computers, fabrication, electronics, design, mechanics, energy. Don&#x27;s critical insight: a course&#x27;s academic or vocational character depends on instructor approach, not content. Physics taught academically differs from vocational physics through methodology and emphasis, not curriculum. This perspective challenged prevailing stigmatization of vocational education and positioned technology as respectable curriculum area accessible to all students regardless of post-secondary intent.<div class="expanded-tags"><span class="badge badge-low">EDUCATION</span></div><div class="expanded-file"><a href="read/technology-education.html">Read</a> · <a href="files/Technology%20EDUCATION.doc">Download</a></div></div></td>

He notes that PISA results have replaced community standards, and laments the loss of specific institutions (PVI and PCVH). Don advocates for system review addressing: common definitions glossary, stated program purposes, conceptual clarity, assessment methods, autonomy and accountability definitions, collaboration between providers and users, universal rating scales, informative transcripts, and recognition of learning context importance.

He notes International Baccalaureate, Red Cross, PISA, P-CAP, and qualification authorities all use &quot;level&quot; terminology for achievement. Renaming would allow students to pursue different subjects at different levels (Grade 11 student simultaneously at Level 7 Math, Level 4 Physics, Level 6 Literature).

Key themes include: (1) education is a service requiring skilled, autonomous providers; (2) education and schooling must be distinguished; (3) education services (information, counselling, instruction, quality assurance, products/technology, funding, human resources) should be explicitly organized and universally available; (4) structural issues include communication gaps, unclear purpose, service identification, autonomy/accountability, and reporting student progress; (5) professional development and qualification authorities require attention. Don critiques treating going to school as equivalent to education and advocates for community participation in education governance.

The document establishes foundational premises: that future community well-being depends on citizen education quality, that learning is personal, and that education is a service focused on arranging beneficial experiences. Don proposes seven major structural reforms: expanding departmental scope beyond youth to serve all Islanders, establishing clear terminology, articulating explicit educational purpose, clarifying service offerings, restructuring to reflect function rather than age-groups, granting operational autonomy to front-line workers (citing OECD evidence), and implementing accountability frameworks based on clarity, communication, and trust.

Don Glendenning defines learning, teaching, and education with clarity and precision. He argues all PEI residents are potential learners who seek measurable change in knowledge, skills, attitudes, or values. Learners bring three elements to education: inherent physical/mental/emotional conditions; prior experiences from varied sources; and personal aspirations. Don defines learning as changing what one knows, feels, believes, and can do; teaching as arranging experiences enabling such change; and education as resulting from meaningful experiences. He notes that being &quot;well-educated&quot; means handling everyday life issues competently. Critically, Don rejects the conflation of school attendance with education—the World Bank warns this is problematic. He observes PEI educators lack shared definitions, potentially reflecting mission uncertainty, struggles with contemporary changes, and unclear educational services. He recommends reviewing common terminology, adopting shared definitions, implementing low-key systemic changes, ensuring conceptual clarity, and reconsidering educational goals and lifelong learning integration.<div class="expanded-tags"><span class="badge badge-low">BIOGRAPHICAL</span></div><div class="expanded-file"><a href="read/learning-1.html">Read</a> · <a href="files/Learning-1.docx">Download</a></div></div></td>

Identifies background challenges: IT skills are critical for modern economy but expensive and difficult for schools to maintain current technology, teachers struggle to keep up, school time is limited, parents cannot keep current, and equipment sits unused after hours/weekends. Proposes training in local communities for children and young adults outside normal school hours and during summer. Options include credit or non-credit offerings, after-hours school facilities, library-based delivery, and fee-based or sponsored funding. Discusses integration approaches: 20/20 could secure funding and hire staff, or find funding and contract with providers. Raises implementation questions about Education 20/20&#x27;s charitable status, whether IT training aligns with organizational priorities, and whether it conflicts with or supports core mission.

Policy analysis notes on objectives for proposed non-profit legislation, likely PEI-focused. Document outlines six core objectives: (1) public education and policy advocacy through newsletters, websites, and papers; (2) monitoring education systems and analyzing compliance with research/best practices; (3) engaging parents and communities through workshops on essential skills, learning frameworks, and educational models; (4) supporting learner-centered activities; (5) professional development for educators; (6) organizational growth and sustainability. Detailed budget line items indicate Don&#x27;s involvement in advocacy organization planning. Workshops mentioned suggest he envisioned Education 20/20 (referenced elsewhere in batch) as platform for community education. Notes reflect Don&#x27;s philosophy of systematic public engagement, research-based advocacy, and educator professional development - core themes throughout his career.<div class="expanded-tags"><span class="badge badge-low">EDUCATION</span></div><div class="expanded-file"><a href="read/notes-based-on-objectives-proposed-for-new-non-profit-act.html">Read</a> · <a href="files/Notes%20based%20on%20Objectives%20proposed%20for%20new%20Non%20Profit%20Act.docx">Download</a></div></div></td>
