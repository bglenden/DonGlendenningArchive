<p><span><b>For immediate release</b></span></p>
<p><span><b>School engagement</b></span></p>
<p><span><b></b></span><br></p>
<p>A couple of months from now an Island school or learning centre will receive a cheque for $2,500, and they can spend it for whatever they want.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They will receive the award because of the nature and<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>extent to which students are engaged in learning activities, and the engagement of parents and other community members as well.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And all this happens because of there is a<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>positive relationship between engagement and learning.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Engagement comes in many forms like the Future Local Forums for Grade 9 French students, the Junior Achievement activities in Kinkora; a translation service for newcomers, quality of communications between home and school, cross cultural events and the use of technology.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is not simply a matter of a teacher and a class, it involves a school wide initiative of diffwrent classes, even different ages, working together and working with other members of their community. The range of activities reflects the interests and skills in the community.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Schools aren’t all expected to do the same thing but they must do things, not just because they received extra money for a project, but they know it is good for learning and the community.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>This award is made possible because of the generosity of an Island family that also believes that engagement and achievement go hand in hand.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Education 20/20 has identified five kinds of engagement, student to student, student to teacher, student to learning material, student to community, and parent involvement; and there are likely others.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Anyone can nominate a school or learning centre; further information and forms are available at www.education2020.ca. But act soon.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Nominations close on March 29 and the school or learning centre that wins the award could have its $2,500 cheque in May. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
