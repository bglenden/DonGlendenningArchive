  Unresolved Questions
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">(98 words):** Don distills a lifetime of educational reflection into eight fundamental unresolved questions challenging system assumptions. Why are current graduation requirements optimal? Why ignore teacher performance in compensation? What justifies institutional credentialing? Why exclude non-school learning? Why force group learning when learning is individual? Why limit preparation to further education? How justify grade failures when grades serve administrative convenience? Why emphasize unmeasurable outcomes over demonstrable competencies? These questions reveal Don&#x27;s core concerns: evidence-based policy, performance accountability, holistic learning recognition, individualized pacing, practical life preparation, and measurable assessment. The list encapsulates his career-long systematic critique of educational contradictions between stated goals and operational practices.</div>

<p>Even after a lifetime in education, many questions remain.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Here a re a few:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Where is the evidence that our current set of graduation requirements are the best set we can devise?</p>
<p>Why do teacher pays systems ignore performance?</p>
<p>What is the basis for teaching institutions awarding credentials?</p>
<p>Why do we recognize learning inside a school to the exclusion of learning which occurs elsewhere?</p>
<p>Iif learning is an individual matter why do we allocate so much times to learning in groupls?</p>
<p>If learning is intended to prepare students for life why do school s limit themselves to preparing learners for further education?</p>
<p>How can one fail a grade when grades are only a mechanism of administrative convenience?</p>
<p>Why do schools shun competencies in favour of outcomes which are largely unmeasureable?</p>
