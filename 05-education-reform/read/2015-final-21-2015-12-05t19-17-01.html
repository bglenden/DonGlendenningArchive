<p><b>2015 Final</b></p>
<p><b>Question 11-a</b></p>
<p><b>QUESTION 11A –PURPOSES AND ACTIVITIES</b></p>
<p><b>For application to CRA for charitable status</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>APPROVED PURPOSES</b></p>
<p>The purposes of Education 20/20 Inc., as included in our incorporation documents, are as follows:</p>
<p>1 To promote education and educational opportunity for every Canadian</p>
<p>2 To exercise leadership in the improvement in all facets of education</p>
<p>3 To foster cooperation between and among all stakeholders</p>
<p>4 Undertake and support research and innovation</p>
<p>5 improve public understanding of the education system</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>As part of the process of preparing this application, however, we reviewed and revised the objectives as found in our incorporation documents to better reflect our interests and plans; the objectives and activities included below result from that review.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>A)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><b>ADVANCE EDUCATION BY ORGANIZING LEADERSHIP DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES FOR PEOPLE WHO PLAN, ADMINISTER AND DELIVER EDUCATION PROGRAMS.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>Education 20/20 is well positioned to engage educators from across all sectors, to provide them with opportunities to learn about new education innovation from around the world, share best practices and with this new knowledge, advance education programming to the benefit of learners from birth through to the workforce.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>To this end, education 20/20 has undertaken or planned the following activities.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span><b>Recent Workshops</b></span></p>
<p>Education 20/20 offered the following workshops held in the late afternoon or<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>early evening; workshops were designed to maximize engagement and normally commence with an opening speech or panel presentation; all allowed for questions from the audience and some sessions included facilitated discussions, making of notes and reporting back to participants.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Rooms are usually arranged to accommodate 6-8 people at tables; some sessions, but not all, included IT support.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>For early workshops, Education 20/20 provided coffee and juice but neither proved popular so now we only provide bottled water.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Whenever possible, we find facilities available courtesy of a government, local NGO or volunteer agency; handouts are distributed at some sessions (Stratford Town Hall, Go eland Centre, Credit Union Place, and Access Centres).</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Community Engagement and Early Childhood Learning<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p>This session was led by Alice Taylor as lead-off speaker and Anne Miller, Kim Watts and Brenda Goodine as panelists; it was held at the Haviland Club on December 4, 2012 (Announcement and press clipping included with supporting documents)</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Framework for Learning<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><span>The workshop was held at the Quality Inn, Charlottetown, on October 21, 2013 and included presentations by </span>Alice Taylor, PEI partner of Handle with Care Program, Eileen Conway-Martin, Communications Director, Native Council of PEI, and Brenda Goodine, Learning Manager, Early Childhood Education, Holland College.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Don Glendenning, President Emeritus of Holland College was chair the session. <span>(Announcement and press clipping sent with supporting documents)</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>From a Learner’s Perspective</b>,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>A workshop about learning<span> </span>was held on October 22, 2014 in the Stratford Town Hall.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The evening started with a youth panel (Callen Cudmore, Ryan Rioux, Iain Cudmore and Stephanie Mayne)<b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b> identifying the kinds of help they considered most useful when learning new things. The room was provided free of charge by the Town of Stratford; the panel was chaired by Tanya Craig, a Director of Education 20/20 Inc. The local McDonalds provided a free meal coupon to each panelist.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Mike Chapman, a volunteer, recorded student comments and, later facilitated discussions to refine the list.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Later the results were brought together in the form of a “Learning Path”, refined at a workshop with students in the Early Childhood Teacher Education Program at Holland College.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>(Announcement and press clipping sent with supporting documents) <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The initiative generated considerable interest and an additional session was held on May14 at the Haviland Club with about 35 participants present; those present included senior educators, President of the Prince Edward Island Home and School Federation, retired educators, parents and the public at large. An enlarged copy of “A Learning Path” was placed on a tripod as a focus. The Chair facilitated a round table discussion. Following the meeting, minor adjustments were made to the document; it was posted on our website and published as an occasional paper.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>(See supporting documents)</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Dialogues with Educators</b></p>
<p>Small groups were convened in informal setting to discuss issues of interest; the first was held on Wednesday, January 21, 2014 at the Haviland Club in Charlottetown.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Guest educator of the evening was Dr. Tammy Hubley-Little, leader of Curriculum Development for the English Language School Board.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Dr. Hubley-Little made a presentation on Student Achievement followed by questions and discussion.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Fifteen people participated including a university Professor of Education, the Head of Early Childhood Teacher Education at Holland College, several graduate students, a teacher of on-line courses, a retired Superintendent and a Reading Specialist. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>A Bridge to New Careers:</b></p>
<p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A presentation by Mr. Gerry Seaward, Director of Adult Basic Education Program at Holland College was held in the Stratford Town Hall.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Adult Basic Education is an inclusive term covering instruction to students who, for the most part, are high school graduates but who lack credits needed for entrance to university or Holland College. Perhaps the most interesting part of the presentation was the statistics showing that classes not only had increased their grades from previous years but had actually reduced the number of days to complete the course. participants were provided<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>an outline so<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>that they could follow the presentation.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>(See supporting documents)</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Teaching and Learning for a Complex World</b></p>
<p>Originally entitled “The State of On-line Courses”, Dave Cormier, Project lead for Student Relations Management at the University of Prince Edward Island made a presentation on “rhizomatic learning”.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Cormier has an international reputation in educational innovation and is on an international travel circuit promoting his views on the subject.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Cormier responded to questions from the audience during his presentation and later participated in the give and take of an open discussion. The session lasted nearly two hours and there were no handouts.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Planned workshops</b></p>
<p>Commitments have been made, but dates not yet confirmed, for the following workshops:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Handle With Care</b></p>
<p><span>Handle with Care is a national program designed to help parents and other caregivers promote the mental health of young children every day.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is useful for everyone who cares for or works with children; especially parents, grandparents and teachers, and consists of sets of interactive strategies that build on the strengths of adults in their daily lives.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span></span>The program is based on four building blocks: <span>Trust and Attachment, Building and Enhancing Self- Esteem, Expressing Emotions and Building Relationships with Others.</span><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Each block builds upon the one before and contains the following components: Key message, Research, Activities, Bringing it Home and Bringing it Together, other resources and a Summary Handout. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The key to a successful program is trained facilitators.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Each participant is required to purchase a text book.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Handle with Care was developed by Hincks Delcrest Centre in Toronto and the Canadian Mental Health Association and with funding from public Health Agency of Canada.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was piloted with 439 participants in four centres, two in Ontario and one each in Prince Edward Island and Manitoba.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The developers of the program promote and allow its use but insist on trained facilitators.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Ms. Taylor was a member of the original team supervised the testing process in PEI and is involved in its implementation in Nova Scotia; PEI has at least two fully trained facilitators and a number of others with some training.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>A Handle with Care workshop for parents and caregivers of young children is planned for Hunter River, PEI. however, Ms. Taylor, session leader, is recovering from surgery and a date has not been finalized.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The workshop in Hunter River will be hosted by Rochelle Shephard and the Early Learning Centre.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span><b>Most Likely to Succeed:</b></span><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The film, Most Likely to Succeed, is a recent film by<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Ted Dintersmith, an educational<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>philanthropist, and shows project based learning at High Tech High in San Diego, California.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Mr. Dintersmith is currently on a personal tour launching the film across the USA.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Our screening is scheduled for Sunday, January 17, 2016 from 2-4:00 pm. At the City Cinema, 64 King Street, Charlottetown, PEI</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Research Findings on Youth</b></p>
<p>The session will include a presentation followed by questions and discussions Dr. Kate Tilleczek, Chair, Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council Research Lab at UPEI – Date not yet confirmed</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Public School Support Services</b></p>
<p>A public presentation by Derek McEwen, Director of English Programs, English Language School Board, and colleagues from the Department of Education, Early Learning, and Culture.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The session was originally scheduled for November 2015, but Mr. McEwen has asked for a postponement. The session will include both a formal presentation and question and answer period, and a display of resource materials; the session will be open to the public.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Education Award</b></p>
<p>Thanks to a generous Islander, an award for Excellence in Education is made to an Island School or Early Learning Centre. Each year Education 20/20 calls for nominations for its Excellence in Education Award; the first two focused on engagement, the 2016 Award is for Excellence in the application of technology. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Terms of reference are prepared, nominations are solicited both through our mail out and notices distributed to all schools by the Department of Education, Earling and Culture; In mid to late May nominations are reviewed by a committee and with a recommendation to the Directors.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The Award for Excellence in Education for 2015 went to Prince Street Elementary School; an announcement about the 2016 award is included with the enclosed support material.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span><b>Webinars</b></span></p>
<p>There is a large unserved and even growing body of people engaged in education outside public institutions; I refer to a dozen agencies on PEI part of whose educational programs have been accepted by the Department of Education for external credits, some private schools, home schooling parents, employer based training and a number of organizations receiving funding to mount programs for underserved youth.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Education 20/20 Inc. plans to offer a series of webinar-style 3-5 minute video clips for use by educators either alone or in groups.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Our first series, “A Learning Framework” is under development and consists of four sessions (1) Learners which provides background as to why learners differ, (2) Learning: sheds light on what happens when a person learns, (3) Levels of Learning: presents options on the meaning of levels of achievement, and (4) The Learning Path which follows a learner through a learning cycle.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Involved in the first series are: Presenter Donald Glendenning, CM, PhD; Henry Purdy, CM, CRA, and Sara Underwood, Office of Alumni Relations at Holland College.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This activity is on hold until we find additional resources.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span><b>Work with employers:</b></span></p>
<p>On 2013, the Community Foundation of Prince Edward Island conducted a survey of over 200 young people to better understand their issues.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>(<span>www.cfpei.ca</span>). On reviewing their report, Education 20/20 was struck by the “preparedness gap”, that is the statement that many young people find a gap in the extent to which their previous education prepared for further education and for work. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Early in 2014, Education 20/20 Inc. organized workshops in six communities across the Island to publicize the findings, determine the extent of the concern, and identify actions, if any, that could or should be taken. Perhaps the most significant finding was the lack of communication about educational matters between providers and users of educational services.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>On the other side of the issue, employers and post-secondary institutions use high school graduation as an entrance requirement to further study and to work, but they are finding that having such a high school graduation diploma is no longer adequate evidence of an acceptable level of basic or essential skills.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This is not surprising since teachers often report that in most classes, student grade levels range from 2-3 grade levels above to 2-3 grade levels below the nominal level of the class.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In other words, it is not unusual to have students whose math levels range by six to 8 years. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>On November 25, 2015 Education 20/20 convened a meeting that included Representatives of the Department of Education, Early Learning and Culture, the English Language School Board, Holland College, UPEI, PEI Literacy Council, the Community Foundation and employers in the Board room of Ellis and Birt, 27 Brackley Point Road, Charlottetown.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The purpose was to explore the issue of the gap referred to earlier in this document. It soon became evident that public school educators do not consult with the public they serve when planning school programs; furthermore preparing students for citizenship, let alone for employment is not a stated purpose of schools.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Employers, on the other hand, have not identified their needs especially in the area of basic education.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Further sessions have the potential as an instrument of educational improvement but to do so may well challenge the views of all parties represented.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The initiative is important and will continue. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><b>Other providers of educational services</b></p>
<p>We are familiar with schools, colleges and universities as providers of educational services; we are less familiar with, and often overlook, the many other providers such as youth organizations, cadet programs, sports development programs, the private sector and a range of NGO’s.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>More to the point, staff in these groups is seldom included in conferences, workshops or other educational activities.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We have made contact with a number of community based training agencies such as <span>Skills PEI</span>, <span>Workplace Learning PEI</span>, <span>Bridges </span>and some private trainers; some already participate in current activities of Education 20/20.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>With the initiative by the Department of Education to increase credit for external courses, we see an increased opportunity and an obligation to help.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Although the dialogue is open, we have not undertaken yet any programs specifically designed to meet their needs. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Assessment and Evaluation</b></p>
<p>Schools not only certify they also sort; by sorting we mean issue credentials (Diplomas and Degrees).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Some see the issue an inadequate standard- setting and assessment model while others simply believe that schools have should not be in the business of sorting and grading people they teach. It appears that s need exists for assessment services. Education 20/20 is exploring the idea of a separate certification arrangement similar to that provided by the Royal Canadian Conservatory of Music under which teachers teach but the Conservatory certifies.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In the broader context, I should point out that most advanced countries have developed qualification bodies to deal with both, perhaps even rationalize national mobility and well as that of people who work internationally; Canada and the US are exceptions.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The idea of an independent assessment service or qualification authority is gaining support and, we expect, will soon become centre stage in the movement to improve public education. We continue to develop the idea and see a feasibility study on the horizon.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>B) ADVANCE EDUCATION THROUGH INCREASING THE AMOUNT AND FLOW OF INFORMATION AND IDEAS TO, BETWEEN AND AMONG EDUCATION PARTNERS</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>Society must draw from the shared knowledge, experiences and aspirations of citizens to maximize the achievement of learners and to better support them throughout their lives.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Achieving this goal requires greater connectivity among education partners that include students, parents, teachers, principals, government, government and education, community and business organizations.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>It takes an informed and engaged community to educate a child; evidence shows that students perform better in schools with a high degree of autonomy but also in schools where parents and the community work together; in PEI, during the last few months, the Department of Education has dramatically expanded the number of external credits.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Education 20/20 <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>believes that more needs to be done and that our organization can play an important role in (1) increasing the flow of information and (2) providing opportunities for “deliverers of educational services and “users of educational services” to dialogue.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The connectivity among education partners on PEI is currently limited due in large part to jurisdictional boundaries, for example among provincial government departments, between school boards, among educators in the early years, K-12 and postsecondary<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>systems and those involved in workforce skill development.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Education 20/20 is working to reduce these boundaries, to enable education partners to come together with a shared sense of purpose and direction on learning.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This information sharing should enable improved decision making within all education and learning sectors that will ultimately be to the benefit of all learners. To this end, Education 20/20 has undertaken or planned the following activities.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Education 20/20 Newsletter</b></p>
<p>Open Education, is distributed electronically on a monthly basis to some 250 people in both official languages.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>(Copies included with supporting documents)</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Education 20/20 Website</b>,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>A new website, <span>www.education2020.ca</span>, was launched to announce events, post occasional papers, host newsletters and survey results; this website will become a centre for managing our information activities including social media.<span><b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></span></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Conversation/dialogue</b></p>
<p>One of the conclusions resulting from our preparedness workshops mentioned elsewhere in this paper is the need for direct dialogue between education and the community it serves.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>To bridge the gap, we are organizing a series of discussions; each session will have a one page background paper, a presentation if appropriate, and an open discussion.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The objective is to increase communications rather than to reach agreement.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The most appropriate time is still uncertain, and we propose to try different time slots, perhaps noon in a community centre, afternoon coffees, 4:30 and 6:00 pm to catch people on the way home and evening sessions as well is difficult for parents with young children, 7:00 pm with a group not to exceed 20 people; additional groups will be organized if numbers warrant. (Copy of invitation included with supporting documents)</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Formal presentations</b></p>
<p>It is important help policy makers become aware and up- to- date on issues about which they make policies.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In saying this, we are aware of, and have reviewed Policy CPS-022 (Effective date: September 2, 2003), and understand the limits placed on charitable organizations especially as they relate to lobbying and political activities, however, we believe there is<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>need to provide decision makers with<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>both information and alternatives and, consequently, will seek opportunities to address various bodies such as such as the Provincial Cabinet, the French Language School Board, Chambers of Commerce and Council of Maritime Premiers, MPHEC and others.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>English Language School Board</b></p>
<p>On September 25, 2014 Education 20/20 Inc. made a presentation to the English language School Board on <span>Prior Learning Assessment and Recognition</span> during which we advocated for exemptions and challenge for credits as ways of broadening studies, putting students in charge of at least some elements of their program, and increasing engagement.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>(Copy of presentation included with enclosed documents)</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Prince Edward Island Standing Committee on Education and Innovation</b></p>
<p>On September 30, 2014, Education 20/20 Inc. made a presentation to the Prince Edward Island Standing Committee on Education and Innovation on A <span>Framework for Decision-making</span>. (Copy included with enclosed documents)<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Workforce and Advanced Learning</b></p>
<p>A Presentation to the Minister of Workforce and Advanced Learning: took place in the Minister’s office on Monday, November 23, 2015 with his Deputy Minister in attendance.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The presentation was informal and included a brief overview of the work of Education 20/20 Inc., concerns about the absence of a national qualification authority, need for part time courses, support for independent learners, and the importance of training for first line supervisors.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Working with the Community at Large</b></p>
<p>Parents play a pivotal role in the education of their children; children perform better when their parents and the community are engaged in the education process and yet, broadly speaking, the school system does not encourage deep engagement.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>To encourage engagement, Education 20/20 Inc. has instituted an award of Excellence to a school or learning centre that best demonstrates a high level of engagement in its day to day activities, especially those activities over which the school has control.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is anticipated that this award will encourage parents, teachers, students and principals to think about new ways to interact and engage one another to the benefit of learning and learners. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We will continue to engage employers and educators in projects and panels to increase communication; service clubs will be encouraged to invite educators, especially principals, as speakers, and will make a special attempt to produce occasional papers and media releases about items of interest to them. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>(C) ADVANCE EDUCATION BY PROVIDING SUPPLEMENTAL EDUCATIONAL SUPPORT SERVICES</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>Learning begins at birth, continues through the early years, through the K-12 school system, postsecondary education and into the workforce.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Every citizen is at one point or another, a learner.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Education is a lifelong process; most of our educational funding, however, goes to institutions and for full-time instruction of the young.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Even at that, schools cannot, should not be expected to, supply all educational services for youth; neither can governments be expected to pay all educational costs.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There is a need for part time instruction and short courses but, even where they are available, offerings tends be limited to courses being offered to others on a full time basis.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Although technology has put knowledge building within easy reach of many adults, maintaining and progressing in the workplace may also require new skills and attitudes that can best be dealt with in group settings.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Partners in the education process also include the family, community agencies, sports groups, service clubs, NGO’s, private sector, and individuals, to name but a few; future plans of Education 20/20 include:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Study Centre(s)</b></p>
<p>Many students need a place to study, to meet with a tutor, to access occasional help and to interact with other learners; Education 20/20 plans to provide such places.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As demand for services grow, we see the need for a full service study centre where youth can get customized help such as counselling, diagnosis, assessment and even referral. Our longer term plan is to expand the service to number communities as demand builds and resources allow.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>At least at the beginning, tutors will be volunteers; initial space has been offered by the PEI Association of Professional Engineers; costs will be minimal and will be met through donations from individuals and businesses.</p>
<p><br></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li5"><b>Emerging fields</b> –<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
</ul>
<p>Our world is dominated by technology.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Most computer users benefit from less than 10% of a program’s functionality.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There are contemporary computer languages that are learnable by virtually anyone.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Knowledge of a computer language not only helps us better use existing programs, but also enables us to start building some of our own tools thereby changing us from passive to active technology consumers.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Schools cannot be expected to meet the emerging demands by all students, in all new fields and in all locations. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We need to open doors to more people, especially young people. At the moment, interest appears to be centered on coding but robotics, 3D printing and other IT related areas are also in demand.</p>

<p><span>At the moment, school r</span>eorganization is consuming most of the energy of educators in PEI, however, the Minister has announced new funding in support of technology in schools and even the introduction of coding into schools<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>One of our Directors serves on the Minister’s Information Technology Advisory Committee.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In addition, we see a growing interest in providing young children with computer skills outside the school system.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>At the moment, our role is limited to encouraging supporting such changes; however, other roles may emerge over time.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Success in school depends to a significant degree to the level of social and emotional development of people entering school; there is a need, we believe, to provide information and assistance to parents of pre-school students in ways to ensure young people are provided with appropriate experiences.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>At the moment, we are in active discussion with a view to offering the Handle-with-Care program, mentioned elsewhere in this document.</p>

  <li class="li5"><b>Imagine experiences</b></li>
</ul>
<p>In the hurly burly of everyday life, and especially in the context of school classrooms, there is seldom time for creativity.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We propose to provide such opportunities to Islanders of any age.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><span>T</span>he charting of a learning path was an “imagine activity”; the initiative started with a few students, a blank flip chart and the question “what kind of help do you want/need to support your learning?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Out of it came a number of discussions, a learning path and a clearer understanding of the conflict that arises when teachers also grade. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The next step will likely be a session to chart the role of teachers followed by “greenfield” projects for in which groups would be encouraged take on the design of a community “learning centre”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Participants would be given a minimum set of criteria outlining safety and legal requirements and left to use their imagination as to a design.</p>

<p><b>D)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>ADVANCE EDUCATION BY SUPPORTING RESEARCH AND INNOVATION, AND BY PROMOTING BEST PRACTICES IN THE FIELD OF EDUCATION AND TRAINING</b></p>
<p>Education 20/20 Inc. realizes the importance research and innovation and will encourage research and researchers through publicizing research findings, identifying and promoting underserved areas, and featuring researchers in our public sessions.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Existing research, it seems to us, focuses almost exclusively on institution based education, early childhood, the young and literacy. We believe that other issues also could benefit from additional research such as the role of credentials and qualifications, determining levels of achievement in key subjects, choice in education, delivery options, alternatives to age level grouping and continuing education.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Survey of Interests and needs</b></p>
<p>Education 20/20 has initiated on-line public surveys to gather stakeholder views on the goals of public education as published on the Department of Education website. We start with goals because they are a basic direction- setting activity, and are the first step towards renewing the philosophy and vision of education for our Province.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Occasional papers</b></p>
<p>We plan a series of occasional papers, short papers on issues related to any aspect of education.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Papers may report research findings, best practices, innovations, and points of view.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Papers will be aimed at the general public and be widely available electronically.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Occasional papers provide information and views on a variety of subjects but also provide an opportunity, and even encouragement, to people to clarify their views and “grow’ in their chosen field. The first is a brief report on a series of workshops held throughout the Province earlier this year. Another, on Charter Schools, arises from a request following a public meeting, a third responds at least in part, to providing a framework making decisions about education.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>(Copies of some papers, not yet released, are included with our supporting documents). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Assessment</b></p>
<p>We continue our exploration of the role of assessment in the education process and concluded that, while formative assessment is a legitimate role for educational institutions, summative evaluation is not.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Our activities to date have been exploratory in nature: we find, for example (1) at the international level, neither Canada nor the USA have<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“qualification authorities, (b) Canadian education authorities tend to rely on input measures (what is taught, rather than output measures (what has been learned) for purposes of comparison and (3) there appears to be no widely recognized graduation document available that provided the information that employers need or want when making their decisions to accept or reject applications. We are still in the “information gathering” stage but expect to become more active in the coming months.</p>
