  2013-06 A Family educator
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Don proposes establishing independent educational advisors separate from school counselors. Drawing on Jan Hodges&#x27; Manchester Guardian article, he argues that just as families have doctors, accountants, and lawyers, they need educational advisors who can provide independent guidance to students, parents, and teachers on career and educational pathways. This would address a gap between school-based counseling and the broader lifelong learning needs of people of all ages.</div>

<p>Dear Sir:</p>
<p><b>A family adviser on education</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The process of getting an education is a complex one; it involves developing the knowledge, skills and attitudes that enable us to live a full and productive life; choices abound and each choice has its own consequences.<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Families have a family doctor, perhaps a financial advisor, often an accountant, sometimes a lawyer and perhaps other advisers, but when it comes to education, a much more complex field, learners and families are left on their own. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Jan Hodges (“Careers education needs to be an ongoing dialogue, in which information is discussed at every stage”, Manchester Guardian, Wednesday, May 29) identified the need to expand existing school-based counselling with “independent advice and guidance” about career education for 16-18 year-old youth; information would be directed not only to young people but also to their parents and teachers.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The need for advice on educational matters, however, exists well beyond careers and school walls; people of all ages could benefit from information, counseling, direction, advice and sometimes just an attentive ear.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Guidance counselors work with students in school; educational advisors would be available to anyone but would mostly serve people not in school. <span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></p>
