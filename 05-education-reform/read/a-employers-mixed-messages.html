  A Employers mixed messages 
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Don articulates his foundational premise that most young people can learn most school content, though some require additional time. He argues schools must shift from &quot;delivery mode&quot; to &quot;development mode&quot;—focusing on individual needs, interests and plans rather than standardized content pacing. Schools must adjust time and resources to learner needs; failure to reach standards cannot be blamed on home or community but indicates insufficient school services. Don expresses concern that graduates lack basic literacy and numeracy for further study or employment. He argues that while government runs schools and restricts competition, it owes Islanders explanation and action plans regarding educational quality.</div>

<p>Dear Sir:</p>
<p><b>Action expected<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I start from the premise that most young people can learn most things that schools offer although it may take some a little longer than others; if schools want to continue in the education business, they must switch from a delivery mode to a development mode.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A development mode means focusing on the individuals needs, interests and plans and marshalling the resources to help the learner achievement.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>volves starting with the individual an providing means having the capability to find a way to deliver what students need when they need it. adjust<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>schools must adjust time available to suit llearn to<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>failure to reach a desired standard cannot and should not be blamed on either the community or the home, but may require an adjustment in the nature or extent of services needed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Lack of support in the home or school may be a factor but is not an acceptable excuse.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Islanders want their schools to provide young people with a reasonable level of reading, writing and arithmetic skills; but they are of the view that that is not happening at the moment.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It appears that many young people are graduating from high school without the basic skills needed to access further studies or enter employment.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>we are putting limits on their futures. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The view must be valid because so far at least, government has not explained, denied or refuted this view.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If this were in any other field, Islanders would simply take their business elsewhere, and that is possible for the people who can afford it. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Islanders are concerned; they expect action and they also expect to be consulted. As long as government continues, not only to run schools, but to limit competition, it owes Islanders an explanation and a plan of action</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>This is likely as good a place as any to begin the improvement process.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
