Dear Sir,

In recent days, I have been part of several discussions about school closings. The most interesting
was a brief conversation with a stranger while waiting in line at a store. It turns out that he was a
teacher who found his way to a store at 8.00 am but was upset because school opening was only
delayed instead of school being cancelled. He was not looking forward to the day; the students
would not be in a good mood; they also wanted/expected schools to be cancelled.

School cancellation is based on a number of assumptions. One is that schooling and education are
the same; they&#x27;re not. Schooling is an important part of education but it is only a part. A second
assumption is that groups learn; they don&#x27;t. Only individuals learn although they may learn in a
group setting. In fact, some things can best be learned with others; but certainly not all. Finally,
we have assigned schools the responsibility of, not only what takes in place in school, but also
with transporting learners from their homes to a school of our choice.

I would like to comment on three elements of the school- closing issue. First is the matter of the
school buildings and physical resources within them. A schedule of school and resource
availability should be established and maintained. Yes, there will be instances when a building
may be closed because of emergency situations but only in genuine emergencies. A snowfall
andlor high winds is not sufficient reason, to my way of thinking, to close a school building unless
it is felt that the structure is likely to collapse causing danger to the people inside.

A separate decision needs to be made about which resources within a school should be open to
students when numbers are small or teachers are absent. Most study areas including
library/resource centres, classrooms, and computer labs could be opened to most students most of
the time; some study areas may have to be restricted.

With schools generally open, teachers will have to decide whether conditions allow them to reach
their place of work. It is an individual decision. Teachers living nearby, should have no problem;
those living at a distance from the school may miss some days. When teachers cannot keep to a
schedule, they should let their clients, the students, know. When a teacher accepts a teaching
post, there is a contract to provide a service and that contract should be honoured at all
reasonable cost. A staffing policy may be required to deal with teacher absences but closing a
school so that a teacher gets paid should not be an option.

The Government provides opportunity, encouragement, teachers and other resources to assist
students to obtain a quality education but only learners can learn. It is a responsibility of learners,
or their parents, to ensure that learners take advantage ofthe resources. Teachers certainly play a
role in motivating students&quot; Students make individual decisions about if what, when, how and
how much they learn; even when we are teaching, learners may be learning something quite
different from what is intended&quot;

As for transportation, there are at last two separate points of decision-making. People providing
the bus service, or the operators themselves, should decide whether or not it is safe to drive. If
conditions are unsafe, buses should stay offthe road and students along the route should be
informed of the change of plans. Even when buses are operating, parents are the ones to decide
each day whether or not their child gets on the bus. If bus transportation is not available, a parent
may arrange alternative transportation if they know the school is open.

Frequently I am asked if the above policies will not result in some students being ahead or behind
others and if the gap will widen. This implies that students in the same grade are at the same
level of achievement and move forward in a lock-step fashion. This is far from the case. In any
class, some students are ahead and others behind the average - whatever average means. The
system copes with students who lose a day due to illness, why can&#x27;t it also cope with a student
who loses a day due to bad weather? Granted the number of absentees may be larger on a storm
day, but the problem remains essentially the same.

Closing schools on stormy days is administratively convenient but I believe is disruptive to
students and learning. The decision to attend or not attend on any given day belongs to the
student and&quot;/or pa&quot;rents. I am quite satisfied that teachers are both willing and able to deal with
school absences in a less disruptive fashion. .

Sincerely
