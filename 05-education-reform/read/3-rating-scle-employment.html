<div class="reader-summary">Letter dated July 27, 2018, to Charlottetown Guardian from Don addressing the transition from education to workplace. Drawing on historical Federal government leadership in employment training, Don expresses concern that quality assurance functions have shifted to provinces without adequate capacity. He highlights differences between educational achievement reporting and employment assessment needs (which require evaluation of work quality, timeliness, and problem-solving). He advocates for maintaining Canada&#x27;s post-WWII reputation for excellent employment training.</div>

<p><b>Editor,</b></p>
<p><b>Charlottetown Guardian</b></p>
<p><b>Charlottetown, PEI	</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Dear Sir:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b><b></b></p>
<p><b>Successful transition to the workplace<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>For a century, the Government of Canada has been a major player and, I would say leader, in the promotion and funding of education for employment; today, the Federal government is mostly a funder. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Historically, the federal government, not only provided funds but included a set of conditions for content, standards, staffing and facilities, but more important, the federal government wqs the recognized leader and promoter of a relevant training culture.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>According to my reading of current PEI Labour Market Agreements, the training function, except<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>for funding, has shifted to the Province, ; so too has quality assurance. It is the latter that gives me most cause for worry especially if funding will flow to public schools.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Specific areas of concern include that of:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b>Relevance of content: public education focuses on subjects whereas education for employment focuses on the application of subject matter to solve real life problems.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b>Assessment of training for employment<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>are more stringent than training for post secondary studies and are likely to include such items as quality and quantity of work, as well as timeliness, degree of supervision and creativity in problem solving.</b></p>
<p><b>Employers tell me that the current approach to reporting achievement , by grade levels,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>no longer adequately serves their needs,</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Post WW2 training for employment in Canada was once viewed as a model by many developing countries; it behooves us to retain its positive characteristics in the years ahead.</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Sincerely,</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Don Glendenning</b></p>
<p><b>A long-time student of education</b></p>
