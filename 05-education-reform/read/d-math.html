<div class="reader-summary">Don addresses confusion from using &quot;grade&quot; to denote both age-based cohorts and achievement standards. Teachers report 4-8 year achievement ranges within single grades, creating cascading problems: advanced students become bored, struggling students discouraged, teachers frustrated, parents confused, diploma value declines, public confidence erodes. He notes International Baccalaureate, Red Cross, PISA, P-CAP, and qualification authorities all use &quot;level&quot; terminology for achievement. Renaming would allow students to pursue different subjects at different levels (Grade 11 student simultaneously at Level 7 Math, Level 4 Physics, Level 6 Literature). This proposal directly addresses systemic heterogeneity by replacing age-based lockstep progression with achievement-responsive pathways. Reflects his consistent advocacy for clarity, standards, and flexible personalization within structured frameworks.</div>

<p>Dear Sir:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><b>Achievement levels</b><b></b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Achievement levels confuse me especially when we assign two meanings to the same word. In one instance we use Grade to describe a grouping if young people of roughly the same age; in the other case, we use it to describe a level of achievement such as Grade 9 Math. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>What make it even more confusing is that, because students learn at different rates, teachers report subject matter gaps of 4, 6 or even 8 years in an age group.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As a result:</p>
<p>Students who do well become bored.</p>
<p>Students who fall behind become discouraged</p>
<p>Teachers become frustrated</p>
<p>Parents wonder what is going on</p>
<p>The value of a graduation diploma falls.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The public loses faith in the public school system.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The International Baccalaureate program refers to your achievement as a level; so does the does Canadian Red Cross for swimming.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>PISA and P-CAP results are also reported by level. And I find level to be used by some qualification authorities.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Changing the term would allow a student to study any subject at any level.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As a result for instance, a grade 11 student could be taking Level 7 Math, Level 4 Physics and Level 6 Literature.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Don Glendenning</p>
