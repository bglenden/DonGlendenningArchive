  Structure 
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Comprehensive letter calling for clarity and structural change. Don identifies six issues: (1) purpose is unclear; (2) vision is too narrow (youth-focused); (3) education and schooling are conflated; (4) organizational structure ignores functions; (5) teachers/principals lack operational freedom despite OECD/World Bank recommendations; (6) collaboration literature conflicts with actual silos. He advocates for refocusing from schools to education, from standardized metrics to improvement measures, from credentials to competencies.</div>

<p><b>Dear Editor:</b></p>
<p><b>A call for clarity <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p>My reading of the education literature and discussion with Islanders suggests a need for changes in the way that public education is structured.</p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li1"><b>Purpose- </b>an unclear purpose jeopardizes the ability to plan quality programs and measure their success.</li>
  <li class="li1"><b>Vision</b>. Islanders think that the Department of Education has a responsibility to encourage and support education at all levels; Department of Education documents define Education’s role as serving youth.</li>
  <li class="li1"><b>Education and going to school with-<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span></b>In a 20i9 report, The World Bank, the<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>world’s largest funder of education services, cautioned Ministries of Education about the confusion of treating “education and going to school” as though they are one and the same; a review of PEI education documents suggests that PEI has also fallen into that trap. A school, like a hospital or shopping plaza, is only a resource rich location; education is influenced by student experiences while there.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li1"><b>Structure - <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b> services provided to citizens include information, counselling, instruction, assessment, learning products.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Given this, one would expect senior management positions to reflect these functions in their position titles.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li1"><b>Accountability </b>The OECD tells us that PISA results are better from schools with autonomy in their day-to-day operation; the World Bank advises Ministries of Education to delegate. Mathew Bedard of the Montreal Economic Institute points out that “autonomy and accountability jointly applied” would cost practically nothing and allow education to better adapt to the diversity of student needs and aptitudes. Yet teachers and principals in PEI appear to have little freedom to tailor services to suit individual learner needs.</li>
  <li class="li1"><b>Collaboration</b> the literature suggests the need for and value of collaboration; practice shows the existence of silos.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li1"><b>Grades and grading</b>, represents an attempt to apply standardized measurement to levels of achievement; the writer continues to search for evidence.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
</ul>
<p>Given the above, some restructuring is certainly called for.</p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
<p>Don Glendenning</p>
