<div class="reader-summary">Don calls for democratic public dialogue about fundamental education questions: Why should the state educate citizens? How? Who decides when education is complete? This lengthy piece, structured around an Ontario educator&#x27;s framework, emphasizes that education policy should be citizens&#x27; responsibility, not isolated to government. He critiques Department confusion between &quot;education&quot; and &quot;schooling,&quot; notes community concerns about literacy, numeracy, and practical skills, and proposes structural solutions including a Board of Education to provide ongoing advice. Don argues that current education dysfunction stems from multiple players with conflicting agendas.</div>

<p><b>February 12. 2020</b></p>
<p><b>Dear Editor:</b></p>
<p><b>Conversation needed</b></p>
<p><b>It’s time It’s time for a public conversation about education; to quote a long time education activist from Ontario:</b></p>
<p><b>	</b><b><i>“The public, all the people in an organized, preferably democratic, society/state should/must take ownership of how their young are educated. Everyone and especially parents should be partners in setting the responses to the following issues: <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></i></b></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li1"><b><i>why should the state educate it’s citizens? <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></i></b></li>
  <li class="li1"><b><i>How should the state educate it’s citizens? <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></i></b></li>
  <li class="li1"><b><i>Who should decide when a citizen is educated?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></i></b></li>
  <li class="li1"><b><i>What part of the state’s limited resources should be put towards educating every citizen?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Who decides how much?</i></b></li>
  <li class="li1"><b><i>Should schools be operated? As<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>a for profit business?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Like a community library? Like a not for profit hospital with a chief medical officer and a chief admin officer?</i></b></li>
</ul>
<p><b>The education literature is full of comment about schools. The World Bank cautions us about thinking that going to school and getting an education ae the same. The OECD ells us that PISA results are better when schools have autonomy in their day o day operation. The Montreal Economic Institute argues for accountability. Given the importance of family and community, Islanders deserve to be both consulted and informed about education as well as schools. Although I support the appointment of school trustees, I must point out that most questions and criticisms I encounter are about education not schooling – levels of literacy and numeracy, self development, knowledge of local community, personal finance, and the usual “ability to make chanfe”. It appears that day-to-day citizen skills” are not required to obtain a diploma.</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Lt me suggest two changes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>First(1) a public conversation inform and listen to citizen views as to future education in PEI and (2) a Board of Education to provide on-going advice.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b>Sincerely</b></p>

<p><b>but little about other education<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>services and schools<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>are unlikely<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>to improve until we understand their role within education.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Islanders deserve to be better informed but also to be consulted about education – what it is, who it’s for, principles on which it will operate, what government will pay for, etc.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My own conversations with IlandersBecause of the fear factor, any conversation likely needs o be sanctioned, and probably led, by the Minister. In the spirit of political cooperation, perhaps an all- party panel could be struck to lead such a discussion.</b></p>
<p><b>for many of the <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>and decides to build school added “Lifelong learning”. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b>I assume it was a political move because anything I read suggests “education” already includes both. Furthermore, documents emanating from the Department continue to support the view that education and<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>instruction (the work of schools) are the same.</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>One further point; education likes consultants.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If the Province decides to act, based on past history, they would likely hire an outside consultant. I recommend instead, that the person or persons<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>who are going to implement the change be asked to come up with a plan; hire consultants to help if needed, but make the project a responsibility of the peope who will implement the decision.</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>To add to the confusion, the Department sees its role as one of “delivering high quality programs” to youth, which was essentially the same role as the previous government. Again, a narrow role and one, I suggests, that leaves communities with gaps in continuing education, shifts costs of gaining ssential skills from secondary choolss to pot secondary institutions, and leaves Islanders unprepared for job vacancies that exist<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>in our home Province. Before sitting to write, I<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>scanned documents from other Provinces as to see how their role in education are expressed; the clearest, “”leadership and direction’, was mentioned by Saskatchewan that’s a role we should emulate.</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Life is complex; people fill many roles; there is much to be learned - to communicate, to get along with others, to look after ourselves and .to look after the environment.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It’s more than parents can handle; parents need help; the rest of us need help too. It’s in the interests of the community to provide help. But providing help is complex. There are so many people, such a range of differences, disparate needs, etc. etc.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Government wants to help, so they set up a system of schools; decide what everyone needs and that all young people must attend<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>– but service got lost, education become a product described by hours, lessons, outcomes, grades, requirements, diplomas, degrees, years of schooling, etc.; responding to citizen needs is no longer part of the equation; educators seem to have withdrawn from public conversation and, stay inside their respective silos.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Service” and education got lost in the process.</b></p>
<p><b>Currently there are so many players with different and conflicting agendas involved with public education it is no wonder “schools” are either dysfunctional or operational at a high social, psychological, emotional, organizational stress level that make them, in many instances, toxic 	work/learning environments.</b></p>
<p><b>then about schools; schools won’t get any better until we understand their role within an education system.</b></p>
