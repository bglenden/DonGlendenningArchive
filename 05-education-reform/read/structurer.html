<div class="reader-summary">Extended letter based on PEI school trustee&#x27;s comments years ago about need for structural reform. Addresses vision (public statement of goals/ideals/values—PEI philosophy statement lacks detail), conceptual clarity (distinguishing education from schooling), structure (services vs. clients served), accountability, and collaboration. Concludes these issues, while not unique or new, collectively hobble education&#x27;s ability to serve and should be modified or discarded.</div>

<b>Dear Editor</b></p>
<p align="center" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 108%"><b>Restructuring
called for</b></p>
<p align="right" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 108%"><b>D-10-B

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 108%"><b>Many
years ago, a PEI school trustee spoke of the need for structural
reform in our education system. Recent snowy weekends have given me a
chance to investigate; he was right.  Here are my notes.</b></p>
<ol>
	<li><p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0in"><b>Vision
	-  a public statement of an organization’s goals , purposes.
	ideals, core values and long- term objectives; a vision statement
	usually also lays out beliefs and guiding principles. Although PEI
	has a philosophy statement, it iis short on detalls neded to build
	educational programs.</b></p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0in"><b>Conceptual
	clarity – education documents tend to leave out important detail
	of what is intended or planned.  For example, although PEI documents
	are about education, they actually treat  “education and going to
	school” as though they are one and the same.  A school, like a
	hospital or shopping plaza, at best is only a resource rich
	location; education is influenced by student   experiences while
	there.</b></p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0in"><b>Structure
	-  ”Form follows function” is still the standard when
	structuring any venture and one would expect the management
	structure to reflect functions or services offered. In addition,
	front line workers in a service organization need both  the skills
	and flexibility to respond to learner needs.</b></p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0in"><b>Accountability
	-  The OECD tells us that PISA results are better from schools with
	autonomy in their day-to-day operation; the World Bank advises
	Ministries of Education to delegate. Mathew Bedard of the Montreal
	Economic Institute points out that “autonomy and accountability
	jointly applied” would cost practically nothing and allow
	education to better adapt to the diversity of student needs and
	aptitudes. Yet the education sytem in PEI appear to have little
	freedom to tailor services to meet individual learner needs.</b></p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0in"><b>Collaboration
	refers to educators working with the community to increase student
	learning:  Evidence suggests that the more people that are invested
	in a student’s education process, the greater the chances of
	student success.  Perhaps unfairly, teachers are not viewed by the
	community as collaborators or communicators in the education
	process.</b></p></li>
</ol>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 108%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 108%"><b>I
am not suggesting that these issues are unique to education in PEI,
are new, that they were deliberate nor implemented knowingly. Quite
the contrary, each was introduced to solve some problem. 
Collectively, however, they hobble   education’s ability to serve
and should be modified or discarded. </b>
