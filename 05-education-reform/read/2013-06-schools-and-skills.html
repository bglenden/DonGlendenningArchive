  2013-06 Schools and skills
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">In response to student Danielle Phelan&#x27;s concerns about education and employment, Don argues that each educational level should equip students either for the next level or for entry-level employment. He cites Conference Board of Canada research showing that employability skills are everyday competencies (literacy, numeracy, personal management, teamwork) rather than technical expertise requiring expensive facilities. He contends schools must shift from academic focus to life-relevant skills while maintaining rigor.</div>

<p>Dear Sir:</p>
<p><b>Schools and skills</b></p>
<p>Danielle Phelan raised an important issue (‘Education and finding work’, The Guardian, March 23, 2013), the role of education in helping one prepare for work.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Danielle is neither the first nor only student to pose the question.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Finding work is very much on the mind of young people I talk with; schools have both an opportunity and a responsibility to help. In fact, I am of the view that each level of schooling has a responsibility to teach the skills needed to either enter the next level of schooling or the skills required for entry level employment. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Education for employment usually conjures up images of large, well equipped and expensive shops and laboratories.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Not so, according to the Conference Board of Canada; employability skills are mostly the things we do every day and involve “literacy and numeracy, personal management skills and teamwork”; my conversations with the business community confirm this view. Employability skills could as easily be labelled citizenship skills, life skills or general education.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Schools focus on academic subjects delivered through a series of courses on a variety of subjects.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Preparing for life outside school requires a different approach, a change in the ways schools operate, an approach that is more demanding, more engaging, and more reflective of life outside school – and a change that is long overdue.</p>
<p>Canada needs skilled people, young people are seeking employment; teaching employability skills is a legitimate role for schools; it would be a win-win situation for all.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If schools do not teach them, who should?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Danielle deserves a response, and of course, I’d like to hear from you at<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>HYPERLINK "mailto:standards2020@gmail.com" <span>standards2020@gmail.com</span> . <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
