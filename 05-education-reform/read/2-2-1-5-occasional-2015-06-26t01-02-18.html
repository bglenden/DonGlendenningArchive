<div class="reader-summary">Duplicate/version of the Canadian Qualification Authority paper (D-8), proposing an independent qualification authority (AQUA) to assess and certify performance competencies. Don emphasizes separating certification from teaching, supporting lifelong learning, and reducing teacher burden in sorting students, reflecting his fundamental conviction that credentials and qualifications serve different purposes.</div>

	<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">Education is a lifelong process of
	gaining experiences that have a formative effect on the way we feel,
	think and act; it is a process of changing attitudes, skills and
	knowledge.  Education is a key factor in determining one’s quality
	of life; in the same way, the collective education of our citizens
	will determine to a significant degree the future quality of our
	community and country. Because of the importance of education, our
	country and community have invested heavily in a variety of
	educational support services including schools colleges and
	universities and that workforce must be mobile to ensure a
	well-functioning economy.   While the contribution of postsecondary
	education to economic development for some time,it would appear that

	level, os increasingly coming into view,<span lang="en-US">to create

	found in an occupation or field. A qualification authority would
	reduce if not eliminate the confusion faced by teachers between
	teaching and sorting, focus certification more clearly on
	performance that matters, support lifelong learning and
	self-directed study, clearly focus school evaluation on helping
	learners learn, and reduce major for distractions for teachers
	caused by operating the sorting process.  It would, in effect, have
	two clients, the organizations desiring an assessment service and
	individuals wanting to confirm thelevel and suitability of their
	qualifications.  A qualification authority would take its cues from
	the destination of the learner, focus on what a client can do and
	how well, examine each skills carried and assess their suitability 
	also identify gaps for the individual would not simply administer . 
	A qualification authority could also play a useful role in helping
	people identify gaps in their preparation for a given field of work.
