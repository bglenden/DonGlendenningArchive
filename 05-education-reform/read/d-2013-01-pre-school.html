<div class="reader-summary">Don advocates for reframing early childhood education as development-focused rather than school-preparation-focused. He cites research suggesting that preschool focus may actually interfere with development of critical social skills. Don argues early childhood education deserves the same organizational independence as postsecondary education, not as a downward extension of schooling. He proposes three organizational options: an Early Childhood Commission, integration with Health or Social Services (already serving this age), or delegating school operation to boards to allow the Department to focus on all educational needs. Don emphasizes early years as a distinct life stage requiring customized approaches and autonomy from traditional school regulations and structures.</div>

<p>Dear Sir:</p>
<p><b>Strike Preschool from our Vocabulary</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>We need to take a fresh look at early childhood development, discard labels and focus on the kind of support needed or known to be helpful to children during their early years.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is a key period in one’s life and what we experience, or don’t experience, is a determining factor in what we become in adult life.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The first few years are a period of development, including but not limited to education; the focus should be on preparing for life not just on pteparing for school.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In fact an article in the New York Times on February 26, 2013 suggests that a preschool focus may even interfere with the development of important social skills<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Early childhood education is as important as post secondary and adult education.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It deserves its own focus; it is not just a downward extension of schoolingIt deserves its own freedom, its own leadership its own organization, diffwrent rules and regulations, a different learning atmosphere.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Organizationally,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>a number of options come to mind (1) create an early Childhood Commission to oversee the program, (2) add the function to the Department of Health or social Services who are already direct delivering support directly to youngsters of this age, or (3) delegate responsibility for school operation to school boards<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>thereby allowing the Department to focus on all educational needs of Islanders rather thanjust schools.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Let your creative juices flow and send your ideas to me at<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>HYPERLINK "mailto:standards2020@gmail.com" <span>standards2020@gmail.com</span><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
