  20-Editor communication
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Brief commentary on communication problems in PEI education during pandemic-challenged times. Don identifies three communication issues: conflating &quot;schooling&quot; and &quot;education&quot; as identical; lack of shared vision about education roles; confusion between credentials and qualifications. He notes seniors ask where one &quot;got their education&quot; when seeking schooling information, and employers misunderstand the distinction between credentials and qualifications. Don argues these terminological confusions raise questions about the Department&#x27;s leadership and vision clarity. This document shows his concern with precise language and conceptual clarity in education discourse.</div>
