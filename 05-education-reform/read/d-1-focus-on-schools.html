  D 1-Focus on schools
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Dated March 21, 2014, Don analyzes emerging shifts in public discourse about education. He identifies two complementary changes: growing structural concerns about schools (standards, relevance, age-based grouping) and recognition that education extends beyond schooling. He notes that while educators cannot unilaterally drive change, the community is increasingly aware that education involves homes, workplaces, and community settings. The letter demonstrates his systems thinking and understanding that lasting educational improvement requires comprehensive societal engagement rather than school-centric reforms.</div>

<p>Editor,</p>

<p>Dear Sir:</p>
<p><b>A shift in thinking</b></p>
<p>In the past few months, I’ve been party to many conversations about education, during which I’ve learned much and met many interesting people.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Included in those conversations was a series of workshops across PEI based on findings of a recent survey of Island youth by the Community Foundation (www.cfpei.ca).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>People are very concerned about education, especially the education of youth, and that concern is wider and deeper than ever before.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Islanders have the uncomfortable feeling that things are not getting any better; they may be wrong but the feeling is widespread.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li1">Concerns about schools are mostly structural, standards, relevance, the declining value of diplomas, and the inability to respond to individual needs, and age based grouping to name a few.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>These concerns are complex, immediate, practical</li>
  <li class="li1">Concerns about education are more complex – or is it more complicated.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The world is changing; schools cannot and should not be expected to do all the new things.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The things schools do are still needed but there are alternative ways of providing them; increasing recognition that “schoolification” of education is not enough.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Education is a community issue, cannot be solved by schools alone, Education happening outside the school needs to be counted, supported of education. Recognition of the importance of the home, importance of work habits and personal skills, the measurement of education by years spent in formal studies. Changing nature of employmen, gaps between<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>what is needed and what is taught, prevalence of drugs.</li>
</ul>
<p>There is a switch in public thinking; in fact, two – more than schooling</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Educators are not likely , perhaps not able, to bring about the desired chnages</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Don Glendenning</p>
<p>A long-time student of education</p>
