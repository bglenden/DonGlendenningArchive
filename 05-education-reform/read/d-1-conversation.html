  D-1  Conversation 
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">This file contains two related pieces. First, Don proposes increased public conversation about education, noting that PEI&#x27;s education definition has narrowed over 50 years. He offers his own definition: &quot;any experience that changes what a person knows, feels, believes, values or is able to do.&quot; Second, he observes that the World Bank&#x27;s concern about developing countries confusing schooling with education also applies to developed nations like Canada. Education is a process; school is a place. He proposes that PEI develop a &quot;full scale education system&quot; similar to a health system—comprehensive, serving all Islanders, with schools as one component. He lists key elements: learners, teachers, learning devices, research access, standards, delivery agency, assessment, tutoring, information and counselling. Such a system would organize around branches of education (essential skills, science, employment skills, technology) while schools organize by age.</div>

<p><b>Dear Editor:</b></p>
<p><b>Conversation needed</b></p>
<p><b>We should talk more, and more often, about education.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b>Let me start the conversation by focusing on terminology – seems to me that the definition of education has narrowed over the past 50 years. I skimmed a number of sources (Department, school websites, CAMET, CMEC, CEA, etc.) to view their definitions. Didn’t find any definitions but IT is not my strength.</b></p>
<p><b>My definition of education is a simple one; I consider education to be any experience that change what a person knows, feels, believes, values or is able to do; a good education is one that enables a person to handle decisions about everyday life.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b>Literature from the Department of Education seems to limit education to a service for the young, but maybe the Department is limited to serving the young. I’m not sure.</b></p>
<p><b>In the meantime, I’ll continue to search.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b>Sincerely</b></p>

<p><b>Dear Editor:</b></p>
<p><b>On Further Examination</b></p>
<p><b>I mentioned before that the World Bank was concerned about developing countries that confuse going to school and getting an education. Interesting indeed but not limited to developing<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>countries.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b>Education is a process; school is a place.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That is not to say that you do not learn, but rather, your education is not limited to what you learn in school. Furthermore, the literature often carries articles about how to increase the educational value of schools.</b></p>
<p><b>Some schools<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b>An Education System Might Work better.</b></p>
<p><b>Education seems to be in turmoil everywhere. According to what I read, attendance has dropped, the number of independent learners is on the increase, young people are interested in learning employment skills, tutoring is on the increase, and colleges costs have skyrocketed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>School systems may not be sufficient for the task. It my be time for PEI to develop a full scale education system.</b></p>
<p><b>An education system may be likened to a health system; it caters to any and all Islanders who need or want help. It would include schools but not be limited to schools. One could liken it to a health system that includes hospitals and clinics but services would not be limited to people in schools.</b></p>
<p><b>Elements of an education system usually include:</b></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li1"><b>Learners</b></li>
  <li class="li1"><b>Teachers</b></li>
  <li class="li1"><b>Learning devices</b></li>
  <li class="li1"><b>Access to research</b></li>
  <li class="li1"><b>Standards</b></li>
  <li class="li1"><b>A Delivery agency</b></li>
  <li class="li1"><b>Assessment</b></li>
  <li class="li1"><b>Tutoring</b></li>
  <li class="li1"><b>Information and counselling</b></li>
</ul>
<p><b>An education systems organize around branches of education - essential skills, science, employment skills, technology, etc.; schools would still organize around ages. Community organizations, I expect, would emerge around branches of education as well as arounf schools. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
