<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Dear .  
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">It is a while since
we last spoke about public education and, although the Credit Union
made a contribution to our cause some time ago and you are on our
mailing list, I’d like to take a moment to bring you up to date on
our activities.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">As for the state of
education generally on PEI, I think it fair to say that conversation
about education is more frequent, more widespread, and in a more
urgent tone than when we had our last conversation on the subject. 
Since then, PEI has a new Minister and Deputy Minister of Education
and, we are told to expect some announcements shortly about changes
being planned.  Obviously, we will be interested to see if the
changes include any of the items proposed in our discussions and
presentations or included in our Call for Action. (Attached)</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">While hope springs
eternal for real change in education, history tells us that whatever
is proposed is likely to fall far short of what is required and, even
more so, is likely not to deal with root causes.  From that vantage
point, we are stepping up our activities and taking bolder steps to
bring about change including:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Continuing and
	improving our monthly bilingual newsletter, expanding activities in
	the social media, continuing our education award but this time with
	a focus on the application of technology, 
	</p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Bringing
	together a group of education officials, employers, institutional
	representatives , employers and the public at large to discuss what
	can be done to ensure that our young people have the skills needed
	to enter postsecondary institutions or employment.  You will
	recognize that the convening of such a group by an independent body
	is a significant  intrusion into domains that heretofore have been
	out of bounds except to the Miniater and his officials</p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">In response to
	significant weaknesses in the setting of standards, the absence of
	relevant evaluative criteria and the conflict of role when those who
	teach also grade, Education 20/20 proposes to study the operation of
	an independent qualification authority, especially to assess basic
	skill levels.</p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Convening
	roundtables to explore the underlying beliefs and best practices of
	a quality education system.</p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><a name="_GoBack"></a>
	 It is likely that our future will include study centres; the exact
	nature of which will become clear in the year ahead.</p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">And, we will
	continue our efforts to “update’  Islanders as to what
	constitutes an appropriate education and delivery system for the
	21<sup>st</sup> century.</p></li>
</ul>

that the above activities take considerable time and some money,
therefore this letter also comes with a request for financial support

able to We cannot do this alone; we need your help, and the help of
many Islanders, I would appreciate the opportunity, therefore, to
talk with you, not so much about the problem as about some solutions.
 I’ll be in touch within the next few days about a meeting time and
place.
