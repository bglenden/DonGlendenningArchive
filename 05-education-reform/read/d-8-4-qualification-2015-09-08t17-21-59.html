  D-8-4 Qualification @2015-09-08T17;21;59
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">A detailed proposal for establishing a Canadian qualification framework emphasizing the distinction between credentials and qualifications. Glendenning argues that qualification authorities should assess individuals directly based on demonstrated performance rather than relying on institution-based input measures, and should not organize competitions or assign grades—functions that should remain with schools.</div>

	Labour
	mobility is a fact of life; our ancestors practiced it, so have most
	of us.  The difference is that, jobs have become more complex,
	numbers have increased, the pace has quickened and people travel
	further afield.  Labour
	mobility
	is an important contributor to our economy and refers to the
	movement of people from job to job, occupation to occupation and
	from one geographical location to another. Labour mobility may be
	hampered by geographic ties, absence of housing, unemployment
	benefits, licensing requirements, lack of portable qualifications,
	and lack of recognized educational levels; the latter, educational
	levels, is the subject of this paper.</p>
	<h2 style="margin-top: 0in"><span style="font-weight: normal">To
	facilitate the movement of workers, both within and between
	countries, many countries have developed a qualification framework
	and a qualification authority to enforce it; Canada and the US are
	exceptions. </span><span style="font-weight: normal">Qualification
	authorities operate under government legislation but often have
	their own governing structure.  While the nature of their work
	varies from country to county, qualification authorities usually
	perform direct assessments of individuals, </span><span lang="en-US"><span style="font-weight: normal">set,

	occupation or field, set standards and benchmarks; translate
	qualification documents; </span></span><span lang="en-NZ"><span style="font-weight: normal">liaise

	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Not
	surprising, people often confuse credentials and qualifications. 
	Diplomas and degrees are credentials and are awarded by institutions
	to people who have successfully completed a program or course of
	studies.  
	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Credentialling
	criteria are mostly knowledge based and are heavy on input <span lang="en-US">measures,
	time, content studied, qualification of teachers; they also
	emphasize what has been studied rather than what has been learned. 
	</span>T<span lang="en-US">he
	reliability of credentials is limited, however, due to the large
	number of issuing organizations , reliance on teacher judgement and
	conflicting school policies such as social promotion.  </span>A
	qualification, on the other hand, is an actual measure of what the
	holder can do with what he or she knows.  As an example, apprentices
	may take their formal training  in high schools, colleges,
	industrial training programs or even the armed forces.  Training is
	based on a common occupational analysis, agreed stages, on-job
	training and common exams, common analyses, both provincial and
	national examinations and an endorsement known as the Red Seal. 
	Other Canadian examples of the separation of credentialing and
	qualification include the work of the Royal Canadian Conservatory of
	Music, Canadian Red Cross, Canadian Swimming.<span lang="en-US">

	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Education
	20/20 Inc. supports  the establishment of a Canadian qualification
	framework and an independent body to run it.  Such an authority
	would assess and certify a person’s level of performance on a task
	or set of tasks such as found in an occupation or field of study.
	For example, a qualifications authority would assume the grading
	function now handled by teachers but not the formative or
	dfiagnostic function. The qualifications authority would focus
	certification clearly on performance that matters support lifelong
	learning, and self-directed study and thereby allow schools to focus
	on formative assessment practices that serve to help students learn.
	A qualification authority would, in effect, serve two clients,
	organizations (i.e., employers) desiring an assessment of
	prospective employees and individuals wanting to establish the level
	and suitability of their qualifications. While qualification
	authorities we are familiar with, focus on approving courses,
	accrediting institutions, and analyzing current offerings; we
	believe in a qualification authority that assesses individuals
	directly, not one that massages the minutiae of hours, outcomes,
	teacher qualification of education providers. A qualification
	authority could also play a useful role in helping people identify
	gaps in their preparation for a given field of work.

	certification requirements. A qualification authority would not,
	however, organize competitions, rank students, or grant credentials.
