education outside public institutions; I refer to a dozen agencies on
PEI part of whose educational programs have been accepted by the
Department of Education for external credits, some private schools,
home schooling parents, employer based training and a number of
organizations receiving funding to mount programs for underserved
youth.  Education 20/20 Inc. plans to address that need through a
series of webinar-style 3-5 minute video clips for use by educators
either alone or in groups.  Our first series, “A Learning
Framework” is under development and consists of four sessions (1)
<b>Learners which
</b>provides background
as to why learners differ, (2) <b>Learning:</b>
sheds light on what happens when a person learns, (3) <b>Levels

</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">It
takes an informed and engaged community to educate a child; evidence
shows that students perform better in schools where parents and the
community work together; in PEI, during the last few months, the
Department of Education has dramatically expanded the number of
external credits.  Education 20/20   would like to see cooperation
between schools and other community organizations expanded even
further.

<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><br />

</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">It
is important help policy makers become aware and up- to- date on
issues about which they make policies.  In saying this, we are aware
of, and have reviewed Policy CPS-022 (Effective date: September 2,
2003), and understand the limits placed on charitable organizations
especially as they relate to lobbying and political activities</p>

of at least some elements of their program, and increasing
engagement.  (Copy of presentation included with enclosed documents)</p>

<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><u><b>Work
with employers:</b></u></p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">About
a year ago, the Community Foundation of Prince Edward Island
conducted a survey of over 200 young people to better understand
their issues.  (<u><a href="http://www.cfpei.ca/">www.cfpei.ca</a></u>).
On reviewing their report, Education 20/20 was struck by the
“preparedness gap”, that is the preparedness of young people for
further education and for work.   Early in 2014, Education 20/20 Inc.
organized workshops in six communities across the Island to publicize
the findings, determine the extent of the concern, and identify
actions, if any, that could or should be taken. Perhaps the most
significant finding was the lack of communication about educational
matters between providers and users of educational services.  Survey
results have informed the following activities: 
</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><br />

</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">To
date, Education 20/20 Inc. has not been able to find well defined and
broadly accepted achievement levels on school subjects.  Furthermore,
it appears that grade levels are proving inadequate as a measure of
student achievement; teachers tell us that in any school grade and
subject, levels of student achievement will vary significantly, 3-4
gade levels not uncommon but five to six not rare in any classroom. 
We have  a committee exploring options as to steps that may help.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><br />

</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Working
with employers and educators seeking alternative ways for employers
to obtain the information they want about an applicant’s &quot;essential
skills&quot;.  A mechanism for PEI is now emerging that will see the
<u>Holland College
Assessment Centre</u>
and <u>Workplace
Learning PEI</u>
offering a testing service for employers and employees.    The
initiative is continuing.  .  Based on discussions to date with
employers, UPEI and Holland College, the likely outcome will be a
system, similar to that practiced in music, whereby the establishment
of levels is handled by the Royal Canadian Conservatory of Music
rather than local teachers of music; exploration continues.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><br />

</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">One
of the conclusions resulting from our preparedness workshops is the
need for direct dialogue between education and the community it
serves.  To bridge the gap, we are organizing a series of
discussions; each session will have a one page background paper, a
presentation if appropriate, and followed by open discussion.  The
objective is to increase communications rather than to reach
agreement.  The pilot run of discussions will begin in early 2015
between 4:30 and 6:00 pm with a group not to exceed 20 people;
additional groups will be organized if numbers warrant.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><br />

</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">We
will continue to engage employers and educators in projects and
panels to increase communication; service clubs will be encouraged to
invite educators, especially principals, as speakers, and will make a
special attempt to produce occasional papers and media releases about
items of interest to them.

<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><u><b>Working
with community-based education organizations</b></u></p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><br />

</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">We
are all familiar with schools, colleges and universities as providers
of educational services; we are less familiar with, and often
overlook, the many other providers of educational services including
youth organizations, cadet programs, sports development programs,
etc.   More to the point, staff in these groups are seldom included
in conferences, workshops or other educational activities.  Education
20/20  Inc. views them as an important and growing segment of our
education system and  plans to (a) survey them as to their needs and
interests and  (b) actively recruit their participation in ongoing
activities.

<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><br />

</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Parents
play a pivotal role in the education of their children; children
perform better when their parents and the community are engaged in
the education process and yet, broadly speaking, the school system
does not encourage deep engagement.  To encourage engagement,
Education 20/20 Inc. has instituted an award of Excellence to a
school or learning centre that best demonstrates a high level of
engagement in its day to day activities, especially those activities
over which the school has control.  (Announcements, descriptions and

<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Surveys

issues with results publicly reported.</p>

</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><br />

</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">There
are a number of significant gaps in our instructional services:</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><br />

</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><u><b>Continuing
Education 		gaps</b></u></p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><br />

</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Education
is a lifelong process; most of our educational funding, however, goes
to institutions and for the education of the young.  But in rapidly
changing times and internationalization of  the world, continuing
education becomes even more important.  In addition, it appears that
most part time courses now available are limited to courses being
offered to others on a full time basis.  Although technology has put
knowledge building within easy reach of many adults, maintaining and
progressing in the workplace may also require new skills and
attitudes that can best be dealt with in group settings. In any case,
our first step will be to undertake a survey to better define the
gap.  With that in hand, we can develop a plan of action.  
</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><br />

</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><u><b>Essential
Skills</b></u></p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><br />

</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">In
terms of basic or essential skills, we have identified at least two
groups of young people who need help. One group consists of people
with high school graduation diplomas but insufficient skills to enter
further studies or work.  Education 20/20 plans to offer a tutoring
program fashioned on the Sunshine tutoring program offered in
Dartmouth Nova Scotia.  Under this arrangement, sessions will be of
two hours duration once a week in the late afternoon.  Tutors will be
volunteers; space has been offered by the PEI Association of
Professional Engineers; costs will be minimal and will be met through
donations from individuals and businesses.  If demand warrants, we
will grow this service into a full service study centre where youth
can get customized help to meet their particular needs.  That help
may be as simple as counselling and advice but also may include
diagnosis, access to resources, tutoring, counselling or referral to
another source of help.   Our longer term plan is to expand the
service as needed and as resources allow including career information
counselling and advice but also may include diagnosis, access to
resources, tutoring, counselling or referral to another source of
help.   The services may be expanded to other communities</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in; margin-left: 0.5in"><br />

</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">A
second group may have the skills that employers need/want but do not
have the documentation to prove.  Education 20/20 Inc. is actively
engaged with the business and education communities (Holland College,
the University of Prince Edward Island, and community educational
organizations) seeking a resolution to the problem. The resources and
good will are available in the community; information and scheduling
should solve the problem.</p>

20/20 Inc. realizes the importance research and innovation and will
encourage research and researchers through publicize research
findings, identify and promote underserved areas, organizing
brainstorming sessions, publicizing research findings, and featuring
researchers in our public sessions. 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Existing
research, it seems to us, focuses almost exclusively on institution
based education, education  of preschoolers and the young  and
literacy. When one considers the broader field one thinks of  the
shortage of research on credentials and qualifications, determining
levels of achievement, delivery models, alternative approaches to
grouping, continuing education</p>

<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><br />

</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">We
plan a series of occasional papers, short papers on issues related to
any aspect of education.  Papers may report research findings, best
practices, innovations, and points of view.  Papers will be aimed at
the general public and be widely available electronically. 
Occasional papers provide information and views on a variety of
subjects but also provide an opportunity, and even encouragement, to
people to clarify their views and “grow’ in their chosen field.
The first is a brief report on a series of workshops held throughout
the Province earlier this year. Another, on Charter Schools, arises
from a request following a public meeting, a third responds at least
in part, to providing a framework making decisions about education.
