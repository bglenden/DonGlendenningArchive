<div class="reader-summary">Substantial draft on &quot;CONVERSATION NEEDED&quot; about education. Don surveys Islanders&#x27; concerns about education versus schools, notes World Bank warning about confusing the two, and discusses removal of &quot;education&quot; from PEI&#x27;s Education Act. Provides definitions of education, school, college, and university. Proposes &quot;life roles&quot; framework (individual, family member, citizen, student, producer, consumer) and discusses education&#x27;s role in each. Extensive notes on education system structure, focusing on education delivery versus school operations—reflects his major policy interests.</div>

<p>About Education</p>
<p><b>CONVERSATION NEEDED</b></p>
<p><b>We need a conversation about education. I say this based on my reading. My own experience and conversations with Islanders.</b></p>
<p><b>Islanders believe education to be important both for individuals and the community at large; but they have problems linking school offerings with the life they experience or the community they inhabit. I’m often asked questions about current practices but seldom<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>find information to respond. Better documentation is called for.</b></p>
<p><b>Public health has<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>a variety of public support groups – heart and stroke, diabetes, multiple schlerosis, hearing and vision as examples. Seems to me that education should do the same. While home and school Associations serve us well at the community level. Support for public conversations about education (mathematics, arts, personal management and employment skills to name but a few) are rare.</b></p>
<p><b>Public education lacks clarity; it needs to refocus. A few years ago, The World Bank cautioned developing countries about confusing education and schooling; we still do. In fact, I learned recently that a definition of “education” was left out of the most recent education Act<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>and, in fact replaced by “schooling”. Now I know that schooling is an important part of education but the two are not the same. As a result of the change, the Department is organized to run schools rather that promote education. around schools rather than Education.</b></p>
<p><b>As I understand it, education</b></p>

<p>About Education</p>
<p>	B</p>
<p>Some Definitions</p>
<p>I am not sure just how our Department of Education defines education, but here is my usual response</p>
<p><b>Education</b>: a process of engaging in experiences that result in learning information, skills, attitudes<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>and other attributes.</p>
<p><b>Education:</b> a sector of the economy focused on providing services to people who want to learn</p>
<p><b>Educated:</b> a level of education perceived to equip people to solve most problems of everyday life.</p>
<p><b>School:</b> A facility designed, equipped and staffed to support the education process.</p>
<p><b>College: an educational institution providing higher education, specialized or vocational training</b></p>
<p><b>University: an educational institution designed for instruction and examination of students in various fields of learning</b></p>

<p>About Education</p>
<p>	C</p>
<p><b>Purpose</b></p>
<p><b>Each person has their own reason for pursuing, improving, growing their education. For most people, improving education increases their likelihood of surviving and thriving in future years.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Communities also support education in the expectation that it will improve the community as a place to live. But governments and communities may also have expectations and purposes for supporting education.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b>In my reflection, I adopted the “life roles” model used by the Oregon Department of Education. According to Oregon, we each fill six life roles: individual, family member, citizen, student, producer and consumer. Presumably education contributes to all but I have not found any evidence on the matter</b></p>
<p><b>Purposes for public education vary across the country. New Brunswick seems to includes “citizen neesa” as a benchmark. I am less sure about other provinces<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>including ours. I happen to believe in curriculum maps but I’ll leave that<span class="Apple-converted-space">        </span>for a separate letter.</b></p>
<p><b>Sincerely</b></p>

<p><b>I write this in order to encourage the Department to review and clarify its purpose because the Department’s definition is not clear and, furthermore, a clear purpose is required to have a strong system.</b></p>

<p><b>Focus</b></p>
<p><b>One of its annual reports, the World Bank cautioned developing countries about thinking that going to school and getting an education are one and the same; we seem to have fallen into that trap also. Put simply, ducation is a process; school is a place where the process is practiced. Using he two interchangeably is confusing.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b>As an example, the PEI Government organize its activities around branches. Yje Department of Agricultire, for example, is organized around land, crops. animals and		Health is organized around primary carmhospitals and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b>To be consistent, the Deprtment would likely organize around Mathematics, the arts, languages and science.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Instead, education<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>is organized around levels –primary, elementary, secondary and tertiary.</b></p>
