<p><b>Our Money’s Worth</b></p>
<p>Each year we spend about $10,000 for each child in the public school system; that’s over $100,000 by graduation.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>For that, schools provide great child care services but a somewhat uncertain level of education.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We can all point to students who used the school system and went on to great accomplishments, but too often I am hear stories of students not served well.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And there is a rising level of frustration in the land about the gap between what we expect of schools and what schools provide.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I see it as an organization problem rather than an education<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>But first we have to understand that the school system does not operate on the usual rules. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Normally a person or organization provides a service and users decide whether or not to use it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In most cases, the user of the server has choices first whether or not to participate at all and, if so, on the choice of provider:; , and the providers income reflects in some way the nature and level of service provided.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Not so in education so there is a reduced need to communicate and few consequences if they don’t.</p>
<p>The matter is further complicated by the fact that government decides the school you go to, the courses available, the teacher you’ll have, the qualifications of teachers, the texts you’ll use, how long you’ll stay, the documents you’ll reveive and the kind of information you receive about your progress.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And government is not inclined to listen to your ideas, ignores your complaints and makes you feel uncomfortable for asking questions, etc., etc.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And it appears that, for whatever reason,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>the gap between user and provider has widened and, Over the years, it<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>That model differes dramatically from the model followed in health, justice, and most other helping professions.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></p>
<p>Unfortunately, users of our education system have low expectations as to what it can and should do and they seem to feel that they can do little about it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Teachers cannot alter the schedule to help students, principals have little flexibility to select a complement of staff that best suits their community, learners cannot choose courses that will best serve them, the focus is on post secondary studies not on education</p>
<p>First of all, the system will not change itsely.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>tIt is often said that i Takes fortyh years to bring aboput a significant change in education – and it seems to me that forty yyears may be optimistic.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Many of the changes being recommended were known forty years ago We don’t neeed a new survey or sudy, anew csection in the Miniastry or at school board level.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We just need to get on and do some of he things we Outside interventions are neededBased on my readI believe that changes I’ve concluded that the desired changes will<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Lets start with a few simple things:</p>
<p>Set a reading standardRequire a level of reading in order to receive a graduation diploma</p>
<p>Put reading on report cards</p>
<p>Design a report card that provides useful information</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The delivery of educational services requires a major overhaul.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But people I talk to know that.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But where to start? <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Arise from teachers and from the public</p>
<p>Teachers need to agitate for changes in the way schools operate</p>

<p>Parents through their MLA</p>

<p>usersCommunication is a two way street and, at least in my view, neither side does it well.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Let me use reading as an example.</p>
