  Learning to learners
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">In this October 2024 letter, Don reconceptualizes education as a service supporting the learning process through information, encouragement, funding, instruction, assessment, assignments, materials, and technology. He notes learners study at their own pace, anywhere and anytime—schools, home, work, transit, day or night. Independent learners are increasing. Traditional education has brought &quot;learners to learning&quot; through schools; Don advocates developing the reverse approach: bringing &quot;learning to learners&quot; wherever they are. This service-oriented perspective represents a fundamental reframing of education from institutional (school-based) to learner-centered (learning-based), reflecting his broader vision of systemic reform.</div>
