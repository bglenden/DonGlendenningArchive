  D1 What Gets Measured
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Don argues reading is a key skill and proposes high school graduation requires demonstrated reading proficiency at specified levels: ability to read diverse printed material including newspaper editorial pages &quot;with independence, fluency and ease.&quot; He notes reading ability can be measured using available reading scales and proposes making these scales widely accessible to students, parents, and employers. Don advocates elevating reading&#x27;s profile by making it a separate required subject with clear performance levels, adjusted school schedules ensuring each student receives needed support, regular feedback to learner and parents, and minimum proficiency as graduation requirement. He also proposes students should challenge for credit at any time. Don concludes by positioning these steps as demonstrating PEI&#x27;s seriousness about education and reading&#x27;s significance in learning. This letter shows his practical approach to implementing measurement-based education reform and his conviction that standards, assessment, and feedback must be transparent to all stakeholders.</div>

<p>Dear Sir:</p>
<p>What gets measured…</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span>Reading is a key skill; it can be learned and no student should be given a high school graduation diploma unless they are “</span>able<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>to read a range of printed material, including the editorial pages of their daily paper, with independence, fluency and ease”.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>(I am aware that some readers question the use of fluency as a measure of reading.)</p>
<p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The ability to read can be also measured and, as a colleague was wont to say, “What gets measured gets taught”.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I’ve seen a number of reading scales; they should be made generally available to students and parents; employers would likely find them useful as well.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There’s no reason, either, why a learner shouldn’t be told their personal score.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Also,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>in my view, reading deserves a higher profile in our school system <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>By higher profile, I mean,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>make reading a separate and required subject, identify clear and measurable levels of performance, rejig school schedules to ensure each student receives the help needed, provide regular feedback to the learner and parents, and require a minimum proficiency before granting diplomas. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I also believe that there should be an option at any time to challenge for credit.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The above steps would serve notice that PEI is serious about education, and believes that reading is a significant factor in the education process.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Comments are welcomed either in a letters to the editor or to me at<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>HYPERLINK "mailto:standards2020@gmail.com" <span>standards2020@gmail.com</span>.</p>
