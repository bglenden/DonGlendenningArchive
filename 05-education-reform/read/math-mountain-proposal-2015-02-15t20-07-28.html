<div class="reader-summary">An extensive proposal using the metaphor of Mount Mathematics to advocate for creating a structured math proficiency ladder with clearly identified achievement levels. It proposes establishing an independent assessment service, conducting comprehensive competency analysis, developing rating scales, and creating performance-based assessment systems comparable to music or figure skating certification models.</div>

<p><b>Mount Mathematics</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Background:</b></p>
<p>Islanders are concerned about the quality of their public education with these concerns arising most recently<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>from PISA test results, a recent survey by The Community Foundation of Prince Edward Island, concerns expressed by the Greater Charlottetown Area Chamber. A survey by the Prince Edward Island Home and School Federation, and a series of workshops held through the Island by Education 20/20.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>So far, the Department has neither responded<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>to nor refuted the claims, nor has it made public any plans to address them.</p>
<p><br></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li7">f particular concern are the recent graduates whose level of basic skills prevents them from entering post-secondary studies or securing employment. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li7">The practice of social promotion puts make it difficult to compare levels across institutions</li>
  <li class="li7">Difficult for employers and posecondary levels to s a screening instrument when hiring</li>
  <li class="li7">School report cards lack adequate description of levels of achievement</li>
  <li class="li7">Recognized service would facilitate labour mobility</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p>Arising out of a series of discussions with employers and educators came</p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <ul class="ul1">
    <ul class="ul1">
      <ul class="ul1">
        <li class="li6">Preparing a math ladder with clearly identified rungs indicating a known level of achievemen</li>
        <li class="li6">Developing an independent assessment service to to establish the levels<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
  </ul>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Proposal:<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span></b>Create a math ladder for use by ICreate a way to help more students reach higher levels in mathematics assessteaching institution to establish performance levels of studentsnt</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Why Math?</b></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li6">Needed for day-to-day living and is often a prerequisite for accessing many opportunities in later life</li>
  <li class="li6">Has an identifiable structure namely<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>numeracy, elementary mathematics, algebra, geometry, trigonometry, calculus, set and function, complex numbers, logarithmic functions, and infinite series</li>
  <li class="li6">Lacks a widely available and accepted analysis of outcomes or competencies</li>
  <li class="li6">Lack widely accepted agreement on levels</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Steps:</b></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li6">Establish a project steering committee</li>
  <li class="li6">Secure an<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>analysis of field</li>

</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li6">S benchmsrk level could be the nature and extent of mathematics needed to be citizen of PEI in 20/20</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Advantages/benefits:</b></p>
<ul class="ul1">

<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Educational issues:</b></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li6">Great energy expended in trying to decide in advance an appropriate elevation for students in each grade</li>
  <li class="li6">Lacks logic</li>
  <li class="li6">Open to interpretation by various users</li>
  <li class="li6">Altitudes attained are open to interpretation</li>
  <li class="li6">No national standard</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Math:</b></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li6">Math as a mountain</li>
  <li class="li6">It is a prerequisite for accessing opportunities in later life</li>
  <li class="li6">Structure: <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>numeracy, elementary mathematics, algebra, geometry, trigonometry, calculus, set and function, complex numbers, logarithmec functions, and infinite series</li>
  <li class="li6"><b>Why climb Math Mountain: </b>It is a prerequisite for accessing opportunities in later life</li>
  <li class="li6">Cannot find listing of either outcomes or competencies</li>
  <li class="li6">Complete analysis needed before</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Proposal:</b></p>
<p>Develop a tool to educators</p>
<p><br></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li6"><b>Undertake an analysis:</b></li>
</ul>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li6">Levels as described by PISA</li>
  <li class="li6">Provincial may offer other courses as well but they must have different identity</li>
  <li class="li6">Similar to establishing levels in music and skating</li>
  <li class="li6">Independent assessment service</li>
  <li class="li6">Learners apply when ready</li>
  <li class="li6">Establish benchmark</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li6"><b>Establish levels</b></li>
</ul>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li6">Levels – link with PCAP or OECD if possible</li>

  <li class="li6">Aid mobility</li>
  <li class="li6">Much of groundwork already done</li>
  <li class="li6">Reduce curriculum development workload</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Project:</b></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li6">Establish committee</li>

<p>Provincial assessments are conducted yearly and tell us how well students are doing at key stages of learning. Students are assessed in reading, writing and mathematics at the end of Grade 3, Grade 6, and Grade 9. We also have an assessment called Early Years Evaluation (EYE) that takes place before a child goes into kindergarten.  <br>
<br>
These assessments are developed by teachers from across the province and are based on the curriculum used in Island schools. They tell us how well students are learning the curriculum, where students may need help, and how resources may be directed to improve our education system.<br>
<br>
Provincial assessments are just one of many tools used to monitor student learning. Parents should talk to the teacher about the full scope of their child’s performance. Working together with good information, parents and teachers can help students to reach their full potential.<br>
<br>
The Department of Education and Early Childhood Development also supports a national assessment which takes place every three years. The Pan-Canadian Assessment Program (PCAP) assesses the performance of Grade 8 students in reading, math and science.<br>
<br>
Every three years, Island students also take part in the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA), which assesses the achievement of 15-year-old students in reading, math and science through a common international test.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p>Provincial assessments are conducted yearly and tell us how well students are doing at key stages of learning. Students are assessed in reading, writing and mathematics at the end of Grade 3, Grade 6, and Grade 9. We also have an assessment called Early Years Evaluation (EYE) that takes place before a child goes into kindergarten.  <br>
<br>
These assessments are developed by teachers from across the province and are based on the curriculum used in Island schools. They tell us how well students are learning the curriculum, where students may need help, and how resources may be directed to improve our education system.<br>
<br>
Provincial assessments are just one of many tools used to monitor student learning. Parents should talk to the teacher about the full scope of their child’s performance. Working together with good information, parents and teachers can help students to reach their full potential.<br>
<br>
The Department of Education and Early Childhood Development also supports a national assessment which takes place every three years. The Pan-Canadian Assessment Program (PCAP) assesses the performance of Grade 8 students in reading, math and science.<br>
<br>
Every three years, Island students also take part in the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA), which assesses the achievement of 15-year-old students in reading, math and science through a common international test.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
