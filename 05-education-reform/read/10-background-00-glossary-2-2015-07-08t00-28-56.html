<p><b>GLOSSARY &amp; DEFINITIONS</b></p>
<p>Diploma, according to Wikipedia, is of Greek origin meaning a "folded paper", and is a document</p>
<p>issued by an educational institution indicating that the holder has completed a certain</p>
<p>programme of studies; degrees are also granted by educational institutions on a similar basis.</p>
<p>Degrees and diplomas are considered credentials in that they may provide entrance into an</p>
<p>arena but are not an indicator of how well one will perform once there.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>A qualification, on the other hand, speaks to the issue of attitudes, skills and knowledge</p>
<p>required to successfully perform in a role or at a task. Employment advertisements often</p>
<p>identify both a credential, such as a high school diploma, and a set of qualifications usually</p>
<p>including training and or experience. ln order to teach, one also needs a credential, a university</p>
<p>degree, and a qualification, a teaching licence, the latter attesting to one's ability to teach.</p>

<p><b>Competencies and Learning Outcomes</b></p>
<p>by David Gosselin, University of Nebraska-Lincoln</p>
<p>Competencies and learning outcomes are two related educational terms that can create confusion. Competencies and outcomes can be written to describe the learning gained by students in individual courses (course outcomes) or for the program as a whole (program outcomes). They DO NOT mean the same thing. We will follow the lead of<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>HYPERLINK "http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1541-4329.2004.tb00047.x/pdf" <span>Hartel and Foegeding (2004)</span> and use the following working definitions:</p>
