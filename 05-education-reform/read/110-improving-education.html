  110 Improving education
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Draft advocating structural interventions to improve PEI education: school autonomy, system accountability, learner-centered focus, functional clarity, and supportive learning culture. Expresses confidence in emerging political climate and urges party leaders to establish common understanding of educational issues, definitions, and underlying principles, noting agreement on fundamentals would be valuable even if comprehensive consensus isn&#x27;t achieved.</div>

<p><b>Improving public education</b></p>
<p><b>D-110</b></p>
<p><b>One does not have to look very long or very far to realize that confusion exists in the operation of education services in PEI; (1) Adding “Lifelong” and<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Early Childhood” to the name of the Department raises questions about the views of politicians and the educators who advise them. (2) Describing the<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Department’s role as one “developing and delivering programs” simply confirms the narrowness of the view. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The practice of using education and what happens in schools” interchangeably” leads me to the conclusion that the chances of the education system improving itself are highly unlikely.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Let me say that I blame neither politicians nor educators for allowing or causing the current start of affairs; I am perplexed, however, by their unwillingness or inability to institute improvements.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The political need for announcements seems to over-ride the educational need for “underlying principles” – and the “fear factor” probably outweighs all others. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>In the view of the writer, central to improving education,are the following structural interventions:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li3"><b>Autonomy<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>of schools and learning centres for their day to day operation</b></li>
  <li class="li3"><b>Accountability throughout the system for services rendered</b></li>
  <li class="li3"><b>Helping learners be the prime focus of all activities</b></li>
  <li class="li3"><b>Functional clarity throughout the system</b></li>
  <li class="li3"><b>A culture that supports learning.</b></li>
</ul>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>I am impressed with the<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>emerging political<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>climate and suggest, as a place to start, that party leaders come together to develop a common understanding of educational issues to include definitions of common educational terms, a statement of beliefs and underlying, or overarching principles.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>While it would be great if such activityled od agreement, the fact that such issues were discussed, would be extremely useful it its own right.</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Sincerely</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Don Glendenning</b></p>
<p><b>A long-time student of education</b></p>
