<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">In
late 2013, The Community Foundation of Prince Edward Island (CFPEI)
undertook a survey of over 200 Island youth to identify issues that
directly affect them; the report, T<u>aking
the Pulse of Island Youth</u>,
available on the Foundation<span lang="en-US">’s</span>
website at <u><a href="http://www.cfpei.ca/">www.cfpei.ca</a>,</u>
provides a snapshot of the findings.  Bright
spots include a positive sense of community, emerging entrepreneurial
spirit, volunteerism and new postsecondary offerings. The main
concerns include a lack of jobs, surviving on low-paying jobs,
educational deficiencies and drug and alcohol addictions.  On the
subject of education and learning, the study reports a high rate of
completion of high school and postsecondary education, a high level
of inclusivity and relatively affordable tuition costs; young people
also  expressed concerns about their readiness for the next stage of
life including:

<p align="justify" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Following
the publication of the CFPEI Report, Education 20/20 organized six
public discussions for the purpose of informing the community of the
report and its findings, learning more about youth issues in our
communities, exploring issues of education and learning, and to
identify actions to be taken to close gaps.  Discussions were lively
and wide ranging, and carried on well after the formal session ended.
  The final report included a recommendation that.

20/20 has continued its exploration under the title, “basic
skills”, meaning those skills required of any and all citizens, and
considered foundational to all other learning.  Basic skills are an
issue because:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Content
	and levels are not consistently defined</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Low
	basic skill levels drag down the economy of PEI</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">There
	is an added expense of re-teaching them at the postsecondary level. 
	</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">The
	skill identification process appears to be repeated at each level of
	education

	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Responsibility
	for education is scattered across a number of agencies.</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Basic
	skills do not appear to be a priority</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">A
	low level of basic skills may not only block entrance to
	postsecondary education but may also lower skill levels of people

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in"><span lang="en-US">Education
20/20has has searched the literature, examined curriculum materials
from a variety of institutions and Provinces and at various levels,
reviewed achievement levels and assessment procedures for the OECD
sponsored PISA assessment, Canada’s PCAP assessment, TOWES and
others, seeking a foundation document, an analysis identifying
competencies to be learned.  One would think that, with all the
curriculum development activities in Departments of Education across
the country, a suitable foundation document would exist; based on our
examination, it doesn’t.  Provinces develop curriculum based on
outcomes and, it is our considered view, that outcomes are too broad
a level and do not lend themselves to common understanding and
measurement lack readily identified assessment criteria ;</span>
the format  of outcomes used  by schools is at odds with the original
as conceived by William Spady and later proponents of Outcomes Based
Education.  An outcome is a clear statement of expectations at the
end of a learning experience; a competency is one form of outcome but
one that focuses more directly on what happens to learners.  By
chance, we discovered a competency based analysis of Practical
Mathematics prepared some time ago for Holland College and the PEI
Department of Education; we propose to convene a committee of
citizens to update this analysis rather than start from Scratch.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in"><span lang="en-US">As a point of
departure, we further narrowed our view to mathematics in the belief
that it carries less cultural baggage, was a key field of student
education for the information age and is of interest to people from a
variety of institutions.</span></p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><span lang="en-US"><b>Proposal:</b></span></p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><span lang="en-US">Undertake
a comprehensive analysis of competencies in the field of mathematics
used or needed by citizens.  We are calling this document a
”curriculum map” that will serve as a master list of competencies
for different users. Teachers may use the list to identify what is to
be learned, students to track what has been learned, and curriculum
developers as an analysis of the field, employers to identify the
expectations of a new employee, and credentialing and qualifications
bodies as a basis for their work.     </span>The
analysis process will be based on DACUM (<b>D</b>eveloping
<u><b>A</b></u>
 <u><b>CU</b></u>rriculu<u><b>M</b></u>),
originally developed as part of a Nova Scotia NewStart project on
Yarmouth, Nova Scotia but pioneered by Holland College in
Charlottetown</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><br />

</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Finally,
and absolutely critical to our project, is a rating scale based on
externally referenced criteria; we are very familiar with this
component and confident in our ability to design this element of the
project.</p>

<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">On
