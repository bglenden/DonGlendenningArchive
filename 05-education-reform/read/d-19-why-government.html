  D-19 why government...

<div class="reader-summary">Don questions whether government should directly operate schools, recounting a conversation where inadequate rationales emerged (historical precedent, provincial reach, patronage). He contends governments should provide governance, financing, leadership, and information while being better served to delegate school operations, pointing to successful alternatives in higher education, private schools, and charter schools where students perform adequately.</div>

<p>Dear Sir:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><span>Why does government run our public schools?</span></p>
<p>Several years ago I was having coffee with friends on my cottage deck when the conversation turned to education.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Someone asked the question, “Why does government run our schools?”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There was a period of silence as we looked at each other.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As I recall three answers were ventured. “Government has always run out schools, government is the only organization with the needed provincial reach, and running schools gives government a sense of power (and patronage opportunities)”.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I’ve thought of that discussion a number of time, and the fact that we were not able to muster stronger arguments in support of government’s operational role.</p>
<p>Governments have a role, in fact an important role, in ensuring govrtnance, financing, leadership gathering and providing information, ensuring that education has the technology and products,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>human resources.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The problem is that it is so busy running schools that never gets to the only tasks that it can do.</p>
<p>Perhaps delegate the operation of schools to municipalotoesThere a number of things that government should doGovernment</p>
<p>Colleges and universities seem to get along well under boards of governors, students from private schools seem to fare well, students in charter schools on average seem to do as well as those in public schools and most if not all examples of home schooling I encounter seems to work. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>In the meantime, our students continue to attend schools that no longer serve them well.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p><br></p>

<p>A long-time student of education</p>
