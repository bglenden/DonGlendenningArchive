<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">I
am pleased to provide a letter of support for the nomination of Alice
M. Taylor for the PEI
Senior Islander of the Year Award.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><span lang="en-CA">Alice
</span>retired
as head of the Early Childhood Education Department at Holland
College after <span lang="en-CA">35 years
as an early childhood educator, college instructor and life coach;
under her leadership, the Early Childhood Education program became
recognized as a quality program at the cutting edge of the field.
Alice </span>didn’t
just deliver quality instruction, she also “walked the talk” in
that her program modelled what she expected her students to do and be
when they had students of their own.<span lang="en-CA">
 The program quickly gained recognition beyond PEI and soon included
students from other Provinces as well.  Alice was and still is the
classic lifelong learner; hers was a sandwich education of work and
study and even though retired, she continues to keep on top of her
field. The early childhood sector in PEI today owes a debt to Alice
Taylor, and the Early Childhood program she led, for the presence of
well-qualified ECE teachers in Centres across the Island.</span>

</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><span lang="en-US">Not
surprising, her insights and services were in high demand and she was
often a guest speaker and resource person, served on many boards and
committees including the Kindergarten Transition Team during the
recent expansion of Kindergarten programs, played a leadership role
in the formation of the Early Childhood Development Association and
was president for a four year period.  As well, she is a published
co-author, along with Psychologist, </span>Ken Pierce, of The
Dance of Bullying; she continues to advance the
anti-bullying agenda in society</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Alice
is a founding member and Secretary Treasurer of Education 20/20 Inc.,
an independent, broad based,
national, not-for-profit education organization, located in
Charlottetown, PEI but with national incorporation and national
aspirations; the focus of the organization is on ensuring a
quality education for every Canadian, her record fits the mandate
precisely.  Every new organization needs capable,
experienced, wise and willing members who are committed to the cause
and prepared to give above and beyond the call of duty.  Not
surprising, Alice is always ready to do her part – plus a bit more.</p>

<span lang="en-US">Alice
is a firm believer in the centrality of the learner in the teaching
learning process, the importance of social and emotional awareness
and the connections between mind, body, spirit and human growth and
development.  In this regard, Alice has been one of the leaders in
the research, development and implementation of the Handle with Care
program, a program designed to help parents and caregivers promote
good mental health among children under the age of six.  Her
commitment to Early Childhood Education in general and the Handle
with Care Program in particular, is outstanding. And her leadership
in its expansion throughout PEI and the Maritime Provinces appears to
have no limits.</span></p>
<p style="widows: 2; margin-left: 0.5in; orphans: 2; margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<span lang="en-CA">What always strikes me about Alice is the breadth
and depth of her engagement, first of all with her family which is
scattered all over North America, then with her community including
in the Strawberry Hill Green Community in Stratford, her book club
and, along with her husband, Park Royal United Church.  Alice has
lived through many trends and philosophies, and, given her breadth of
interest and experience, can offer the wisdom of being part of those
trends and their likely effects on issues of the day. </span>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">I
have known Alice for many years and could describe her qualities in
many ways; she is knowledgeable, engaging, open minded, perceptive,
and caring for others, especially for children.  In terms of this
award, however, perhaps the best way to describe her would be as a
senior who continues to be engaged, not just in her community, but
engaged in making our community a better place for all of us.  In the
words of a colleague, Alice is a mother, grandmother, entrepreneur
and “Wise Women” who is looked up to by peers and younger persons
alike, a champion of respect and self-esteem</p>
