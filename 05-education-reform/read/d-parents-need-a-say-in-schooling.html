  D Parents need a say in Schooling
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Comparing education to healthcare, Don argues schools suffer from system-centered rather than client-centered culture. Parents feel excluded from meaningful dialogue about their children&#x27;s learning. Unlike healthcare where patients receive individualized attention, education treats students as batch-processed. He notes public discussion focuses on schooling logistics (bussing, schedules, storm days) rather than learning outcomes. He contrasts this with doctors&#x27; question &quot;What can I do for you?&quot; which schools never ask. This piece captures his frustration with institutional inflexibility and client-unresponsiveness.</div>

<p>Dear Sir:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Public needs a say in Schooling</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The Globe and Mail on Wednesday, February 9 carried an article by Andre Picard on “Why patients need a say in their health care”.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The article describes a culture in the health care system “where the needs of the system almost always take precedence over those of the individual patient”. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Furthermore, it is a culture where “patients don’t get choices, where dialogue is discouraged, where patient-provider relationships are fleeting, and where investing in customer service is not a priority.” Many parents feel the same way about public schools.</p>
<p>We know that student performance and student engagement go together.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A quality education benefits from public engagement, a characteristic virtually absent in public education. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Dialogue is not a characteristic of public education;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p>Education, more so than any other government service such as health or justice, suffer from being a government dominated delivery system. Bureaucrats decide what should be taught by whom and when; and teachers are leaving teachersecisionsWhat is to be learned and who will teach it, along with thContent is determined by government along with teacher licensing, hours of operation, choice of schools, ; most questions and any apparent criticism, it seems, automatically becomes a political issue., it seemsdiscussion When I visit my doctor, he usually opens the conversation with, ”What can I do for you today?”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I cannot remember ever being asked that question by a teacher; neither can I ever remember asking it – but I believe I should have.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Most of the public discussion is about schooling, not education, but even there discussion seems to centre on issues of<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>mold, bussing, test scores, exam schedules, PD days, storm days, etc.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Seldom do we read about improving reading, building vocabulary, developing analysis skills. or improving work habits.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>In the words of the late Herb Leavitt, a ong time school trustee from Alberton, “We seem to spend most of our school board meeting time discussing where we should purchase our bus tires.”</p>
