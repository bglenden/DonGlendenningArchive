  28 Storage of children 
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Don references a New Zealand Herald article about schools as &quot;storage lockers&quot; for children while parents work, using it to examine schools&#x27; evolving role. He proposes that schools must address three mandates: (1) helping Islanders develop citizenship attitudes, skills and knowledge; (2) developing people for community needs; and (3) providing childcare &quot;housed, happy and out of harm&#x27;s way.&quot; Don calls for this multi-dimensional mandate to be explicitly included in future PEI educational philosophy discussions, acknowledging that custodial services now substantially shape how family life is organized.</div>

<p>Editor,</p>
<p>Charlottetown Guardian</p>
<p>Charlottetown, PEI	</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Dear Sir:</p>
<p><b>The changing role of schools</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>The New Zealand Herald on Monday, April 13, 2015 carried an article by Matt Heath on “School: a great storage locker for our children”. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>While it was a light hearted look at how to cope with having your children home during vacation or storm days, it does raise the issue of schools providing care for children while parents work.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Without doubt, family activities are organized around the expectation that schools will care for children during most working days.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>This leads to a three-part mandate for<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>schools of the future:</p>
<p>Help every Islander develop the attitudes, skills and knowledge needed for citizenship</p>
<p>Help develop the people we need to secure future of our community, and</p>
<p>Keep “kids housed, happy and out of harm's way all day” while parents work”</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>When the election dust settles and a philosophy of education for PEI is being written, I hope this issue will be included in the terms of reference.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p><br></p>
