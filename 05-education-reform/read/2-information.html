<p><b>Dear Sir:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b><b></b></p>
<p><b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p>Of all education services available to Islanders, information appears to rank lowest in importance.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I was pleased, therefore, to see the issue addressed in the recent Review of Prince d Island’s Provincial Common Assessment Program prepared recently by RMJ Assessment for the Department of Education.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The Report noted the lack of information, even “confusion” about assessment among the public and recommended that the issue be addressed; educators<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>need to provide more information about <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>what they do and why. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Another part of the shortfall, I suggest, involves information needed by Islanders when making decisions about their own education or that of their family.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As readers may recall, lack of information was one of the issues identified in a recent study of continuing education in Souris ( HYPERLINK "http://www.education2020.ca" <span>www.education2020.ca</span>); this kind of information is often combined with counselling.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Providing information for decision-making should not be limited to or through schools; many out-of-school Islanders need help as well. Information services could easily be incorporated into a separate structure,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>through<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>our libraries or be provided by privately operated centres as is the case in workforce development.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>My personal experience suggests that Improving the information flow between providers and users of education services is likely one of the keys to better education in the 21<sup>st</sup> century.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Sincerely,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
