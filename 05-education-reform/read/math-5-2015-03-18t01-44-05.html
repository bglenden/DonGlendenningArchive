<p><b>Proposals-5</b></p>
<p><b>Math description<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>BACKGROUND</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Education</b></p>
<p>It is widely recognized that education is a key factor in determining one’s quality of life; in the same way, the collective education of our citizens determines to a significant degree the future of our community and country. Our education system developed over decades and served us well, however, education now finds itself in a changed and rapidly changing world, an <span>international market place a knowledge economy with instant communication at our fingertips and cultural sensitivities and</span> appears not to have the capacity to make the transition</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>School system</b></p>
<p>The PEI school system is not unlike that in sister provinces with modern schools, qualified teachers, a a reasonable level of financial support; emphasis on knowledge, isolated from the society it serveswe expect that the range of school quality is not unlike that of sister provinces.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Heavy user of approaches developed in out lsrger provinces But we think that we need to do better.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Problems not unique to PEI</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Characteristics of the system that prevent it from making the required changes:</p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li6">Politicization</li>
  <li class="li6">Bureaucratic</li>
  <li class="li6">School focus.</li>
  <li class="li6">Unwilling or unable to develop skills needed for daily living</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Concerns</b></p>
<p><b>Literacy</b></p>
<p>Concerns among Islanders have been widely reported: need to elaborate, to mention a few|</p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li5">PISA results</li>
  <li class="li5">CFPEI survey</li>
  <li class="li5">Charlottetown Area chamber</li>
  <li class="li5">Home and School</li>
  <li class="li5">Education 20/20 workshops</li>
  <li class="li5">PEILA statistics</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p>While schools cannot be expected to teach all students everything, it seems reasonable to expect<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>schools to ensue that its students have a range of skills at a level to function in a modern economy</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>interfere with the Although literacy is and has been the subject of considerable attention for a number of years, the level of sPEI puts a major Essential skills a major concern</p>
<p>Considerable effort into essential skills and employability skills for adults</p>
<p>Been adopted by some schools but none in PEI</p>
<p>Believe there is a way to link essential skills and school grades, d</p>
<p>Doing so would not only help graduates prepare for work and further studies but also reduce the vast sums spent on essential skills by later levels?</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Between what Islanders have and what they want in the way of education.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Not only is there a gap, but Islanders want meaningful engagement in bringing about the change. There is no panacea in sight and there is not likely to be one, however, change must be immediate, significant and continuous, but planned.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And foundational to all of this are the basic skills required by every citizen to live in and contribute to his or her community.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Within the basic skills cluster, Education 20/20 Inc. has identified mathematics as the place to start</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Flaws in the system:</p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li5">Conflict between teaching and sorting</li>
  <li class="li5">Lack of service mentality</li>
  <li class="li5">Age based grading</li>
  <li class="li5">Llack of criterion referenced criteria</li>
  <li class="li5">Rating scales</li>
  <li class="li5">Documentation</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>We are of the view that:</p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li5">The education system is unlikely Educational achievement can and should be measured in terms other than time spent on a subject or in school.</li>
  <li class="li5">Credentials are no longer an adequate instrument to describe depth or breadth of study in a subject or field.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li5">The practice of having teachers act as both coach and referee of their own students is unfair to student</li>
</ul>
<p>System as now structured is unlikely to produce students with the skills needed to function in a modern economy</p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li5">Math is studied at all grade levels, and in both College and UPEI; It would be advantageous to students, therefore, if all institutions and accreditation agencies operated from the same master list of competencies.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Proposal</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>Establish a qualification authority, a separate authority for the purpose certifying individual levels of achievement.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The role of teaching is designed to help others learn; when a teachers rank their students they are putting their ability to teach at risk.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This includes the matter of assigning student grades, selecting students for prizes and awarding diplomas and degrees.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We propose a separate qualification authority for the purpose certifying individual levels of achievement. Examples of a proper relationship between the two functions is that of apprenticeship and music. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p><b>MATHEMATICS</b></p>

<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Why study Math</b></p>
<p>John Paulos, mathematician, believes that we should study math because it is:</p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li5"><i>“Useful:</i></li>
  <ul class="ul1">
    <li class="li14"><i>Mathematical problems abound in daily life</i></li>
    <li class="li14"><i>Mathematical proficiency is required for many jobs</i></li>
    <li class="li14"><i>Mathematics is essential for science, engineering, and research</i></li>
  </ul>
  <li class="li14"><i>Important:</i></li>
  <ul class="ul1">
    <li class="li14"><i>A mathematically informed citizenry will make better economic and political decisions about risk, policy, and resource allocation</i></li>
  </ul>
  <li class="li14"><i>Interesting:</i></li>
  <ul class="ul1">
    <li class="li14"><i>"Mathematics, rightly viewed, </i><span><i>possesses not only truth, but supreme beauty</i></span><i>" (Bertrand Russell) and should be studied in its own right</i></li>
    <li class="li14"><i>The landmark accomplishments of mathematics stand alongside the masterworks of art and music as cultural triumphs that all educated persons should be able to appreciate</i></li>
    <li class="li14"><i>Doing mathematics teaches patterns of problem-solving and insight that transfer to other knowledge domains</i></li>
    <li class="li15"><i>Mathematical proof teaches skills in rigor, argumentation and persuasion that transfer to other knowledge domains”</i></li>
  </ul>
</ul>

<p><b>Levels<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>differ because of Improvement in math includes 2 elements:</b></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li6">Ability to perform existing competencies at a higher lever</li>
  <li class="li6">Ability<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>to perform additional competencies</li>

<p><b>Conclusions</b></p>
<p>Education 20/20 .Inc. proposes a concerted effort to improve math skills for Islanders of all ages by identifying inherent stages in the” math mountain”; four-step process to include:</p>
<p><br></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li6">Comprehensive analysis of math competencies <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li6">Development of rating scale or scales that<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>can be applied to each competency<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li6">Establishing identifiable levels of performance (combination of competencies and levels); ideally, the<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>school system should organize stage based student instruction)</li>
</ul>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li6">Establish a testing service to assess achievement in mathematics for any Islander who needs or wants it.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
</ul>
