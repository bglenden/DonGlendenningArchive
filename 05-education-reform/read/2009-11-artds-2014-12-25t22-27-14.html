<p>Dear Sir</p>
<p><b>High School for the Arts</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>First let me offer my congratulations to Tessa Mossey and Ben Moran whose accomplishments</p>
<p>as theatre students at the Walnut Hill School were reported in Saturday's Guardian.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>My other reason for writing, however, is to put forward the idea of a High School for the Arts in PEI; u,e are able to attract people to the Culinary Institute, College of Piping, Atlantic Police</p>
<p>Academy, Atlantic Veterinary College, and others, so why not to a centre for training people in</p>
<p>the arts. With the recent school closings, finding space should not be a problem.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The arts add significantly to our quality of life, are recognized as a major contributor to</p>
<p>individual development, provide opportunities for rewarding careers, are a welcome change from work routines, allow for individual creativity and constitute an important part of our economy.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Most of the above schools, perhaps all, came into being as a result of collaboration between,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>government, the community to be served, the private sector and an educational institution. The</p>
<p>same mix would be appropriate for a new venture. Leadership may come from any of the</p>
<p>stakeholders.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Information about Walnut Hill School may be found at r,vr,vr.i,.walnuthillarts.org. Similar schools operate in Canada; a quick search of the internet turned up thirty. Some schools are part of the regular system, others are private and some operate as charter schools.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Let the planning begin.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Don Glendenning.</p>
