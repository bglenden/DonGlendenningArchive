<p>General Manager</p>

<p><br></p>
<p>Dear Mr. Gillis:		</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Please consider this letter a request for financial support for Education 20/20 Inc., a national, not-for-profit education organization, located in Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Since we last spoke, Education 20/20 Inc. has continued its work in support of change, especially change in public education. It is our view that much remains to be done.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Our objective is to ensure a quality education for every Canadian; that means bringing about<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>change, not an easy task<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>for an external organization.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Most of the initial impediments to change in public education are structural; by that, we mean a school system masquerading as an education system, an out-of-date and out-of-tune philosophy of education, an out dated management system, goals and outcomes too vague for meaning and measurement, a teaching model that delivers instruction developed and packaged in the Holman Building in Summerside rather than a<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>developmental model that responds to learner needs, floating standards light on externally referenced criteria,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>a monopoly that survives primarily because it is mandatory, a system tha values conformity over competence and is kept alive it seems by politicians, senior bureaucrats and the teachers’ unions. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Oneif the initial objrctives of Education 20/20 Inc. is to supply stakeholders with relevant ideas and information</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Rt this stage of our development dTools for change include independent and relevant Information, active engagement of educators with the community they serve, recognition for innovative<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>people and organizations, demonstration projects a point in ourd research. Our efforts to date have been<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>primarily in providing relevant and independent information in the form of a monthly bilingual newsletter, a website,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>meetings with a variety of individuals and organizations, presentations to the Minister of Education<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>and the English Language School Board, occasional workshops and public presentations.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We have also published a seven-point Call<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>for Action and, thanks to the generosity, established an Excellence in Education Award with a cash value of $2,500. We want to sharpen and focus existing tools and add a few others</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Also attached is a copy of our plans for the coming year.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In addition to <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>continue and expand existing activitiesfrom which I would like to highlight three new initiatives.</p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li6">Educators tend to be “silo” based especially when it comes to their profession; yet the literature repeatedly informs us of the need for and value of engagement.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Furthermore, yhe onus is usually placed on the teacher and school to be the initiators. We plan to change that and, on behalf of parents, and the public in general, initiate organize activities to bring the two together. The top priority, as we<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>see it, is to bring educatiors who sit in leadership positions to inform us of the work in which they are engaged<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>the initiative they lead.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This, we believe, will generate both information and understanding of the working of the education system.ionitiate the engagement action.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>, student to student, teacher to student, teacher to teacher, school to community to name but a few.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The literatureSunshine Sessions</li>
  <li class="li6">Issue based Round tables Exchanges</li>

</ul>
<p>and is moving into the social media</p>
<p><br></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li6">Established an Excellence in Education Award with a cash value of<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>$2,500</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The nature and quality of education will, to a large extent, determine our future as individuals, communities and countries. Education First is convinced that education is important, that improvement is needed and that there is wide support for change.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Although education systems are instituting changes, the changes fall short of what is actually required; changes fail to deal with a number of underlying weaknesses.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Furthermore, the required changes are not likely to happen unless the public demands it. Traditional efforts to bring about change have not worked.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Some innovative, perhaps even bold, measures are required, but we think that a better education system is worth it and we’d like to play a leading role in making change happen.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>While we have identified many entry points into the change process, we propose to commence with the following:</p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li6">A monthly electronic newsletter, copy attached. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li6">A public participation survey using recently developed Canadian community engagement software.</li>
  <li class="li6">A series of occasional papers on subjects of interest to the public such as reading, standards, school autonomy, etc., and</li>
  <li class="li6">Educational leadership awards for individuals, institutions and organizations that demonstrate best practices.</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p>Information is the fuel for change; it doesn’t guarantee change but certainly supports it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Our health, for example, is the subject of frequent media articles about cancer, diabetes, Alzheimers, the dangers of smoking as well as matters relating to our local health services.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In comparison, information items in the media about education tend to be operational matters only, bus service, school closings, school construction and professional development days.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There is nothing in the local media equivalent to the monthly section on matters of health.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>In gathering and presenting information, we propose to engage people, especially teachers in training, in the preparation of occasional papers – <b>on topics of our choice</b>.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We’ve had some informal discussion with the UPEI Dean of Education about the matter and are hopeful that something can be worked out.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And there are other ways of approaching the information deficit including debates, competitions, presentations, etc.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>We also are pleased to announce that the Community Foundation of Prince Edward Island supports our educational initiatives.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As a result, contributions to Education First Canada Inc. will be receipted and administered by the Foundation.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Our group cannot make this happen alone; we need your help – both encouragement and financial support and preferably over a three year period.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I would welcome an opportunity to meet, to provide more details about our plans. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I’ll be in touch within the next few days seeking an appointment.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
<p><br></p>
