  Technology EDUCATION
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">(169 words):** Don advocates &quot;Technology Education&quot; as modern terminology replacing &quot;Industrial Arts,&quot; supporting its emergence as curriculum requirement. He positions technology as neutral discipline—like social studies, communications, mathematics—rather than vocational-specific. Don argues a course&#x27;s vocational character derives from learner purpose (employment-seeking) rather than content; physics becomes vocational when pursued for employment preparation. He advocates secondary schools maintain technology alongside business, visual arts, health sciences, and applied arts courses. Technology clusters could encompass computers, fabrication, electronics, design, mechanics, energy. Don&#x27;s critical insight: a course&#x27;s academic or vocational character depends on instructor approach, not content. Physics taught academically differs from vocational physics through methodology and emphasis, not curriculum. This perspective challenged prevailing stigmatization of vocational education and positioned technology as respectable curriculum area accessible to all students regardless of post-secondary intent.</div>

<p>TECHNOLOGY EDUCATION</p>
<p>By Donald Glendenning</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>A recent issue of “School Shop” includes a number of articles on “Technology Education”.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>While the articles are US based, similar trends are occurring in Canada.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A number of provinces include technology in their curriculum, at both the junior and senior high school level.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In fact, the Globe and Mail carried an advertisement recently for a teacher of “technology” (the first I have seen).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In some cases, at least one technology course is required in order to graduate.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I have seen some of the course outlines, or have discussed this development with people in New Brunswick, Ontario, Alberta and Manitoba.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It seems to me that New Brunswick has been leading in Canada in this development (I am certain that colleagues from other provinces will soon set the record straight).</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Technology is the new “in” term to cover courses loosely known as industrial arts.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In fact, the American Association of Industrial Arts has now changed its name to International Technology Education Association.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It appears to be an appropriate umbrella term for the 1990’s – time will tell.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>	Technology education is for all.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is the study of the practical application of science to our work and leisure activities.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is a field of study that can be used to integrate a variety of other subjects.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Technology education can give concrete meaning to abstract principles, and mathematical formulas.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Technology education is for people of all ages and should be offered at elementary, junior and senior high school levels.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In fact, in some places, it is a required<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>course for high school graduation.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>	Industrial Arts was always considered part of general education.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Generally, it did not imply or require career choice.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Although in some quarters it was defined broadly enough to include in-depth study leading to employment, this was generally not the case.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>No one expected a person who had taken an industrial arts course to be employment ready.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>	Technology education, it seems to me, actually replaces the term industrial education.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is neutral in the sense that it does not limit the learner to exploration nor commit him/her to a program of career preparation.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It has a nice ring about it, it is modern, flexible, and, I would think, academically respectable.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I expect, and hope, that it will gradually replace the terms occupational or vocational in our secondary school system.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>	The previous comment may surprise many of you who know my long-term interest in and commitment to vocational education.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Even though I am retired, that interest and commitment remains.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I continue to believe that vocational education should be available to every person prior to leaving publicly funded education.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That means secondary schools have a responsibility to provide education to the 30% who drop out prior to graduation and probably another 30% who go to work after high schools and graduation rather than to college or university.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>	My reason for replacing vocational education with technology education is that technology is a discipline or sector and is consistent with other secondary school subjects, i.e., social studies, language arts, mathematics, electronics, technology, etc.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Subject matter is neither academic, general nor vocational.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In one sense, it is neutral.</p>
<p>	</p>
<p>	A course becomes vocational if you study it to help you secure income generating employment, to retain employment, or to advance or change fields.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Labeling courses in secondary schools as vocational or academic defies logic and the labeling process discourages student participation. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>	</p>
<p>	In addition to offering courses in technology, secondary schools should continue to offer courses in business, visual arts, health sciences, applied arts, etc.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Technology courses in the public school system should enable participants to:</p>
<p>develop awareness and literacy</p>
<p>develop computer skills</p>
<p>develop critical thinking and problem solving skills</p>
<p>experience technological applications</p>
<p>identify the impacts of technological change in their lives</p>
<p>explore further education and career opportunities</p>
<p>apply problem solving skills</p>
<p>integrate courses through technological pursuits</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Under this scenario, school subjects might be grouped under such headings as science, social studies, communications, business, technology, mathematics, etc.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A technology cluster could include courses in computers, material fabrication, electronics, design and drafting, mechanics, energy, etc.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Each of these can be broken into more discreet components.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>	Any one of the clusters or individual courses can be approached either as general or vocational education.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Physics, for example, can be considered part of general education or it can be taken as preparation for university and eventually to secure employment (vocational reasons).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The same can be applied to techno logy.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is the purpose for which the course is taken, not the content.</p>
<p>	</p>
<p>	Which determines whether a course is general or vocational?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>(The approach used by the instructor/teacher determines whether it is academic or practical.)</p>
