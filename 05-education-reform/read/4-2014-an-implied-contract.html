  4-2014 An implied contract
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Don explores the implicit contract between schools and students by analogy to professional relationships (lawyers, accountants, doctors). While professional contracts are clear, educational commitments are murky. He poses questions about what schools commit to: safe environment, 190 days of instruction, subject variety, minimum literacy/numeracy, diploma, college/university preparation, or work skills? Given mandatory attendance and heavy investment, he asks what students should expect in return, framing this as a fundamental policy question.</div>

<p>Editor,</p>
<p>Charlottetown Guardian</p>
<p>Charlottetown, PEI</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Dear Sir:</p>
<p><b>An implied contract</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>In the case of my lawyer, my accountant and my doctor I believe that, once they accept</p>
<p>me as a client, they are obligated to do whatever they can reasonably do to solve my</p>
<p>"problem"; they may help me directly, hand me over to a colleague or employee, or</p>
<p>refer me to a specialist. The commitment by the firm, I assume, will depend on the how</p>
<p>the firm is organized.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I believe that there is a similar implied commitment to each student by a teacher and a</p>
<p>school, but I am less clear as to what the commitment is for. My scan of the internet</p>
<p>was not very helpful although one school indicated that a student has a right to "be</p>
<p>educated (and) become a productive member of the community".</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>What might a school commitment be to each student?</p>
<p>A safe environment</p>
<p>190 days of instruction?</p>
<p>lnstruction in a variety of subjects?</p>
<p>A minimum level of literacy or numeracy?</p>
<p>A high school diploma</p>
<p>Skills needed to enter college and university?</p>
<p>Skills needed to enter work?</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>We require our young people to attend school and we invest heavily in educational</p>
<p>programming; what should each student expect in return?</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
