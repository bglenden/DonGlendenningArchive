<p><b>STANDARDIZED TESTING</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The debate on standardized testing is endless without any agreement in sight or any middle ground. Given the heat, if not light, cast by the debate, it may be time to step back and ask a few basic questions.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>“Why test?”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A teacher tests for two reasons – to diagnose or determine a learner’s current level as a basis for developing a teaching strategy. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Later a teacher tests to see if the strategy worked.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>All tests, like all learning are individual although often undertaken by a student in a group setting. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Test results are for the information and benefit of the teacher, student and parents.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Test results constitute personal information, just as personal as the results of medical tests. <span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Schools also test to sort or rank students although I’m not really sure why schools take on this responsibility.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In my view, sorting has nothing to do with education and has no place in schools. A teacher’s focus should be on helping a learner reach the desired level of achievement.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>All, or practically all, who enter are capable of reaching high levels of achievement.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If it takes one learner a few days longer than another to complete the program, so what?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The important thing is that students reach the desired level of performance. <span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>And what of standardized tests?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>People who plan and provide and pay for learning resources, the Minister and the bureaucracy, need information about actual and likely users of the education system so that they can make available learning resources and opportunities of the right kind and in the right mix.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Planners need to know the nature of learning assistance required, numbers requiring each kind of assistance, otherwise they cannot plan properly.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They likely also need to know specifics about reading levels, vocabulary, literacy, numeracy, etc. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Results may indicate some areas requiring attention or extra resources.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They may show weaknesses in some schools at certain levels within the system.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>While such information may prove embarrassing, it is important that such information come to light so that corrective action may be taken. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Given the extremely limited choice by users, I cannot see any other way of bringing shortcomings to light.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The final question is who needs to know the results of an individual’s tests.<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Obviously the learner and teacher, and the parents or guardians of young learners, and that is all.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>These people need to know because of their centrality to the learning process.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Beyond that, only the learner has the right to tell others or authorize the giving out of information. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Testing is an important part of the teaching learning process.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The purpose of our tests must be clear – especially to the learner.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Schools must test, or more accurately, teachers must test, in order to improve instruction.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As far as sorting or ranking, that practice should be discontinued immediately.</p>
