<p><b>DACUM: A CANADIAN CONTRIBUTION TO EDUCATION</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>

<p>A federal program to train Canadians expecially in tural areas</p>
<p>Newstart<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>project in ecery ptovinv</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>NOVA SCOTIA NEWSTART CORPORATION</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Robert Adams, an occupational analyst with the Training Branch of the Department of Labour (and later the Department of Manpower and Immigration) in Ottawa became Director of Occupational Training at Nova Scotia NewStart Corporation in Yarmouth, Nova Scotia.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In this capacity, he participated in NewStart meetings including the one in which the name was discussed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>On his return to Nova Scotia from the meeting which gave birth to DACUM, Adams set about making occupational analyses and presenting them in a single sheet format. The foundation of the DACUM approach developed by Adams and implemented at Nova Scotia NewStart was a single sheet task analysis of an occupation with the tasks being identified by people from the appropriate occupation or field.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Adams acted as a facilitator. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>WHAT IS DACUM ?</p>
<p>"DACUM can be defined as a single-sheet skill profile that serves as both a curriculum plan and an evaluation instrument for occupational training programs.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>It is graphic in nature, presenting definitions of the skills of an entire occupation on this single sheet of paper.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This discourages treatment of any element of the occupation in isolation.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Stated differently, it promotes treatment of any element as part of a larger whole.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>It is an analysis of an occupation rather than a curriculum evolving from an analysis. The occupation is sub-divided into General Areas of competence.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Each is then analyzed to identify each skill it contains.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The result is independent specification of each of the skills (behaviours) that collectively enable an individual to perform competently in the occupation.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>These skills are defined quite simply and are structured independently in small blocks on the chart.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Each can serve as an independent goal for learning achievement.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>He further identified the characteristics of DACUM as (Adams p. 259):</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>1.	Immediate feedback of results to the trainee.</p>
<p>2.	Immediate analysis of program strengths and weaknesses.</p>
<p>3.	Positive communication between instructor and trainee.</p>
<p>4.	Self-evaluation by the learner.</p>
<p>5.	Self-planning and goal setting.</p>
<p>6.	An interesting, efficient, and practical, yet unstructured learning environment.</p>
<p>7.	Onus for evaluation and qualification on the trainee.</p>
<p>8.	Positive relationship between training evaluation and the type of evaluation normally made by employers.</p>
<p>9.	Cumulative approach to achievement (the DACUM process will not allow negative or downward evaluation unless the trainee and instructor agree that a previous evaluation was in error.)<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>10.	An entry measure which takes into consideration the trainee's previous training and experience and allows him to proceed from his own appropriate point of departure.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>"The accurate preparation of a DACUM chart is the most important aspect of developing the program.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As with most programs utilizing behavioural objectives, the accurate specification of these objectives is critical." (Adams p. 43)</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The validity of the DACUM analysis process is based on the view that:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Χ	People who work in an occupation or field are best able to identify the skills performed in that field.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Χ	A committee of people from the occupation or field, with the aid of a trained facilitator, can identify most if not all of the required skills in a concentrated period of time.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The DACUM analysis differs from conventional approaches in a number of ways: (Adams pp. 43 - 44)</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>1.	Only observable behaviour is identified.</p>
<p>2.	Skills are stated within the context of the DACUM rating scale...</p>
<p>3.	The analysis is conducted by the industry or other eventual users of the training product, ...</p>
<p>4.	... skill definitions encompass more activity than the typical teacher-specified skill definitions.</p>
<p>5.	The analysis is conducted by means of a dynamic group activity.</p>
<p>6.	The analysis results in a format that is directly applicable as a curriculum.</p>
<p>CONCEPT</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The preparation of a DACUM chart involves bringing together 10 - 15 people from an occupation or field and, with the aid of a skilled coordinator, having them identify the skills practiced by people in that field.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As skills are identified, they are printed on cards which were fastened to a wall in horizontal rows.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In this way, an analysis emerges through the efforts and in front of the committee.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The use of cards makes it easy to add, change, remove or rearrange skills during the brainstorming process.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A chart presents the skills in the same words and format as<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>identified by the committee and posted on the wall but in a more manageable size.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>A DACUM chart is a presentation of an analysis.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It displays the tasks or skills of a field or occupation which have been identified during the analysis process.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is not a curriculum but a curriculum can be selected and developed from it.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>COMPONENTS</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>omponents of a DACUM chart</p>
<p>general areas of competence, s</p>
<p>kills or competencies,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>rating scale,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>and profiles.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span>General Areas of Competence</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>In addition to the above considerations for the committee as a whole, individual members should have the following qualifications: (ADAMS pp. 48 - 53)</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>	1.	Competence in the occupation</p>
<p>	2.	Full employment in the field</p>
<p>	3.	Considered by associates to be alert and forward thinking</p>
<p>	4.	Capable of verbalizing the needs and skills of his occupation.</p>
<p>	5.	Considered by associates to be capable of functioning as a member of a group.</p>
<p>	6.	Freedom from bias</p>
<p>	7.	Confidence</p>
<p>	8.	Freedom to devote full time for the required brainstorming session</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>BRAINSTORMING PROCESS</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>RATING SCALE</b><b></b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Another unique feature of DACUM is the seven-point performance-based rating scale which is printed on each DACUM chart.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The criteria and levels reflect those of the workplace.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Evaluation is of observable behaviour of the kind that an immediate supervisor would recognize in a work situation.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The evaluation process is simple, clear, easily understood by both employer and employee alike and is directly applicable to trainees preparing to work in an occupation or field.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Traditionally, school evaluation systems relate only to the acquisition of information in a school setting.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>DACUM evaluation is different; it is based in the reality of the real life work situation where application of knowledge, or performance, is the rule.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>DACUM RATING SCALE</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>A DACUM chart identifies competencies or skills and the rating scale includes criteria woven together into a scale which identifies recognizable levels of performance on any skill.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The rating scale is rooted in the reality of the workplace through the establishment of a benchmark - in this case, level 3, which denotes the performance level of a trained and experienced worker.</p>

<p><b>PROGRAM PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT</b><b></b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Successful individualized and competency based programs takes careful and extensive planning.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>DACUM is no exception.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A summary of the planning process follows.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The approach to program planning and development is described briefly, however, a detailed description of the planning process is included in Adams' report: (Adams pp. 34-37)</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>"To apply the DACUM system effectively, ensure that the Learning-Evaluation Model will work, and ensure that training system needs are met, it is necessary to establish new priorities for developing a program and preparing and organizing resources.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The Program Development Model (1) describes development categories that should be considered and the sequence in which they should be treated.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It should be noted that development occurs as a continuous recycling process and is designed to continue through the life of the program.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The Program Development Model is superimposed over the Learning-Evaluation Model which is shown in dotted lines. Connections are made with essential components of the Learning-Evaluation Model.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>1.	<span>Detect and Explore Need</span> - is the process of establishing need for a training program or for extensive modification of a program.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Assuming this results in a decision to use the DACUM process, the following must be identified: the employing community, the decision makers, potential instructor(s), potential resource persons for specific components of the program.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>2.	<span>Develop DACUM Chart</span> - is the process of committee specification of the skill requirements of the occupation.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>3.	<span>Select and Orient Instructor(s)</span> - can be finalized once the DACUM chart is prepared.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The Chart indicates the scope of skills that must be handled in the program, and from this the skill requirements of prospective instructors can be assessed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Introductory orientation should take place before placing heavy development responsibility on the instructor.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>However, it will continue informally well into the actual operation of the program.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>4.	<span>Define Learning Activities</span> - is the process of assessing each identified skill on the DACUM chart and visualizing appropriate work-oriented activities through which the student can gain experience and through which his achievement can be evaluated.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>5.	<span>Select and Place Trainee</span> - is done in two stages.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>First, the trainee is screened on the basis of his predicted ability to succeed in acquiring each of the skills on the chart, as opposed to assessing his ability on the basis of past learning performance.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Second, he can be placed directly in an on-the-job training environment if adequate resources are available or he can be detained until all the resources are available for an in-centre training program.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>6.	<span>Select Learning Environment</span> - involves assessment of each skill and its associated learning activities to determine availability of learning resources and realistic learning experiences in a number of environments.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It may be decided to locate training for the skill in a work environment because the experience will be more meaningful or the training less expensive.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>On the other hand, it may be safer and more convenient to locate training for the skill in a more controlled learning environment.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In most cases, it is found feasible to conduct part of the training for the skill in each environment.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>7.	<span>Select and Order Equipment, Tools, and Supplies</span> - involves the selection of occupational tools, equipment, supplies, parts, etc.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>These may be available in an on-job-training site but must be obtained for a centralized training program.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>8.	<span>Install Equipment, Tools and Supplies</span> - is the process of organizing or modifying the selected learning environment(s) in preparation for the trainee's first task-oriented experience, ensuring that all resources are organized for his convenience.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>9.	<span>Locate and Assign Human Resources</span> - is the process of ensuring that all components or skills of the chart are adequately covered by available human resources.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This involves assignment of instructors to skills and arrangements to bring in resource persons to handle any skills that cannot be handled by the instructional team.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>10.	<span>Organize Individual Learning Activity Batteries</span> - involves two steps.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>First, an individual package or container is prepared for learning materials for each skill on the DACUM chart.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Second, an assessment is made of each skill and its associated learning activities to determine what supporting knowledge will likely be required.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>11.	<span>Select Printed Materials</span> - is the first step normally taken in developing a Learning Activity Battery.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Materials are selected on the basis of their projected value in terms of facilitating learning.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>No materials are included which are not directly related to the skill identified.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>12.	<span>Develop Printed Materials</span> - is the process of developing printed materials to supplement those that are already available.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>13.	<span>Select AV Materials</span> - involves two separate assessments of requirement.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>One, there may be a need to have visual materials available for those learners who</p>
<p>Figure 6</p>
<p>may have reading deficits or may not be attracted to reading as a method of acquiring information.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Two, specific skills that require extensive procedures, intricate motions, or the acquisition of complex concepts may best be learned from audio-visual materials.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The materials in this category are usually commercially available.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>14.	<span>Develop Audio-Visual Materials</span> - is the development of materials by instructional staff.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>These may be videotaped demonstrations and presentations, tape-slide presentations, or audio tapes accompanied by textbooks or other printed materials.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>15.	<span>Select and install Learning Equipment</span> - involves analysis of Learning Activity Battery resources to determine what equipment and furniture are required and installing this.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The preceding activities are all part of establishing the initial program.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The following activities take place after the first trainees have had an opportunity to cycle through the steps in the Learning-Evaluation Model.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>16.	<span>Assess Lack of Achievement</span> - is the obvious starting point in refining the learning program.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Lack of achievement might be attributed to:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>		(a)	Lack of motivation or specific learning difficulties on the part of individual trainees.</p>
<p>	(b)	Ineffectiveness of resources.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>17.	<span>Evaluate Resources and Materials</span> - will result where lack of achievement is attributed to ineffectiveness of resources.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Resources might be ineffective for a number of reasons:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>(a)	Learning activities may be inappropriate or inefficient.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>		(b)	The learning environment may not be adequate.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>		(c)	Necessary equipment or supplies may not have been made available or may not be appropriately located to facilitate task achievement.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>		(d)	Materials in a Learning Activity Battery may be inadequate or insufficient .<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This will be indicated by learner difficulty or frustration while working with materials.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Materials may need to be added, or removed because they are confusing or inappropriate.</p>
