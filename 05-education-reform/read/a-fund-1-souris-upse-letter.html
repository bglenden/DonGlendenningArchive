<p>Karen Jackson, President</p>
<p>PEI<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Union of Public Sector Employees:</p>

<p>Dear Ms. Jackson:</p>
<p>Supporting Innovation in Souris</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>First let me commend you for your “UPSE Has a Heart” initiative, I never really doubted it but it is great to see it reaffirmed.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Education 20/20 Inc.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>is an independent, broad based not-for-profit education group<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>that was incorporated in 2012 and received a charitable number in 2015 (822339-4).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is headquartered in Charlottetown and is governed by a volunteer board. Activities include an annual education award, a monthly bilingual newsletter, workshops and public presentations, research and occasional papers and a variety low-key consultations with various individuals and organizations.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>More detailed information may be found in the enclosed literature.</p>
<p>Innovation is needed everywhere and can start anywhere.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Quite by accident we became aware of the Souris Garden club, a largely volunteer initiative to introduce young people into gardening, food production and environmental matters. Since then, we’ve become involved in other educational issues especially issues around the transition of young people from school to work.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Offering financial support for innovative educational initiatives is simply another component.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>This letter is an invitation to the Union of Public Sector Employees to be the lead donor with a $1,500 grant to fund an innovative educational initiative in Souris; in return, Education 20/20 will raise a matching amount .<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>With funds in hand, Education will then call for proposals as per the attached description.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Should our fundraising exceed the matching amount, we will apply the surplus to a similar initiative in 2019.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Education 20/20 will not claim your contribution until we have a matching amount in our account.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>By joining forces, we can double the likelihood that innovation will find take in Souris</p>
<p>We thank you in advance for your consideration and, should this application be successful, will give appropriate public recognition to the Union of Public Service Employees for your role in making it happen.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Don Glendenning</p>
<p>President</p>
