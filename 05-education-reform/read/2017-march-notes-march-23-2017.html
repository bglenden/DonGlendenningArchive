  2017 March Notes March 23, 2017
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Don Glendenning convenes initial discussions about the perceived gap between student skills at graduation and those needed for post-secondary education and employment. He frames the issue using Council of Ministers of Education Canada (CMEC) terminology as a &quot;transition&quot; problem rooted partly in communication failures. Drawing on conversations with students, parents, employers, and grandparents, Don proposes exploring a curriculum map or master list of competencies across institutions. He invites stakeholders to a 90-minute working meeting on April 6, 2017, at Royalty Centre to explore systemic solutions. The document reflects Don&#x27;s systematic, collaborative approach to identifying education system gaps.</div>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 108%">Unfortunately the
weatherman was not on our mailing list for the meeting of February 8
and he/she used that day as a storm day. Hopefully April 6 will be
better.  
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 108%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 108%">As I said in my
earlier invitation, I’ve spoken with most, if not all, about a
perceived gap between the skills students have and the skills needed
for entrance into postsecondary education and employment.  I also
talked with students, parents, grandparents and employers. In the
meantime, the Council of Ministers of Education Canada (CMEC)
addressed the same issue and, in their media release of July 8,
(Attached) referred to the issue as one of transition; I’m adopting
their term.  A copy of their press release is attached.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 108%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 108%">My conversations and
reading suggest that problems in transition, at least in part, may be
a matter of communication.  In re-reading the “Youth Pathways
Report” of 2011, I was interested to note that Dr. Tilleczek drew
the same conclusion; while we may want to talk about a number of
matters, I’d like to explore the idea of a curriculum map or master
list of skills, competencies or outcomes from which institutions
select the the outcomes their students are expected to learn under
their care  or expected to hve mastered prior to acceptance into a
program.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 108%"> 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 108%">Consequently, I’m
inviting you to meet on Thursday, April 6, 2017 at 9:00 am in room
149 at Royalty Centre to explore this issue; I know that you are all
busy so I’ve placed a 90 minute limit on the length of the meeting.

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 108%">See you on March 23</p>
