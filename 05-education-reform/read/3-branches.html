  3 Branches 
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">A letter proposing that PEI restructure education services along branches or types rather than age-levels. Don notes that most government departments organize by field (Health: services, drugs, COVID, e-health; Agriculture: crops, livestock, land). He observes that Education is organized by level/age instead, and that while Early Childhood Development and student assessment are identified as services, most departmental focus centers on school operation. Don emphasizes that Islander conversations repeatedly highlight essential skills, personal skills, and employment, yet these are not prominent departmental services. He calls for discussion and restructuring to elevate literacy, numeracy, and employment training to parity with Early Childhood Development.</div>

<div class="reader-content">
<p><b>Dear Editor:</b></p>
<p><b>Branches of Education</b></p>
<p>I think our Government should review the way it structures education services. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Normally Governments structure their Departments around kinds, types, functions or branches of a sector.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In health, for example, we find health services, drugs, covid and E-health: in support of agriculture we find crops, livestock, land, agribusiness, policy and supports. Services are not mentioned in Education except for Early Childhood Dvelopment and student assessment, Oher activities seem to focus on the running of schools. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Most conversations that I have with Islander includes mention of essential kills, personal skills and employment.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I am surprised that these are not included as services and appear higher in the chain of command. To be even more specific, Given the recent press coverage of literacy and numeracy, I am surprised they are not given equal billing with Early Childhood Development.</p>
<p>Some discussion and restructuring seems in order.</p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
<p>Don Glendenning</p>
