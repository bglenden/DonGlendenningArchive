  55 D 002 Teaching and sorting-2
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Extended exploration of incompatible roles in schools: education vs. training, general vs. vocational, credentials vs. qualifications. Core argument: schools have dual conflicting mandates—teaching/learning and sorting/ranking students. Distinguishes: learning (behavioral change), education (sum of formative experiences), schooling (government-funded formal instruction), credentials (what was taught), and qualifications (what one can do). Proposes independent qualification body separate from schools. Concludes schooling/credentialing and teaching are fundamentally incompatible roles; recommends schools focus on learning, external bodies handle certification. Extensively documented draft with multiple revisions showing refinement of ideas.

	<b>Incompatible Conflicting RolesViews</b></p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in"><span lang="en-US">As long as I can
	remember there has been a debate about the role of schools with a
	fairly sharp distinction being made between education and training
	or vocational and general education.  To the old issues we can add
	education versus schooling, and even more recently about credentials
	and qualifications. Here’s my version.</span></p>
	<ul>
		<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><span lang="en-US">First we have
		learning; that’s when we engage in activities that change our
		behaviour; changes occur in in one or more of our attitudes, skills
		or knowledge; </span>
		</p></li>
		<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><span lang="en-US">Our education
		is the result of the result of experiences that have made  an
		impact on us, however, because not two people have exactly the same
		genes or the same previous learning experiences, no two people have
		the same education. </span>
		</p></li>
		<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in"><span lang="en-US">The process
		of learning can benefit from the help of others in the form
		information, instruction, counsel, encouragement, feedback,
		resource material etc.  Help comes from many sources especially the
		home, the community, one’s personal endeavours and of course
		schools.</span></p></li>
		<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in"><span lang="en-US">Schools
		provide important support for learning, for ones education, but it
		is only a part.  Schools help learners learn what governments
		believe to be important and what governments are prepared to pay
		for.</span></p></li>
		<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in"><span lang="en-US">Educators
		have a habit of classifying the content to be learned as being
		general or vocational; many also believe that the general, as they
		have defined it, is more valuable than the vocational.  But they
		are wrong; the content is neutral; whether it becomes general or
		vocational depends upon the objective of the learner and the
		standards to be met.</span></p></li>
		<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in"><span lang="en-US">The study
		of any subject can take one to higher and higher levels</span></p></li>
		<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in"><span lang="en-US">The role of
		educators is to design learning activities that will help learners
		learn in new fields or reach a level  higher levels than they are
		at at present.</span></p></li>
	</ul>
	<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
	Now
	comes the tricky part:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
		Schools
		group students by age levels, set aside i92 days of instruction
		each year and help students learn as much as they can within those
		parameters</p></li>
		<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Society
		has asked and schools have complied with the request, that teachers
		not only teach but that they also sort, a kind of triage.  
		</p></li>
		<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">A
		study would likely reveal that there is insufficient change in
		students’ standing from year to year to warrant the cost of
		sotrtin, however the practice continues</p></li>
		<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">This
		approach to sorting is inconsistent with the practice in other
		professions and places teachers in a conflict of role.  Sports
		activities have coaches and referees, legal matters are dealt with
		by lawyers and judges, finance has accountants and auditors.</p></li>
		<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">But
		even more important, feedback to students, parents and the public
		at large concentrates on the pecking order rather than learning.</p></li>
		<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><a name="_GoBack"></a>
		The
		process is further complicated by the fact that the publicity
		around credentials, what the teachers have taught, overshadows the
		interest of the public in what has been learned.</p></li>
		<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">seems
		to want to know what students hatudents seem to want, A
		qualification, on the other hand, speaks to the issue of attitudes,
		skills and knowledge required to successfully perform in a role or
		at a task.  Employment advertisements often identify both a
		credential, such as a high school diploma, and a set of
		qualifications such as a journeyman or professional
		certificationusually including training and or experience.  In
		order to teach, one also needs a credential, a university degree,
		and a qualification, a teaching licence, the latter attesting to
		one’s ability to teach.</p></li>

	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in"><span lang="en-US">But, in the
	public mind, there is confusion as to the meaning, or more
	accurately, the difference between a credential  and a
	qualification; the two are often thought to be the same.</span></p>
	<ul>
		<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in"><span lang="en-US">We add to

	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in"> <span lang="en-US">All these
	things brings to the fore an as yet unresolved conflict within the
	system.  Are schools, colleges and universities institutions of
	learning and learning or are they also, some might say primarily
	institutions for sorting.   Resolving this conflict will, I believe,
	go a long way towards helping us provide a quality education for
	every Canadian.</span></p>

	continued to offer subject centred instruction, need for formal
