  D Roundtable A  
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Don writes to Metro Credit Union&#x27;s Bernard Gillis requesting three-year financial support for Education 20/20 Inc.&#x27;s roundtable initiative. He identifies structural impediments to educational change (unclear mandates, outdated philosophy, vague goals, teaching-delivery rather than learner-development models, unanchored standards). Don proposes roundtable sessions—invitational discussions with diverse stakeholders, recommended readings, guided questions, and independent chairs—to examine current issues including attendance, mission statements, governance, early childhood education, standards, and social promotion. He emphasizes that educators themselves hesitate to speak publicly on education matters and that media capability is limited. The initiative seeks to fill information gaps and enable community engagement in educational reform.</div>

<p>Dear Mr. Gillis:		</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Please consider this letter a request for financial support for Education 20/20 Inc., a national, not-for-profit education organization, located in Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island. Since we last spoke, Education 20/20 Inc. has continued its work in support of change, especially change in public education. It is our view that much remains to be done.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Our objective is to ensure a quality education for every Canadian; that means bringing about change in a long established organization, not an easy task<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>when one is outside the organization you want to change.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Based on our review to date, we are of the view that most of the initial impediments to change in public education are structural or organizational in nature<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>such as mandates not clearly stated, a philosophy statement dated 1990, <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>goals and outcomes too vague for meaning and measurement, a teaching model that delivers instruction rather than supporting development, unanchored standards, and a system is kept alive it seems by politicians, senior bureaucrats and the teachers’ unions. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>One of the keys to change is independent and relevant Information and active engagement of educators with the community they serve.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>At the moment we are filling the gap by publishing a monthly bilingual newsletter, hosting a website, convening<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>meetings with a variety of individuals and organizations, including the Minister of Education<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>and the English Language School Board, organizing occasional workshops and public presentations.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We have also published a seven-point Call<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>for Action which I am attaching for your information.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>While these have been useful, we plan to expand in this area and tofocus<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Educators themselves are not salesmen for their profession;<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>tend to be “silo” based especially when it comes to professional matters.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A scan of recent PEI Education Commission reports funded by the Departmment in recent years reveal few, if any members from the community at large, curriculum committee members seldom come from<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>the communty being served, public comment about issues usually is limited to the Minister, senior officials or representatives from the PEITF There is a<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>reluctance, some would say fear, among educators generally about speaking publicly on matters of education.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Of course our media have limitedlimited capability This needs to change</p>
<p>In response, we propose to add a series of round tables sessions devoted to the examination of current issues.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Round tables will be invitational, include a spectrum of participants, include<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>recommended reading and a series of questions and probably meet for<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>a morning or an afternoon with<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>an independent chair.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Issues are yet to be decided but will likely include issues currently on the table including attendance, updating the mission statement, governance, Early Choldhood Education, standards and social promotion, <span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Our group cannot make this happen alone; we need your help – both encouragement and financial support and preferably over a three year period.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I would welcome an opportunity to meet, to provide more details about our plans. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I’ll be in touch within the next few days seeking an appointment.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
