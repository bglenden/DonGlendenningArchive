  Assessment
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Don&#x27;s detailed educational philosophy on assessment, drawing on Wolff&#x27;s framework distinguishing formative assessment (feedback), summative evaluation (achievement levels), and ranking (comparative measurement). Argues assessment and grading serve different functions and should be separated, with ranking not constituting an education function but rather quality assurance.</div>

	<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
	According to Robert Paul Wolff (A
	Discourse on Grading, 1969) there are three elements of student
	grading:</p>
	<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
	•	Criticism or formative assessment,
	sometimes called analyses and feedback, is at the heart of teaching
	and learning and involves the give and take between teacher and
	learner about what happened or should happen during the learning
	process; assessment focuses on learning, teaching, outcomes,
	competencies, skills or even the acquisition of knowledge. This kind
	of assessment provides information for improving learning and
	teaching and is an interactive process between student and teacher
	designed to inform both learner and teacher how well their students
	are learning what teachers are teaching. The information is used by
	teachers to make changes in what will be taught next and when,
	where, how and even why.  It is considered feedback to students,
	shared fully and probably confidentially, unique to each learner,
	course or incident based and sometimes anonymous and not connected
	to passing or grading.</p>
	<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
	•	Evaluation or summative assessment
	is used to establish a person’s level of achievement or
	performance in a subject or field.  Evaluation is criterion
	referenced, focused on establishing a level of achievement and may
	take into account more than course content and academic success
	depending on its purpose including discussion, cooperation,
	attendance, presentation, etc.  Judgement?</p>
	<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
	•	Ranking involves measuring how one
	person stacks up against others of the same age, number of years of
	study, in other countries; ranking serves a number of functions in
	an educational system including accountability, gate-keeping,
	instructional diagnosis and monitoring of student achievement.</p>
	<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
	<br />
<br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
	Formative testing is obviously part of
	the teaching function and ranking is part of quality assurance
	function, but the who, what and where of summative testing is not so
	clear, at least not in the view of the writer. 
	</p>
	<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
	There is no agreement as to what
	constitutes a level of achievement and how to measure it although
	seat time is the most common proxy,   In recent discussions with a
	range of math education providers however, there seemed to be some
	agreement that math performance levels rests on three factors,
	number of skills and outcomes demonstrated, levels of performance on
	each and extent and nature and extent to which they are clustered in
	that learner’s repertoire.  
	</p>
	<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
	<br />
<br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
	The role of a teacher is to teach, to
	help students learn new skills and to increase levels of performance
	in existing skills, to gain new knowledge or change attitudes.  As
	part of the instructional process, teachers gather information from
	all sources and, based on the findings, design new strategies to
	help learners with their learning.</p>
	<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">

<br />

	</p>
	<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
	 It can be argued that that assessing
	students for the purpose of assigning levels of proficiency and
	ranking are not teaching functions, in fact, may not even be an
	education function, and represent a conflict of interest between
	teacher and student.  For these reasons, most sectors and many
	educational organizations separate the teaching and the grading
	functions; apprenticeship, International baccalaureate program,
	qualification authorities, music and other are examples of the
	latter approach.</p>

	The logic of using the same terminology
	to label both administrative and grading purposes escapes me; I’m
	sure that it must puzzle students and parents as well.  The two
	should be separate.  Have 12 levels of s subject if you must,
	although that seems excessive, but refer to them as levels not
	grades; only use Grade for administrative groupings – “My
	daughter is taking Level 9 Math”.</p>

	Testing, standards, passing, assessment,
