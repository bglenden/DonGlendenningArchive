<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><b>BACKGROUND</b></p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><br />

</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in">Our future as
individuals and as communities depends to a large degree on the
quality of our education.  Gaining a quality education, therefore,
should be a major focus of every citizen, providing a quality
education should be the focus of governments, and providing a quality
education the objective of every teacher and school.  An award is for
having done something done rather than a grant to do something.

Thanks to the generosity of an Island family, Education 20/20 Inc.
has established an awards program as a mechanism to call attention by
the public to important characteristics of effective schools and to
provide some financial support to schools for their efforts to
implement them.  The focus of the award is on engagement in the daily
operation of the school and on those items over which the school has
substantial control</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><br />

</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"> including
communication with family, the school culture,
interaction with the community, frequency of community based events
and parent/community involvement in curriculum development and
planning.

</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><b>ENGAGEMENT</b></p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">The National Parent
Teacher Association in the USApoints out that “when families,
schools, and communities work together student achievement improves,
teacher morale rises and communication increases”

	collaborative projects, i.e. learning to work and solve real
	problems in groups, by sharpening their own understand through
	listening seriously to insights of others especially those from
