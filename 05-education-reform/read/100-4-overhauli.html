  100 -4 OverhaulI
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Editor letter noting weekly emerging education issues (Ontario teacher math testing, Alberta curriculum overhaul, Manitoba nursing math skills, grade inflation, worker shortages, university costs, poverty&#x27;s impact on performance). Describes growing gap between desired and provided education services, with conversation focused on administrative matters rather than substantive learning outcomes. Argues system structure—embedding education in government—prevents necessary direction, freedom, and support. Calls for public conversation, simple plan with definitions, guiding principles, service descriptions, governance clarity, and locally-led (not expert-driven) development.</div>

<p><b>Editor-104<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b>Education Needs an Overhaul</b></p>
<p>It seems that most weeks produce a new set of educational issues – math tests for teachers in Ontario, curriculum overhaul in Alberta, math levels of nurses in Manitoba, grade inflation, shortage of construction workers in PEI, high cost of university study, impact of poverty on student performance, and the list goes on.</p>
<p>There appears to be a growing gap between education services needed and education services provided.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We want our students to be literate and numerate, to become independent learners, to take care of themselves and work and play together. Education’s business is to help Islanders gain new and better skills, knowledge, attitudes and values.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We wonder if<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>our students would benefit from holistic rating scales, competency based learning, self- paced programs and schools operating on democratic principles.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>W know that money is needed for buses. buildings, salaries and technology but tell is how spending<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>those dollars improves their education.The conversation is bogged down on matters of administrivia (school upgrading, credits, grades, noon meals, technology, etc.) at the expense of changes that<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>help Islanders gain knowledge, skills, attitudes and values needed to help them to thrive in later life. In saying this, I do not, we cannot, blame the current government, the previous government or any single government that went before. It is the writer’s view that much of the needed change is blocked by an outdated<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>system; we’ve embedded education in a body that can give it neither direction, freedom nor support needed to accomplish the task at hand.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Government not only needs to change a number of existing policies and practices but also needs to allow, nay encourage,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>change to happen. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>It’s<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>time for a public conversation about education on PEI. then we need a plan.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>PEI has 150,000 citizens; all are potential users of educational services. Their need s, interests and capabilities are many and varied, but policy documents are focused on providing services to young people through schools. It’s as though the only education that counts is the part provided by teachers in schools.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Education needs a plan, something simple, some definitions, a few guiding principles, description of services, who will do what and what services will government pay for, access routes, sources of information and help. Such a statement should be short, sharp and developed with public input – but not by outside experts.</p>
<p>Islanders deserve “better” education service, but better doesn’t appear on the agenda – at least not yet.</p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
