  D-1 Whither bound
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">A letter to editors (Charlottetown Guardian, Journal Pioneer) prompted by a 1950s memory of a booklet titled &quot;Whither Bound?&quot; in a landlady&#x27;s home at an American university. Don questions PEI&#x27;s educational direction, noting the $600 million government investment lacks clear purpose. He advocates for the state to clarify why it educates citizens, how it should do so, and who determines when someone is educated. He emphasizes learning as behavioral change distinct from school attendance and calls for public conversation on education.</div>

<p>:</p>
<p>Whither Bound?</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>In the mid=1950’s, I spent a year at an American University.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I lived off campus in The basement of a private home and had cooking privilege in the regular kitchen.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My landlady was legally blind but also deeply religious.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>On my bedside table she had placed a little booklet with the title “Whither Bound”.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I think of these words often these days as I reflect on the future of Education; I do so because PEI educational plans<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>are just not clear.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>PEI is home to 155,000 people; all should be encouraged to learn.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>By ”learn” I mean add to or further develop their knowledge, skill or attitudes base.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They may do it on their own or need help. The helper is usually referred to as a teacher and the person being helped is known as a teacher. Of all a person’s teachers, the home is most important.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A person’s education is the result of all our experiences in life.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Parents and communities generally think learning to be important and authorize government to arrange learning experiences. Government responded by setting up special places called schools where teachers and students meet and work together of a kind in in a manner set out by government.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Because having an education is so important, governments also require people to attend school until they are 18 years of age. The problem that arises, however, is that people learn at different rates In fact being in school for 12 years is not a very reliable measure of how much a person has learned. A second problem, as identified by the World Bank, is he confusion that arises from people, parents and educators alike, in thinking that going to school and getting an education are one and the same.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I am told that the government of Prince Edward Island invests some 600 million dollars in educational services; the purpose is not clear.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Is it to help people what’s missing is a set of expectations in return for that investment. The literature suggests a number of possibilities (1) thrive as citizens in a democracy, (2) entry level employment<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>supply services needed to maintain PEI as a place we want to live – and I am sure there are others.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Learning is best when it is in a context; that is the rationale for project based learning work placements and community service components of school programs’<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My reading reveals</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Countries deal with this issue in a variety of ways – external exams and competency based reporting but neither appear to be in use in PEI at the moment..</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>We know thatpeople learn at different ratesOne of the problems that emerges with this arrangement is that many people confuse “going to school with getting an educationmeet; they also require students to attend. Because of the umbers involved, government usually it important , especially young people, to have a broad base of learning expriences especially at an early age so they empower governments to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I say this because the Department of Education gives its role as one of “developing and delivering” high quality programs to Island children. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That seems narrow in comparison to the mandate of the Department of Health whose role is tp provide “accessible quality health services throughout the Island” or the Ministry of Agriculture with a goal of “leading our Province in efforts to innovate our agriculture and agri-food sector .<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Education needs and deserves an equivalent role.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Seems to me that PEI should encourage all Islanders to continue their education;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>some may have their education paid for; others may not.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In that vein, since literacy or communication is so key to our futures, Government should consider covering part or all the cost of literacy for Islanders of any age.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
