  D1 Early Education
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Don responds to Nicholas Kristof&#x27;s New York Times essay about early childhood education reducing community inequality. Don concurs that early childhood education and reading are education&#x27;s highest-priority areas but disagrees with organizational approach. He argues PEI correctly recognizes postsecondary/adult education&#x27;s distinct needs (separate department) and similarly should create specialized early childhood services. Don proposes: early childhood deserves equal consideration with distinct development focus rather than school-preparation focus; early childhood specialists should conduct home visits; school-based early education wrongly models itself on hospital-based pediatrics; early childhood providers need freedom unavailable to traditional teachers. Don emphasizes education is lifelong beginning at birth, making early years most critical, yet questions why this receives minimal attention despite research consensus. This letter shows Don&#x27;s sophisticated understanding of lifecycle education and organizational design principles.</div>

<p>Editor<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p>Charlottetown, PEI</p>
<p>Dear Sir:</p>
<p><b>Early Education</b></p>
<p>I’ve intended for some time to write a letter to the Editor about early childhood education; what spurred me to do it now was an opinion piece by Nicholas Kristof in the New York Times on October 20, 2011.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Kristof believes that the expansion of early childhood education, by itself would go a long way to reducing inequalities in our communities.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I agree.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Early childhood education and reading are probably the two subjects that arise most often in my discussions about education.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Where I differ from many educators is about the way early childhood education should be organized.</p>
<p>While I believe that more support should be given to early childhood education, I also believe:</p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li1">PEI has a Department of Education, however, it recognizes that postsecondary and adult education serves a different population and placed the responsibility for that component in the Department of Technology and Postsecondary Education</li>
  <li class="li1">Our youngest learners also deserve equal consideration and special programs designed to serve their needs with an emphasis on development and not on schooling.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This approach may be likened to having juvenile courts as part of the justice system or pediatrics in the health field.</li>
  <li class="li1">Support should begin through home visits by an early childhood specialist.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></li>
  <li class="li1">Making a school the provider of home based early education would be similar to offering all paediatric care through hospitals.</li>
  <li class="li1">The providers of early childhood education need a freedom to act that is currently not available to teachers generally.</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li1">hile Most parents will be familiar with the question “Are we there yet?; the answer was often “Not yet”.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If asked the same question about early childhood education, I would give the same answer, “Not yet.” <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>So, how do we get there?</li>
</ul>
<p>Let me say right up front, that I don’t have the answer either but I know some people who can help.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>by both cases when Education begins at birth and is life long with the preschool years being the most important.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>One wonders<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>why, therefore, that early childhood development is so neglected</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The early years are very important and deserve more attention</p>
<p>But school is not the answer</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Among the many courses constituting my formal schooling, and all taken in an earlier millennium.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>One course that stands<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I am sure that there are better descriptions and would welcome yours at standards2020@gmail.com<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
