<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li3"><b>Reading Program</b></li>
</ul>
<p>The Learning Disabilities Association of PEI offers a reading program at 11 locations throughout PEI; the program currently serves 61 students with all but 1 being aged 18 or under.

<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li3"><b>Community Youth Justice Camp</b></li>
</ul>
<p>The community Legal Information Association provides people with “understandable, useful and free information about our laws and justice system.” Their proposal is to offer a Community Youth Justice Camp to help our youth to understand how our justice system works, the three-day Camp for youth from ages 13 to 15 and will include gust speakers, visit to aa police station, a mock trial at a courthouse, conflict resolution, and leadership skills.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>will include youth as guest speakers, of three days’ duration<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li3"><b> Math Magic</b></li>
</ul>
<p>coSolved Consulting is working with the School of Mathematical Science at UPEI and the Department of Education to help people rid themselves of some of their “fears, anxieties and stereotypes about math and mathematicians”. The events are intended to change the image of math in the minds of young people.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Events will showcase some of the wonders of<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>mathematics outside the school curriculum through comedy, mathematical magic, applied geometry and physics, fun math facts, and some awe-inspiring real examples of math in action.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The presentation will revolve around basket balls, Rubik”s Cube, a mobius strip and knot theorists untangling DNA.” These will be audience participation events; the first “Math magic’ event will be held at the Confederation Centre Public Library in Charlottetown; the second event will be held at the Summerside Library during “global math week” (October 10-17, 2017)<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>While all proposals were considered worthy, the Committee favoured the “math magic” for<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>the Education Award proposal because of its fresh approach to break down stereotypes, the engagement of the education sector, the linkage with other math initiatives in which Education 20/20 9s involved <b><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span></b>and the range and numbers of people to be served.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></p>
