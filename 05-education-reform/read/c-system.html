  C System
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">A substantial working paper comparing school systems with education systems and arguing PEI operates the former, not the latter. Don establishes that education&#x27;s future impact depends on citizen education quality, that education is an umbrella concept encompassing all impact-bearing experiences, and that early home/family experiences plus teacher influence are key. He notes education is constitutionally provincial responsibility but provinces should &quot;promote, support and regulate&quot; services—yet services are rarely identified separately or promoted, remaining embedded in schools/colleges/universities for enrolled students, creating a fragmented system. The paper includes British Columbia&#x27;s education development goals (critical thinking, creativity, independence, skill, productivity, cooperation, civic awareness), defines education systems through multiple sources (Business Roundtable standards, components, Georgia Vision Project elements), and catalogs comprehensive services. Don identifies accountability types (compliance, professional norms, results), observes PEI lacks clear role descriptions for teachers/principals and performance reports, and recommends readings (OECD Education 2030, PISA, World Bank Education Crisis 2019, CMEC PCAP 2019). This paper represents Don&#x27;s most comprehensive systematic analysis.</div>

Education is an umbrella concept and includes all experiences that

experiences occur and however they are triggered. The key to a
person’s education, the literature tells us, are early experiences
triggered in and through the home and family, followed by the
influence of teachers</b></p>

<b>According to Anderson (See below) there are
three main types of accountability – compliance, adherence to
professional norms and results. Organizational accountability is
about defining an organization’s mission, values and goals as well
as everyone’s role in working towards them; holding yourself, and
everyone else, responsible for accomplishing goals, completing
assignments and making decisions that deliver on expectations; people
resist and fail to support what they don’t understand; culture of
accountability. Start with clarity and set expectations; be goal
focused, hire the right people, Communicate with transparency. team

organization perform. </b>
