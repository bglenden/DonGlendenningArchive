<div class="reader-summary">A letter to the Editor of the Guardian (dated February 1, 2013) titled &quot;MOOCs in Education.&quot; Don expresses concern about the &quot;tsunami&quot; of online education, drawing parallels to Japan&#x27;s actual tsunami. He distinguishes between technical knowledge (printable, lectureable, rote) and practical knowledge (wisdom, judgment, skill) that cannot be taught through online formats alone. Quoting David Brooks and Sheryl Sandberg, Don advocates for in-person instruction in critical thinking, communication, and practical skills. He criticizes low public expectations for communication skills, particularly in reading and writing, and challenges citizens to demand accountability from educators. A passionate and prescient argument against viewing education as purely technical delivery.</div>

<p><br></p>
<p>Dear Sir:</p>
<p><b>MOOCs in Education</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>Thank goodness, PEI was a long way from the epicenter of the recent tsunami that devastated Japan, we may not be so lucky with the tsunami unleashed by forays into education, or at least into that part of education delivering courses to students. <span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></p>

<p>New York Times, April 5, 2013, The Practical University by David Brooks –<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Universities are more than sorting devices</p>
<p>Place where young people aquire two sorts of knowledge -<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>technical knowledge and practical knowledge.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Technical knowledge – the kind of knowledge that can be printed in a book, , captured in lectures, formulas, bullet points and rote memory.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Much of this can be handled on-line ; are good, will become better and more interactive with better assessments</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Practical knowledge - Practical knowledge is not about what you do, but how you do it. It is the wisdom a great chef possesses that cannot be found in recipe books. Practical knowledge is not the sort of knowledge that can be taught and memorized; it can only be imparted and absorbed. It is not reducible to rules; it only exists in practice. Think about Sheryl Sandberg’s recent book, “Lean In.” Put aside the debate about the challenges facing women in society. Focus on the tasks she describes as being important for anybody who wants to rise in this economy: the ability to be assertive in a meeting; to disagree pleasantly; to know when to interrupt and when not to; to understand the flow of discussion and how to change people’s minds; to attract mentors; to understand situations; to discern what can change and what can’t.</p>

<p>Laura Secord and Paul Revere had something in common, theMy wife and I were out for dinner recently; one meal was excellent and one was not up to our expectations.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Next time out, what are our choices?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Do we choose a different restaurant or the same menu but another menu item?</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>People, especially but not only employers, tell me that reading and writing skills of graduates are not up to expectations.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>What are their choices?</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I had coffee and conversation recently with an old friend and former colleague; not surprising, the conversation turned to education in general, but the importance of communication skills in particular.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I posed a question as to why the public at large, and employers in particular, were not more vocal about the level of reading and writing of graduates. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The public, including employers, he said, have low expectations and a high tolerance for<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>a low level of communication skills.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Although I had not had it put that way before, the view is consistent with<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>other comments I’ve heard.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>What are their choices?</p>
<p>First, and most obvious, is to let supplier, the school, know that you are not satisfied with current service.</p>
<p>Public education is a monopoly and the menu at every school is essentially the same; selecting from another school will likely not make a difference.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The supplier, the school, will not feel any impact even if you use the services of a competitor, a private school.</p>
<p>Speak to a Director or the Chairman of the board, by this I mean the Premier and members of the cabinet.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We’ve given them a contract to run a school system.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If we are not happy with the service we should tell them so. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>More precise description of desireable qualifications, or competerncies may help but, at the end of the day, local employers have very few options.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>While it may be the result of unclear hiring specUnfortunately,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The cause is important, a review is timely, and there is considerable support for change from both within the system and the community at large. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It’s time to think outside the box.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Feel free to write me at<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>HYPERLINK "mailto:standards2020@gmail.com" <span>standards2020@gmail.com</span>.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
