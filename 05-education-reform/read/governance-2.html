<div class="reader-summary">A critical response to PEI&#x27;s education governance study, arguing that governance cannot be reformed without first establishing clear educational philosophy and that the focus should be on improving education broadly, not just structural reorganization. Don advocates for continuous institutional change management, expanded parent and citizen engagement, increased teacher autonomy, and references Alberta&#x27;s competitive education model demonstrating how market forces drive performance improvement and innovation in schools.</div>

on School Governance</span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in"><b>Background</b></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in"><i>Changes in education are needed. 
Change is not something to be undertaken every few years; in the
words of local business leader, the ability to manage change is one
of the important skills of modern society.   Most businesses have had
to reinvent themselves, sometimes more than once, yet schools
continue with a bit of tinkering and fine tuning.</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">The system of delivery for
educational services has remained virtually unchanged for decades. 
Yes, schools have grown in size, new subjects have been added, small
schools have disappeared, But the concept of placing learners in the
care of schools lfor several hours each day has not changed – at
least for the better.  We’be failed to talke advantage of advances
in technology and new approaches to teacvhing and it is unlikely,
therefore, that the changes that are needed will be generated by
people now in the system.  While I welcomed the Minister’s
announcement of aneducation study, in my view, it had two strikes
against it from day one.  Governance was too narrow a focus to deal
with the concerns being expressed to me and the leadership of the
study was internal.  Again, in my view, the focus should have been on
improving education; commissioner would soon have found that the
governance structure was one of the problems but certainly not the
only one.  It appears that the Commissioners arrived at the same
conclusion because their very first recommendation is that the
Minister review “…the philosophy of education”.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">In the same vein, I also agree with
the recommendation for increased parent participation in education
matters, but it should be broadened to include engagement of citizens
generally, not just parents.  After all, schools help people prepare
for their various life roles; where better to look for help than the
people who fill those roles.   That having been said, I am equally
supportive of the view that any changes to the system should include
both greater freedom and accountability for teachers.  Engagement is
more than a token citizen on selected committees; messy and all as it
is, engagement is democracy in action.it</p>

<b>Alberta's
education system offers lesson in competition </b>

<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
Alberta
public schools (and it pains this Calgarian to say that Edmonton has
been in the lead) have created all sorts of special programs. 
</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
When
British Prime Minister David Cameron spoke to the Canadian
Parliament, he mentioned that Alberta schools routinely rank higher
than those of any other English-speaking jurisdiction in
international tests of educational competence. The fact is
interesting in itself, but the reason behind it is even more
interesting – that there is such a high degree of competition in
Alberta’s educational sector. Of course, a degree of educational
competition exists in other provinces, but Alberta has gone further
by combining all forms of competition present in Canada with other 
</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
The
first level of competition is that between public and Catholic
schools. Alberta has always funded both systems to the same degree,
so the competition between them is on a level playing field. Given
the prevalence of mixed marriages today, many parents can choose to
send their children to either type of school.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
Another
level of competition is provided by private schools, both religious
and secular. Depending on certain factors, private schools can
receive either 60 per cent or 70 per cent of the per pupil provincial
grant paid to the public and Catholic systems, while recovering the
rest of their costs from tuition. This subsidy brings private
education within the means of many Alberta families.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
Parents
deeply committed to some special educational approach can choose
private schools that receive no subsidy because they don’t teach
the Alberta curriculum, or the option of home schooling. These
parents are free to spend extraordinary amounts of money or time on
what they perceive to be their children’s future welfare.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
And
then there are the 13 public charter schools first authorized by
Ralph Klein’s government in 1994. These schools are run by the
parents who group together to found them. With full public funding,
they’re not allowed to charge extra tuition, but they’re free to
follow (non-religious) educational approaches that may not exist in
the public system.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
As
these options proliferated, Alberta’s public system fought back.
Public trustees don’t want to lose students because that creates
immense political headaches over what to do with underpopulated
schools. So public schools (and it pains this Calgarian to say that
Edmonton has been in the lead) have created all sorts of special
programs, sometimes even special schools, for the gifted and the
learning disabled, for aspiring athletes and artists, even for girls
and boys.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
Throw
French and bilingual schools into the mix, and there’s an
incredible menu from which parents can choose. Students are bused all
over town and into the countryside in pursuit of the option they and
their parents find to be the best for them. If the neighbourhood
public school is still the favourite option, that’s because the
public schools have had to improve their offerings under pressure
from all these forms of competition.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
What
has happened in Alberta education can be a model for other social
services, such as health care. Look at the big picture. There’s a
fully funded public system available to anyone who wants to use it,
but there are also other options – some partially supported with
public revenue, others completely private. Far from destroying the
public sector, competitive pressure has caused it to improve to the
point where it’s now among the best in the world.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
Those
parents willing to invest some of their time and money in education
become benefactors to those who prefer to use the public system,
because private investments lead indirectly to improvements in the
public sector. Our deteriorating health-care system could learn a lot
from the example of education in Alberta.</p>

						<b>ERIC
						Digest 141 - October 2000</b></p>
						<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in"><b>New
						Patterns of School Governance</b></p>
						<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in"><i>By
						Ron Renchler</i></p>
						<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">School
						governance has long been a political football, as local, state,
						and federal stakeholders work—sometimes cooperatively and
						sometimes at odds—to establish or influence policy and then
						implement accountability measures to track the quality of
						schools in the United States.</p>
						<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">Proponents
						of change have recently recommended a number of new
						approaches—and variations on old ones—to meet the complex
						challenge of improving public education through different forms
						of school governance. However, as with change in any
						organizational setting, resistance has been strong, and the
						public debate on the appropriateness of new models for school
						governance continues.</p>
						<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">This
						Digest explains why public-school governance is the subject of
						increasing scrutiny, identifies who is held accountable for
						results in the current governance system, and describes several
						recent proposals for transforming governance structures.</p>
						<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in"><b>Why
						Are Changes in School Governance Being Recommended?</b></p>
						<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">Most
						of the past decade’s education reforms were initiated at the
						state or the school level, bypassing or ignoring the school
						board and district office. Now reformers are zeroing in on this
						neglected middle level of governance, hoping that some
						changes—perhaps a redefinition of the role of school boards,
						closer teamwork between board and superintendent, or
						experimentation with new governance structures—will
						indirectly stimulate improved performance at the school and
						classroom.</p>
						<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">The
						latest round of debate about the most effective models for
						school governance was precipitated by the publication in
						November 1999 of Governing America’s Schools: Changing the
						Rules, a report issued by the National Commission on Governing
						America’s Schools and sponsored by the Education Commission
						of the States.</p>
						<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">The
						commission’s report documents the variety of performance
						standards by which American schools are being judged.
						Especially problematic has been the issue of lagging
						performance among minority students and students in urban
						areas.</p>
						<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">Although
						there is little quantitative evidence that governance
						structures affect student academic achievement, more people
						seem willing to experiment with altering those structures in
						the hope that the changes will stimulate educators and students
						to perform at a higher level.</p>
						<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">As
						Kirst and Bulkley (2000) note, &quot;reformers will continue to
						use governance and organizational changes in an effort to
						improve the performance of education, even though these
						mechanisms may offer an indirect and uncertain strategy for
						improving classroom instruction.&quot;</p>
						<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in"><b>Who’s
						Accountable in the Governance System?</b></p>
						<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">Much
						of the discussion of governance focuses on the sometimes rocky
						relationships among teachers, principals, superintendents, and
						school boards. The implication is that poor school performance
						won’t be adequately addressed until these groups work
						together as a team.</p>
						<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">Some
						critics blame the system itself and call for systemic change,
						while others favor workarounds to the current system, such as
						vouchers, school-choice programs, and privatization. Moreover,
						states differ so widely in their educational governance
						structures that it is difficult to prescribe a
						one-size-fits-all solution. A brief list of modern-day
						governance interest groups includes mayors, unions, business
						leaders, politicians, and community leaders, in addition to
						teachers, principals, superintendents, and school boards
						(National Commission).</p>
						<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">Superintendents,
						especially in urban districts, have taken more than their fair
						share of the blame for the weaknesses in current school
						governance systems. Firing the superintendent is usually the
						first step in addressing governance problems, but this response
						seems only to have contributed to a high turnover rate and &quot;has
						often hindered efforts to improve schools&quot; (Johnston
						2000).</p>
						<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">School
						boards are the other traditional targets in the school
						governance blame game. Numerous observers have been critical of
						school boards and their role in public education, especially
						the way they interact with school superintendents (Carver 2000,
						Dawson and Quinn 2000, Edwards 2000, McAdams and Urbanski
						1999).</p>
						<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">A
						report by the Educational Research Service and the New England
						School Development Council (Goodman and Zimmerman 2000) notes
						that &quot;too many state laws require or allow boards to
						engage in the operational detail of a school system,&quot; such
						as hiring staff and adopting textbooks. State laws should limit
						the board’s role to policymaking, assign day-to-day
						operations to the superintendent, and, most important, says the
						report, empower board and superintendent to function as a
						unified leadership team.</p>
						<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in"><b>What
						Did the ECS Commission Recommend?</b></p>
						<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">Recognizing
						the political and administrative realities of school
						governance, the National Commission on Governing America’s
						Schools recommended, without preference, one of two forms of
						governance: &quot;(1) a system of publicly authorized, publicly
						funded and publicly operated schools, based on some of the more
						promising trends within the prevailing system of public
						education governance, and (2) a system of publicly authorized,
						publicly funded and independently operated schools, based on
						some of the more promising alternatives to the prevailing
						system of public education governance.&quot;</p>
						<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">The
						first recommendation extends current governance structures to
						include a few experimental strategies; the second
						recommendation effectively argues for increased privatization
						of school governance.</p>
						<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">Writing
						in Education Week, two commission members, Donald R. McAdams
						and Adam Urbanski (1999), provide different views on the issues
						raised by the report. McAdams argues that a system of
						independently operated schools—the second option in the
						commission’s report—would allow school boards to &quot;govern
						more and manage less.&quot; He believes that if schools were
						run by &quot;individual nonprofit and for-profit organizations,
						cooperatives, sole proprietorships, and the like,&quot; boards
						would be free of the need to focus on the details of how
						schools are run and instead could &quot;set standards, provide
						resources, and demand results.&quot;</p>
						<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">Urbanski
						favors the first option—keeping schools publicly operated and
						improving current governance structures. He believes
						decentralized governance structures would allow changes at the
						classroom level, where &quot;faculty, staff, and parents in
						each community and at each school would have greater authority
						and capacity to tailor the teaching and learning methods to
						meet high standards as well as the unique needs of their
						students.&quot;</p>
						<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in"><b>What
						Other School Governance Models Have Been Proposed?</b></p>
						<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">A
						few economically based strategies for changes in school
						governance have been proposed since the publication of the
						commission’s report. Wang and Walberg (1999) recommend a
						system of governance whereby states and local boards would
						create basic standards that schools could devise their own ways
						to meet.</p>
						<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">Thereafter,
						the authors say, schools would be free from &quot;operational
						regulation or close supervision.&quot; Schools that failed to
						meet the standards would have a set of educational &quot;best
						practices&quot; imposed upon them. Continued failure to meet
						standards would call for a clean sweep of staff or complete
						school closure, &quot;in which case… students could be given
						scholarships to attend nearby public or private schools.&quot;
						Thus, all schools, public or private, would essentially become
						entrepreneurial enterprises. &quot;Let schools set their own
						goals, standards, curricula, and character,&quot; the authors
						suggest. &quot;Let competition for students decide which is
						best.&quot;</p>
						<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">A
						strategy for school governance with a business mold has been
						made popular in the recent work of John Carver (2000), whose
						Policy Governance model assigns the school superintendent a
						role parallel to that of the corporate CEO. Carver says the
						role of the school board is &quot;to govern the system, rather
						than run it.&quot; He claims that school boards have
						traditionally micromanaged the educational process, something
						that would spell doom for any manager in a business setting.</p>
						<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">A
						radical redesign of the function of school boards, Carver
						explains, would include (1) a focus on educational results
						rather than on the methods by which they were achieved, (2)
						newly defined relationships with the general public and
						parents, and (3) a commitment on the part of the board to speak
						with one voice rather than as a group of individuals with
						individual agendas.</p>
						<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">Changing
						or improving the relationship between the superintendent and
						school board looms large in almost all proposals for different
						governance structures. Edwards (2000), a school board member in
						Illinois for many years, suggests a form of governance that
						&quot;takes the decision-making power out of the hands of the
						few (the board) and places it into the hands of many (parents,
						teachers, administrators, and community members).&quot; Edwards
						puts the locus of control at the building level. &quot;How
						absurd,&quot; Edwards notes, &quot;to perpetuate a system in

						<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">Dawson
						and Quinn (2000), partners in a leadership development
						consulting firm, put Carver’s Policy Governance model to the
						test in several districts in Colorado. In describing the
						experiences of their clients, the authors report that the
						school boards were better able to focus on policy issues and
						that superintendents were better able to carry out the
						day-to-day operations for which they were responsible.</p>
						<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">Notable
						among recent developments in school governance has been the
						takeover of several districts by outside entities when schools
						fail to make adequate progress on their own. For a variety of
						reasons, these takeovers have occurred mostly in urban
						districts (Anderson and Lewis 1997).</p>
						<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">Kirst
						and Bulkley (2000) describe the recent mayoral takeovers of
						several urban districts, including Chicago, Boston, Detroit,
						and Cleveland. Whether mayors can successfully become
						educational leaders remains an open question, and the effect of
						mayoral control on overall school performance will certainly be
						difficult to document.</p>
						<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">Cibulka
						(2000) concludes that &quot;public school educators may help to
						reshape the institution by their willingness to experiment with
						new institutional forms, but they are unlikely to preserve the
						‘one best system’ as we have known it.&quot; He notes that
						&quot;resistance to change&quot; in old structures &quot;is
						likely to further weaken the institution’s capacity to
						achieve its goals, and to maintain its legitimacy and
						survival.&quot;</p>

<h1>About School Trustees</h1>
<h2>The Purpose of the Position of Trustees</h2>
<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
The
primary purpose of the school trustee is to represent the parents and
the needs of the school children in the area the board or district
represents. Trustees participate in the discussions and decisions of
the school boards. Federal and provincial legislation describe the
responsibilities of the school trustee as: 
</p>
<ol>
	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0in">
	To attend meetings of the school boards and exercise the powers and
	the duties of a trustee in good faith. 
	</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">To comply with
	the requirements of the regulations concerning conflict of interest.
		</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0.19in">To comply
	with all the requirements of the School Act, the Regulations and
	Minister's directives. 
	</p></li>
</ol>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Therefore, the trustee is not only a
decision-maker, acting in concert with the other trustees on the
Board, but is also an agent of the Minister of Education to ensure
the School Act, the Regulations and Minister's directives are
followed.</p>
<h2>Responsibilities of Trustees</h2>
<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
Section
49 of the School Act outlines the responsibilities of the school
boards. Ultimately, it is up to the school board to ensure fulfilment
of its responsibilities. These responsibilities are: 
</p>
<ol>
	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0in">
	The provision of instruction in an educational program to all those
	enrolled and eligible. 
	</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">To provide for
	the management of staff and its staff development needs. 
	</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">To provide for
	and manage facilities and equipment. 
	</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">To provide
	transportation for students. 
	</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">To manage the
	financial affairs of the school board. 
	</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">To monitor and
	evaluate the effectiveness of schools. 
	</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">To ensure the
	development and approval of school improvement plans. 
	</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0.19in">To encourage
	good relations among schools, parents and the community, and to
	promote awareness of the importance of education. 
	</p></li>
</ol>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Section 50 of the School Act outlines
areas in which a school board may develop policies. They include
providing educational programs and services, the administration and
management of staff, facilities and equipment, as well as the
financial affairs of the board, the suspension and expulsion of
students, student attendance, assessment of students, conducting
pilot or local programs, and finally, the management of volunteer
services.</p>
<h2>Requirements of a Trustee</h2>
<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
Trustees:

</p>
<ul>
	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0in">
	must be a Canadian citizen, 
	</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">must be a
	resident in the school unit for at least six months prior to the
	election day, and 
	</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0.19in">cannot be an
	employee of any school board or the Department of Education. 
	</p></li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
French
Language School Board trustees must meet one of the following
qualifications: 
</p>
<ul>
	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0in">
	must be the parent of a student receiving French first language
	instruction on PEI, or

	</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0.19in">must be
	eligible to have a child receive French first-language instruction,
	if the candidate had a child. 
	</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Nomination</h2>
<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
To
be nominated as a candidate for school trustee, any 10 or more
persons, who also meet the requirements to be a trustee, as stated
above, may nominate a candidate for the zone in which the nominator
resides. The nomination is made by filing, with the zone returning
officer, a nomination paper in the form approved by the Chief
Electoral Officer, at any time between the beginning date of the
election campaign and 4:00 p.m. on nomination day.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
Nomination
day will be Friday, the seventeenth day before ordinary polling day.
Following nomination day, the Chief Electoral Officer determines the
eligibility of candidates. The names of all eligible candidates will
be published in provincial newspapers. Details regarding the
electoral zones and polling stations will also be published at that
time.</p>
<h2>Length of Terms</h2>
<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
School
trustees are elected for a four-year term. Where an election produces
fewer than the prescribed number of trustees of a school board,
Executive Council shall appoint, from those eligible to be
candidates, the additional members necessary to bring the number of
trustees to the total. The term of those appointed is also four years
or the amount of the term remaining, up to four years.</p>

The
way schools are run has changed dramatically, says Fiona Millar –
but some may suffer if they are given more freedom</p>

<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
It
is exactly 18 years since I first became a governor at my local
primary school. Last month, I stood down after 10 years as chair.
Next month, I will attend my last full meeting of the governing body.
In that time, I have seen five governments come and go, read more
initiatives than I can remember, seen three children through the
school, worked with four headteachers and been through as many Ofsted
inspections.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
The
governing body I am leaving behind bears no resemblance to the one I
joined in 1992, when the school was cleverly run by a headteacher who
had a considerable degree of autonomy (even then) and who conspired
to let us know as little as possible about what was really going on.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
Governing
body meetings sometimes ran late into the night, but went nowhere, as
a slow war of attrition was waged between newer governors who wanted
information and change, and those who colluded with the head to keep
us in our place.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
We
were one of the first <u><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/schools" name="More from guardian.co.uk on Schools">schools</a></u>
to be inspected under the then new Ofsted regime and the result was
shocking, but, with hindsight, not surprising. Inspectors shone a
bright light into some murky corners and revealed a dysfunctional
institution, poorly led, in which many class teachers were
floundering and pupils failing.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
The
head departed, and we rather naively thought our problems were over.
They weren't. Over the next six years, the school haemorrhaged
parents, teachers and pupils. Our free school meals numbers doubled
to over 60%, we slumped to the bottom of the league tables and heads
came and went, but the parents and other governors who stuck by the
school became empowered. The &quot;big society&quot; has been around
a lot longer than some younger politicians realise.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
We
didn't need or want more freedom, just the terrific headteacher we
eventually found. With support from the community and local
authority, the school turned around. My belief in the power of
parents to effect change in this way is one reason why I, with
others, have now set up the Local Schools Network for people who want
to support their local schools rather than rush off and start new
ones.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
In
my time as a governor, the context in which schools operate has
changed dramatically. It has become fashionable to rubbish the overly
bureaucratic, centrally directed initiatives of the Blair/Brown
governments, but on balance they were right for schools like ours.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
New
buildings, extra resources and extended services were rightly matched
by a requirement for better <u><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/teaching" name="More from guardian.co.uk on Teaching">teaching</a></u>
and leadership, higher expectations, and more rigour, accountability
and transparency. Maybe only those of us who remember the late
eighties and early nineties fully appreciate what has been done.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
As
it happens, on the day I stepped down as chair, Michael Gove
abolished the self-evaluation form in favour of letting schools find
their own preferred method of self-evaluation. Ours had just been
completed, and was on the agenda for that night's meeting, during
which one new governor explained how much he had learned from it,
even before walking across the school's threshold for the first time.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
Of
course, even within a centrally prescribed system, a school's
self-evaluation is only as good as the head and senior team. The
effectiveness with which it is acted on, only as good as the
governing body's understanding of roles and responsibilities.
Nevertheless, in 2010, many governing bodies can take for granted
what we so desperately needed 18 years ago.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
I
think I can write the script for what will happen in schools where
more freedom is given, where light touch or non-existent inspection
is required, particularly if a good head or chair of governors is
replaced by a less competent one. Reading Stephanie Northen's piece,
opposite, only confirms my fears.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
Headteachers
often want more autonomy, and that is understandable. We would all
probably rather do our jobs without someone looking over our
shoulders. But the balance between freedom and accountability is a
delicate one. Giving heads more freedom, and making them less
accountable, is fine if they are good, but could have disastrous
consequences for the parents and pupils it is supposed to help if
they are not.</p>
