  5 Standards 
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Don differentiates between school-based testing for instructional purposes and external certification testing for employment/advancement qualification. He argues schools should assess learning progress to inform teaching strategies, while society needs separate external assessment confirming skill levels for hiring, licensing, and advanced study entry. Proposing an independent provincial qualification authority to assess individual achievement separately from school grading, Don notes such models exist (Apprenticeship, International Baccalaureate). External testing would improve consistency, reduce teacher workload, minimize cheating, and increase system flexibility.</div>

<p>Dear Editor:</p>
<p><b>Standards</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>It’s time to rethink standards; our current practice of asking for or requiring high school graduation as an entrance requirement to postsecondary studies or employment acts as a barrier to change in public education and, in fact, may not be the best for either entry into employment or further education. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Schools are teaching institutions; their role is to help people learn.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The testing schools do is, or should be, for the purpose of understanding what has been learned or not learned, and how to develop other teaching/learning strategies.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Society also has an interest, and a need for testing, but this one is to ascertain the level that a person or a group has achieved on a skill or set of skills.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Society uses this information when making decisions about job entry, certification or the ability to succeed in advanced study.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Examples of the latter include skill level to drive safely on public highways, skill levels of people who maintain sophisticated medical equipment and skill levels of those who teach our young people.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The latter are not part of the teaching function; in fact, in my view, the latter ts not an even an education function</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>It is time for PEI to consider an independent ‘qualification authority” to assess levels of achievement for individuals or organizations who need or want such a service.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Its role would be to, on request, to assess a individuals educational and to provide the individual with the results.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The Department of Education may use it as a replacement for school marks awarding provincial certificates, employers may only require a specified level of math or communication skills; the college or usiversith may use it as a testing service for new entrants, individuals may.use it as a part of a job application.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Apprenticeship, the International Bacclaureate Program are examples of this approach</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Having an independent testing service should improve consistency, reduce teachers’ workload and minimize cheating, and probability improve system flexibility</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
<p><br></p>
