  Mtg 36 Note
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Don&#x27;s memo to board directors prior to April 4 meeting outlines organizational transition planning and governance structure work. Don proposes &quot;reset&quot; of Education 20/20 to clarify organizational purpose, increase community profile, and regularize operations. Indicates each director will receive a comprehensive package of organizational documents including promotional materials, company information, director list, vision statement, board regulations, bylaws, goal-based plans, and occasional papers. Proposes formal review and confirmation of: role of Secretary, role of Treasurer, role of Awards Committee, role of Souris Project Committee. Notes three-year director appointments with option for single renewal followed by one-year minimum break. Proposes annual executive elections with past president chairing nominating committee. Don expresses willingness to step down as Chair at any time but willing to serve additional months/year to ease transition and indicates desire to delegate operations if re-elected. Proposes setting Annual Meeting for mid-May and offers his cottage in Earnscliffe as potential retreat/planning location with BBQ/social option. Notes need to recruit replacement for Anne Miller given quorum issues. This memo reflects Don&#x27;s sophisticated understanding of governance best practices and commitment to organizational stability.</div>

<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.11in; line-height: 108%">
<b>3	I think that we should also formalize terms and appointments of
Directors.  The regulations call for a three-year appointment of
Directors who may be reappointed for a second term after which they
must take a minimum one-year break.  The executive is normally
elected annually with a past President acting as a chair of a
nominating committee. As for President, I’ve indicated a desire to
step down as Chair any time, however, I will be happy to serve for a
few months or a year longer if it will ease the transition process.
If I am re-elected,  I plan to delegate operations and ask others to
report on their areas of responsibility at each meeting.</b></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.11in; line-height: 108%">
<b>4 	 We need to set a date for Annual Meeting; perhaps around
mid-May.  I am pleased to offer our cottage in Earnscliffe as a place
to meet, lay out plans for the coming year, even have a barbeque or
glass of wine, if that is of interest.</b></p>

<b>5	I have not acted to replace Anne Miller but, given our earlier
issues with quorum will move to do so shortly.</b></p>
