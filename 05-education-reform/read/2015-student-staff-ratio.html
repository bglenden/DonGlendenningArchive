  2015-student staff ratio  
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Don draws from personal leadership experience, noting he once declined a position when the board attempted to dictate organizational structure. He argues that student-staff ratios, while useful to administrators for funding allocation, indicate little about school service quality. Effective staffing decisions should occur at school level, accounting for individual staff strengths and school context. Don references research supporting team teaching, focused professional development, and assigning diagnosis and assessment to specialist teachers. He recalls a transformative assignment from Professor Gibson to design a university organization based on Kant, illustrating how intellectual challenge creates lasting learning.</div>

<p>Dear Sir:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Student staff ratios</p>
<p>The issue of student staff ratio keeps popping up.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is an area of interest to me personally because I once turned down an offer because the Board-to-be tried to interfere with my proposed organization.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Student staff ratio may be useful to administrators when allocating funds but, as one report said, has little relevance as an indicator of the quality of service offered by a school.</p>
<p>My sense of the issue is that staffing decisions can best be made at the school level taking into account the strengths of existing staff members nature of the school and strengths of existing staff and biggest timewasters especially of professional staff.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The literature supports team teaching, focused staff development, with diagnosing, prescribing, and assessment of students assigned to specialist teachers.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Patterns may differ from school to school, not necessarily cheaper but dollars will likely be spend differently.</p>
<p>Many years ago my Professor of Higher Education, Dr. Gibson, told the class to “read Kant and hand in a paper on how you would organize a university”; the learning that resulted from the assignment has stood me in good stead ever since.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Don Glendenning</p>
<p>A long-time student of education</p>
