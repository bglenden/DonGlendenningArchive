  D 2013-Exemptions
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Don supports Keith Hogg&#x27;s proposal allowing students to exempt courses through successful exam performance, drawing on his own university experience. He argues exemptions create incentives, allow customized learning paths, and prevent repetition of already-mastered material. The letter advocates for individual flexibility within school systems and positions exemption policies as having no downside, worth implementing as an experiment. It reflects Don&#x27;s student-centered perspective and belief that educational systems should accommodate individual learning needs and pace.</div>

<p>Dear Sir:</p>
<p><b>High School Exemptions</b></p>
<p>Keith Hogg made the suggestion (‘Exams fail to prepare students for the workforce’, The Guardian, March 7, 2013) that high school students be allowed to write exams and, if successful, be exempt from taking the courses.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It makes sense and would be a real incentive to students.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I’ve had it happen twice during my university studies but I’ve also sat through courses where the material had already been covered in an earlier course or by another teacher; there was nothing wrong with the material, it was just that it was a repeat. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Under an exemption policy, students could spend more time on subjects where help is needed, study a different subject, or even finish early.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There are so many new and exciting things to learn, it’s a shame to think that students must spend valuable school hours listening to things they already know. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>What would the impact of an exemption policy be on learners and learning?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>All positive, I would venture.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Is there a downside?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I can’t think of any; at the least, it is worth a try. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Don Glendenning</p>
