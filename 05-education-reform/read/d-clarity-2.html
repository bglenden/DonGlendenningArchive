</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Draft (Doc5/Hand2, labeled &quot;Guardian-clarity&quot;) on education complexity and missing public conversation. Don documents disconnects between education literature and practice: learners learn at own pace but assigned same time; literature emphasizes soft skills but curriculum lacks them; essential skills lists differ between education literature and Department graduation requirements; curriculum excludes everyday competencies; Department limits itself to youth education. Lists role uncertainties and structural issues. Calls for purpose clarity and discussion about education structure versus school facilities.</div>

<div class="reader-content">
<p><b>Clarity: an education issue</b></p>
<p>Doc5/Hand2</p>
<p>Education is a complex matter.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Not only are we all different, but we have different interests, requirements and capabilities,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Typically, people fill six life<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>roles, that of<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>an individual, citizen, learner, family member, producer and consumer.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The literature identifies the following essential skills<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Literacy, Numeracy, Everyday Science, Self Management, information technology, Personal relationships, Community awareness, Emotional Awareness and our graduation requirements include English, math, science, social studies, physical ducion, career ducation and some elective s. Add to that typical education services of governance, information, counselling, products and technology, quality control, assessment, instruction and education becomes<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>complex and<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>teaching difficult. No wonder some people, including the writer, become confused.</p>
<p>I know that the Department publishes detailed program releases and special reports but wha’s missing is public conversation, some call I connectedness, between the education system and the people it serves. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p>‘<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>It’s time to update and claify our mandate; it’s time for conversation about what we want in the way of educational services and how to best organize them.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>No, I/m not suggesting the services of an outside expert.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We can do it ourselves. les I’ve found are not clear, What is the education plan? Should we have an education plan</p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li3">Learners learn at own pace yet<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>e assign learners the same amount f time to learn selected concepts</li>
  <li class="li3">The literature tells us abut the importance of “soft skills” in the 21s century yet I’ve not encountered changes to school curriculum that reflect this view</li>
  <li class="li3">Literature lists essential skills but Department creates own list as graduation requirements</li>
  <li class="li3">School curriculum seem not to include competencies people use in everyday lives</li>
  <li class="li3">Department of Education limits itself to Education o youth; appears not to recognize responsibility for all citizens</li>
  <li class="li3">Literature defines levels in terms of length o suy</li>
  <li class="li3">Mustn’t we have a clear purpose to measure/grade?</li>

<p>As for PEI:</p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li5">The PEI Department website gives it’s role as one of :developing and delivering “programs and<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>curriculum …”</li>
  <li class="li5">The PEI purpose as one of “ <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li5">New Zealand purpose as one of “</li>
  <li class="li5">Unknown “promote and support”</li>
  <li class="li5">Regulate</li>
  <li class="li5"></li>
</ul>

<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Role uncertain; a World Bank<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>report on education in 2018<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>reminded us that going to school and gaining an education are not the same thing; the difference needs to be affirmed in PEI as well. In fact, until we are clear on our education plans, it is hard to tell just were schools fit in.</p>
<p>Learning is about changing the way we think, feel and act; teaching is about arranging experiences that help others change the way they think, feel or act. Schools are purpose built facilities where learners can get help<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>with their learning. It is not surprising, as the Wolrd Bank points, that sometimes people confuse learning and going to school.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I sometimes think of a school being like a hospital or shopping centre; they house resources but those who attend may not purchase anything or return to good health.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Some reasons for that conclusion include:</p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li5">Given that individuals learn at their own rate, the length of time one has been in school is not a very reliable measure of how much one has learned. The alternative is a set a standard and allow students time to meet it.</li>
  <li class="li5">Education is typically comprised of a number of services - <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>information, instruction, counselling, assessment, learning products and technology, etc; most can be offered most anywhere. Some services require special facilities and groups.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But going to school is not itself an educational service.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I liken a school to a hospital or shopping plaza.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li5">I’m puzzled by the title “Education and Lifelong learning” in the name of the Department; doesn’t education already include lifelong learning?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
</ul>
<p>Certainly instructional<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>services usually benefit from being in a single location; non-instructional services such as Information and counselling , however, may serve equally well or even better<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>if located off campus used by the Department of Education</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>A lexicon of common educational terms may be in order</p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
<p><br></p>
