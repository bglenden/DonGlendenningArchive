<p><b>Dear Sir:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b><b></b></p>
<p><b>Role of a Department of Education<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b>Future of Education</b></p>

<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>The gap between those who provide educational services on Prince Edward Island and those who use education services is widening, and Islanders are the worse for the change; something should be done about it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Although neither the current nor the previous Minister are the cause of the decline, the current Minister, it seems, is the only person with authority to effect changes and reverse the trend.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>First to the vision.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The vision for<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>education has narrowed during my time on PEI. The lower rings of the education ladder seem to have disappeared.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Essential skills and math<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>facts seem to have gone by the wayside.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>People long for the return of PVI and PCVHS.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The federal government, long the champion of workforce training, seems to have withdrawn from the arena and only contributes money. One only has to read the first few lnes on the Department website to spot the ifference<span class="Apple-converted-space">     </span></b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>In spite of the Departments title, Im not sure that education is actually on the the government genda; no mention of increasing basic skills, improving work preparation, Math facts, skillsincreasing relevance, solving the duplication of adult education servicea, or continuing education throughout the Island.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Not only does the partment seems yo enjoy reunning schools , it seems, inot on the agenda Cannot rmrmmber when I heard our leadrs speak of standards and improving<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We explain our latest standing on PISA results but fail to act on how to improve them improving literach, work skills</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>ublic education needs long term and overarching principles; politics thrives on events. Education suffers.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Achieving better education is stalled. Time for a public conversation, a functional analysis and a review of rcommendations by UNICEF and the OECD.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>By then, a structures hould be obvious.</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>1 I am unsure of their intentions, it’s a style of writing that describes but doesn’t clarify what public education</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Education is a developmental process service.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Cooperation/ collaboration, partnerships, fExpand services only sees renning of school</b></p>
<p><b>All employees should use ce when discussing their employer and their work’ the fear factor is real, I’ve encountered it directly. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Businesses who fear losing contracts, educators who mat lose promotions if not jobs, <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>

<p><b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Education needs and deserves a non- partisan educator in charge of educationas leader; as separate from Government as is the President of the UPEI or Holland College. The Province may continue to run schools, if it wishes, but professional leadership should be a separate responsibility.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Health services seemed <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>to bridge tht gp but Im sure there are other models.</b></p>

<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>It’s unclear from the PEI literature just what we are trying to do under the education umbrella. today– so lets start here.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Perhaps we should begin with a hands-on show and tell, open to the public,of items in our current education play box; each toy to be demonstrated by an experienced player with no question ignored<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>nor<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>answer stintingly given.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Though separated from theactual<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>toys, we should also examinee the red tape tha cleverly entangle all woho jourrny the education pat.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>

<p><b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>eldom providedquestions and questioning s suppressed, issues re not beng<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>addressedI say this because it seems as though the Department has a narrower vision than the public at large; the media may also have a narrower definition. The Government’s definition is important because Governmet s such an important player in<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>the field.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>I’ve thought this<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>for some time;<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Department of Education and Childhood Development in Nova Scotia and “Education and Lifelong Learning” puzzles me as I consider lifelong learning and Early Childhood were simply part of an education system.<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>I am now wondering where night classes, vocational education, personal development classes and part time students, home schooling and independent study fit in.</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>It appears that part time nd continuing education has fallen out of favour; Souri numbers have droppd dramatically in recent year; perhaps continuing education continuing education has been replaced by online courses.<span class="Apple-converted-space">          </span>.</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>continuing education; perhaps continuing and part tim educationBut it is not really about definitions, it’s more about<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>a mechanism to ensure that all Islanders can access educational services.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I was actually quite shocked to visit Souris and findso little in the way of continuing education.</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>, for instance,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>and find so little available in the way of continuing educationand find no one finding a system that best serves the needs of Islanders.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>n education system that will best serve the needs of Islandersproviing educational services ro Islandersy about how we propote and organize srvices in services are organized to servecommunication and organization to serve Island communities.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>For example, I.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I a surprised, for instance, about</b></p>

<p><b>t’s ok to have a different definition butwelooks as though the epatment as a iferent, may I say narrower versio, han I amsed to.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>in fact, I am of the view that a public discussion of purposes,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>services, elements, expectations and results is long over and education service will not improve until that happens.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Islanders will not receive services they need or pay for. Issued that I think would benefit from public discussion include:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b>Education: What it is? Where and how does one get it, can I select my own education? WhyHow is it related to<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>schools? how do toy get it, how to measure, how do you know when you have enough<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b>Who is<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>responsible for my education? Myself, Parents? Teacher? Principal?</b></p>
<p><b>If I nt more, dfferent or better education who should I talk with?</b></p>
<p><b>Timing – if learning is a personal matter, have different kinds and levels of prior learning and different plans, why are they all put together and progress measured ini time based grades?</b></p>
<p><b>Aren’t teachers and institutions not in conflict when thy assign grades and levels to those they teach?</b></p>
<p><b>Which education services should governments pay for and for how long?</b></p>
<p><b>Why do we rank students?</b></p>
<p><b>Why do we discriminate against prt time and short coure training</b></p>
<p><b>Why is<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>education so expeses</b></p>
<p><b>Why does province operate schools</b></p>
<p><b>Province role is to encourage, support and regulate; firt problem comes when<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Province tries to do everything itself</b></p>
