  2 Philosophy
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Don critiques the small school closure strategy as contradicting evidence, then pivots to the urgent need for updating PEI&#x27;s 28-year-old Philosophy of Education. He proposes a short, clear, crisp statement starting with definitions (education, schools, schooling, graduation, grades, pass/fail, government role, employment relationship, parental role) followed by guiding principles: education for democratic participation, learner/parent responsibility, individual learning differences, government&#x27;s equity-ensuring leadership role, workforce development responsibility, education as profession, developmental process, and schools as educational service delivery. He argues this framework must precede curriculum, standards, and facility decisions.</div>

<p>February 12. 2017</p>

<p>Editor,</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Dear Sir:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>	<b>Starting over	 <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p>The decision to close a number of small schools in PEI seems to fly in the face of prevailing information which says, in effect, that small schools work, the cost per graduate is less than in large schools, small schools serve small, remote and rural communities well and are satisfying places to work.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>What’s in play, it seems, is either the cost or conflicting views of education and the role of schools. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>But there is an urgent need to change and especially to update our “Philosophy of Education”; the current one, found on the website of the Department of Education, Early Learning and Culture, was written 28 years ago and is out of date. The last three decades brought many changes in the world around us, though less than many would like to the practices of education.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It’s time to formulate a new statement, one that is short, clear and crisp - a public statement of beliefs and direction.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The statement could start with a few definitions – education, schools, schooling, graduation, grades, pass and fail, role of government, relationship between school and employment, role of parents and students.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The statement should also include a few guiding principles such as:</p>
<p>The role of education is to help people develop attitudes, skills and knowledge needed to operate in a democratic society.</p>
<p>The primary responsibility for education rests with learners and their parents.</p>
<p>Each learner brings a unique mix of conditions, prior learning experiences and aspirations to each new learning situation.</p>
<p>The role of government is to encourage education among its citizens and to ensure quality and equity in the distribution of resources</p>
<p>Government has a responsibility to ensure that our community has the skilled people it needs to maintain and develop the place we call home.</p>
<p>Education should be treated as a profession with the professionals organizing and delivering services, and being accountable to clients for action taken</p>
<p>Educating is a developmental process.</p>
<p>The function of a school system is to deliver educational services if, as when and where<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>needed.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Once we have a framework in place, we can begin to deal with matters of curriculum, standards, facilities, priorities and such other components as form part of an education system.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p><br></p>

<p>A long-time student of education</p>
