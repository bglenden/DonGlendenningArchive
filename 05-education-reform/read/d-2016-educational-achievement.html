  D-2016 Educational achievement 
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">This document appears to be a duplicate of File 2, with identical content discussing grading systems as uncalibrated instruments and proposing independent assessment bodies rather than teachers conducting evaluations. It distinguishes formative assessment (diagnostic, teaching-focused) from summative assessment (sorting by achievement), arguing this distinction reveals fundamental conflicts of interest in teacher grading. The repeated inclusion suggests this letter was important enough to warrant multiple copies in his records, or may represent the final version kept for documentation alongside an earlier draft.</div>

<p>Dear Sir:</p>
<p><b>Calibrating educational achievement</b></p>
<p>The practice of grading students is thought to have originated at Yale in the late 1700’s and, in spite of being described in 1913 as “an absolutely uncalibrated instrument”, grades remain a significant component in determining the future of so many young lives. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Although I’ve had concerns about the issue for some time, problems with grading became much much clearer when Education 20/20 plotted a “Learning Path.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>(A description of the Leaning Path” may be found in Occasional Paper No. 4 at<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>HYPERLINK "http://www.education2020.ca" <span>www.education2020.ca</span>). The process was most revealing and confirmed my belief that:</p>
<p>Formative assessment is a diagnostic function; it is an important part of the teaching process and provides teachers with valuable information about how to help students along the learning path.</p>
<p>Summative assessment is process of sorting learners by level of achievement and is not s teaching function.</p>
<p>For teachers to participate in ranking and grading students constitutes a conflict of interest.</p>
<p>Where standards are needed, they should be set and measured by a body independent of people whoteach.</p>
<p>Diplomas and degrees are marketing tools of teaching institutions and should not be confused with describing a person’s level of education</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>We need a better way to both describe and measure progress along the learning path.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Don Glendenning</p>
<p>A long-time student of education</p>
