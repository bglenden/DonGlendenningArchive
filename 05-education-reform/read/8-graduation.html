  8 Graduation
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Glendenning reports on his survey of 40 education leaders (Deputy Ministers, university presidents, college presidents, superintendents) asking whether current graduation requirements predict success in post-secondary education or employment. Only one respondent affirmed that course patterns matter significantly. He contrasts existing requirements with New Zealand&#x27;s National Certificate in Employment Skills, which focuses on practical workplace competencies (reading, writing, listening, problem-solving, teamwork, cultural communication). He suggests PEI should adopt competency-based alternatives that better serve the 50% of students entering workforce rather than higher education.</div>

<p><br></p>
<p>Dear Editor:</p>
<p>G raduation requirements</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>For some time now, I have been interested in the matter of requirements for high school graduation. ln</p>
<p>fact, because of this interest, a few years ago I wrote to Deputy Ministers of Education across the</p>
<p>country and to a number of university presidents, college presidents and superintendents of education.</p>
<p>My quest was to try and uncover evidence, if any exists, as to the value of our current courses as</p>
<p>predictors of success in university and college. Also I was, and still am, interested in knowing if there is</p>
<p>any relationship between the courses now required for graduation and success in later employment.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Forty people responded to my request, including all Deputy Ministers, but only one suggested that the</p>
<p>pattern of courses was important. lf there is no evidence to support the current requirements, perhaps</p>
<p>we should consider some others.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>As part of my reading this weekend, I found an item from New Zealand, which describes a National</p>
<p>Certificate in Employment Skills. According to the brochure which I received, the National Certificate in</p>
<p>Employment Skills is intended to "show employers that you've achieved a range of skills which are</p>
<p>important in the workplace and that you are ready for the workforce". lt appears to be available to</p>
<p>people of any age and, I think, anyone can challenge for credit,</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>ln order to obtain a National Certificate in Employment Skills, a person must complete the following</p>
<p>units:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>. reading skills</p>
<p>. writing skills \</p>
<p>. active listening</p>
<p>. Presenting information</p>
<p>. Calculation skills</p>
<p>. Making and interpreting basic graphs and tables</p>
<p>, Using standard units of measurement</p>
<p>, Keyboarding skills</p>
<p>, Employee rights and responsibilities</p>
<p>, Problem solving</p>
<p>, Making career plans</p>
<p>;:ffi'JiJ[il::1;:ffiff::"</p>
<p>, Assertiveness</p>
<p>. Communication with people from other cultures</p>
<p>, Teamwork</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>It seems to me that such a certificate would be very useful to employers in Prince Edward lsland.</p>
<p>Furthermore, my understanding is that most of our young people go to work without benefit of</p>
<p>postsecondary education. Perhaps it's time to tip the scales a bit more in their favour.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
<p><br></p>
