  Mtg 35 Lifelong Learning Advisor Proposal
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">This comprehensive proposal details Education 20/20&#x27;s ambitious Lifelong Learning Advisor program for Prince Edward Island. The initiative proposes hiring a bilingual (English/French with potential Mandarin translation) advisor as single point of contact for all learning inquiries on PEI. Responsibilities include fielding phone/online/in-person inquiries, directing residents to resources, identifying continuing education gaps, creating new opportunities where demand exceeds supply, administering a live-calendar website, and managing website advertising for revenue generation. A partnership with a marketing firm would develop public awareness campaigns utilizing multiple media channels. Budget detailed at $225,000 for three-year pilot including office space ($800/month), advisor wages ($4,000/month), communication/office costs, media ($10,000/year during pilot), and website development ($5,000). Potential revenue streams identified as federal/provincial government, private donors, website self-generation, and organizational fundraising. This ambitious proposal reflects Don&#x27;s vision for addressing community education gaps through accessible, coordinated services.</div>

<p><b>Lifelong Learning Advisor Proposal</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>Education 20/20 proposes to pilot the role of a life-long learning advisor on Prince Edward Island. The proposal involves:</p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li3">Hiring a Lifelong Learning Advisor,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li3">Providing an office space for that person,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li3">Creating a website with a live calendar for Islanders to view and post learning opportunities on PEI, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li3">Creating and delivering a public awareness campaign to highlight the importance of lifelong learning</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p>The Lifelong Learning Advisor would be a single point of contact for all questions about learning. The Lifelong Learning Advisor’s role would be to field inquiries, by phone, online and in person, from residents of Prince Edward Island, to discuss their learning goals and direct them to available resources. It would be important that the Lifelong Learning Advisor be fluent in French as well as English. It would also be ideal if there was a connection to a Mandarin speaking individual for translation.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The Lifelong Learning Advisor would also be responsible for searching out learning opportunities available on Prince Edward Island, identifying gaps, and working towards creating new opportunities where there is demand, but lack of available programming.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He/She would also administer the Lifelong Learning website, ensuring the calendar is accurate and up-to-date. In order to generate some revenue for this project, groups providing learning opportunities, would be given the opportunity to highlight their program through featured placements on the website. Therefore, the Lifelong Learning Manager would also be responsible for seeking potential advertisers and managing advertisement on the website.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>With direction and advice from the Education 20/20 Board of Directors, the Lifelong Learning Advisor would work with a marketing firm to create and deliver public awareness campaigns highlighting the importance of lifelong learning and the availability of this resource. The public awareness campaign would make use of a broad range of media avenues, including social media and more traditional print, TV and radio ads, to ensure the message reaches Islanders of all ages, genders and ethnic backgrounds. The campaign would highlight success stories as well as unique and interesting opportunities for learning on PEI.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
