  D 2012 Acceptance
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Don uses a restaurant analogy to explore how consumers—especially employers—can respond to unmet educational expectations. He argues that public education&#x27;s monopoly status removes market incentives, but citizens retain political power through communication with leadership. He advocates for employers and the public to voice dissatisfaction with reading and writing standards directly to government decision-makers (Premier and cabinet). The draft suggests that unclear hiring specifications and low community expectations perpetuate low performance, requiring active stakeholder intervention.</div>

<p>Dear Sir:</p>
<p><b>Choices Expectations</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>My wife and I were out for dinner recently; one meal was excellent and one was not up to our expectations.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Next time out, what are our choices?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Do we choose a different restaurant or the same menu but another menu item?</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>People, especially but not only employers, tell me that reading and writing skills of graduates are not up to expectations.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>What are their choices?</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I had coffee and conversation recently with an old friend and former colleague; not surprising, the conversation turned to education in general, but the importance of communication skills in particular.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I posed a question as to why the public at large, and employers in particular, were not more vocal about the level of reading and writing of graduates. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The public, including employers, he said, have low expectations and a high tolerance for<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>a low level of communication skills.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Although I had not had it put that way before, the view is consistent with<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>other comments I’ve heard.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>What are their choices?</p>
<p>First, and most obvious, is to let supplier, the school, know that you are not satisfied with current service.</p>
<p>Public education is a monopoly and the menu at every school is essentially the same; selecting from another school will likely not make a difference.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The supplier, the school, will not feel any impact even if you use the services of a competitor, a private school.</p>
<p>Speak to a Director or the Chairman of the board, by this I mean the Premier and members of the cabinet.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We’ve given them a contract to run a school system.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If we are not happy with the service we should tell them so. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>More precise description of desireable qualifications, or competerncies may help but, at the end of the day, local employers have very few options.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>While it may be the result of unclear hiring specUnfortunately,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The cause is important, a review is timely, and there is considerable support for change from both within the system and the community at large. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It’s time to think outside the box.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Feel free to write me at<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>HYPERLINK "mailto:standards2020@gmail.com" <span>standards2020@gmail.com</span>.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p>Sincerely</p>
