  D-8 Qualification Authority 
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Revised and expanded version of qualification framework proposal. More extensive discussion of labour mobility patterns and how mobility may be hampered by lack of portable qualifications. Deeper analysis of credential vs. qualification distinction with emphasis on output vs. input measures. Discusses international models and apprenticeship/Red Seal as Canadian exceptions. Argues qualification authority would improve consistency, ease mobility, improve communications, encourage self-study, and reduce grade inflation. Emphasizes authority should assess individuals directly, not approve courses or institutions. Includes detailed proposal for independent structure accepting direct applications and issuing certificates based on demonstrated performance.

	<span lang="en-US">Labour
	mobility is a fact of life; our ancestors practiced it, so have most
	of us.  The difference is that circumstances around us have changed,
	numbers have increased, the pace has quickened and people travel
	further afield.  Labour</span><span lang="en-US">
	</span><span lang="en-US">mobility</span><span lang="en-US">
	refers to the movement of people from one part of the country to
	another but it also refers to the movement of workers both within
	and between occupational fields.  One example may be seen in the
	regular commute of Islanders between their home in PEI and their
	workplace in Alberta, another is the retraining needed when a town
	is devastated by a plant closing, and a third example of mobility is
	the education and experience that allows young people to live and
	work around the world.  Labour mobility is may be hampered
	geographic ties, lack of housing, unemployment benefits, licensing
	requirements, lack of portable qualifications, and lack of
	nationally recognized educational levels. If my reading of the
	literature is correct, Canada lags in its programs in support of
	still relies mostly on a myriad of academic credentials. </span>
	</p>
	<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0.14in">Part of the
	mobility problem is the confusion between credentials and
	qualifications.  Diplomas and degrees are credentials; they are
	awarded to people who have successfully completed a prescribed
	number and pattern of courses in an institution; one has to know
	quite a bit about the institution to know the quality of the
	product.  Qualifications, on the other hand, attest to the fact that
	the holder has demonstrated attitudes, skills and knowledge required
	to successfully perform in a role or at a task.  A
	qualifications authority is a body established under law and given
	the authority to assess, evaluate and certify a person’s level of
	performance on a task or set of tasks, competencies, outcomes.  The
	first, a credential implies that the holder knows something; the
	second tells what the holder can do with what he or she knows.  It’s
	a significant difference.</p>
	<h2 style="margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: 0in"><span style="font-weight: normal">To
	facilitate the movement of workers, both within a country and
	internationally, many countries have developed a qualification
	framework and a qualification authority to enforce it; Canada and
	the US are exceptions.  </span><span style="font-weight: normal">A
	qualifications authority is a body established under law and given
	the authority to assess, evaluate and certify a person’s level of
	performance on a task or set of tasks or competencies. 
	Qualification authorities operate under government legislation but
	often have their own governing structure.  While the nature of their
	work varies from country to county, qualification authorities
	usually perform direct assessments of individuals, </span><span lang="en-US"><span style="font-weight: normal">including

	accomplishment  in an occupation or field, setting standards and

	<p lang="en-US" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><span lang="en-US">Neither
	Canada nor the US has bought into the qualification concept, at
	least not yet.  As a result, we have training institutions issuing
	transcripts and credentials of their own making; attempts that have
	been made, have focused on input measures rather output- longer
	days, more subjects, additional technology and more training for
	teachers and administrators. One exception is </span>apprenticeship;
	although apprenticeship is a provincial responsibility, Provinces
	have found a way to both honour the jurisdictional boundaries and,
	at the same time, produce a qualification document recognized across
	the country.  We’ve done this through common analyses, both
	provincial and national examinations and an endorsement, a Red Seal.
	 Other exceptions include the work of the Royal Canadian
	conservatory of Music.<span lang="en-US"> </span>

	<p lang="en-US" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Canada needs a
	qualification framework and an independent body to run it.  By that
	I mean an authority to assess and certify a person’s level of
	performance on a task or set of tasks such as found in an occupation
	or field of study. Such an authority would reduce if not eliminate
	the confusion between teaching and sorting now faced by teachers,
	focus certification more clearly on performance that matters,
	support lifelong learning and self-directed study, allow schools to
	focus formative evaluation that  helping learners learn, and reduce
	major distractions for teachers caused by their involvement in the
	sorting process.  A qualification authority would, in effect, serve
	two clients, organizations desiring an assessment and individuals
	wanting to confirm the level and suitability of their
	qualifications. While qualification authorities, at least the ones
	we have reviewed, focus on approving, courses, accrediting
	institutions and analyzing current offerings; we believe in a
	qualification authority that assesses individuals directly, not one
	that massages the minutiae of hours, outcomes, teacher qualification
	of education providers. A qualification authority could also play a
	useful role in helping people identify gaps in their preparation for
	a given field of work.  
	</p>
	<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">We support a
	qualification authority that is independent with its own governing
	structure, accepts clients on direct application or by referral and
	Issues certificates as appropriate based on demonstrated performance
	and, on request, provides applicants with information on gaps to be
	filled to meet certification requirements, a qualification authority
	would not, however, organize competitions, rank students or grant
	credentials.  The main functions of a qualification authority would
	be to:<span lang="en-US"><b> </b></span>

	<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><span lang="en-US">A
	review of the literature certainly supports the value of a
	qualification framework; benefits include: easing the assessment
	burden on teachers and the school  system, improving the consistency
	in reporting achievement, helpful in comparing foreign credentials,
	easing the mobility process, improving communications between and

	self- study, reducing the problem of grade inflation, send an almost
	instant widespread recognition of what a person is able to do. 
	Governments in most countries have taken the leadership in
	developing a qualification framework: in the US, however, it appears
	to be coming primarily from the private sector.  Given that
	education in Canada is a Provincial responsibility, it is unlikely
	that the Government of Canada will move to fill the void.  It is a
	niche waiting to be filled.  That leaves it up either to Provinces
	to band together or the private sector.  Unless someone initiates
	some steps soon, the US agencies will fill that role in Canada by
	default.</span></p>
