<div class="reader-summary">This document describes Education 20/20 professional services and initiatives emerging from a Community Foundation of Prince Edward Island youth survey. It details a working group addressing the transition from secondary school to employment and further studies, identifying four key issues: the mathematics skill gap, varying math proficiency levels, assessment methodologies, and reporting processes for skill documentation.</div>

<p><b>Professional services</b></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li1"><b>As a response to a survey of youth by the Community Foundation of Prince Edward Island, Education 20/20 organized and hosted<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>a series of workshops throughout the Province to inform Islanders, including educators, of youth issues identified in the study, to confirm the findings to our own datisfaction, gather information on priorotoes. Copy of report, xxxx is included with supporting documents.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Arising out of the series, has come three separate initiatives:</b></li>
</ul>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Establishment of a small working committee to improve transition from secondary schools to both employment and further studies.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The working group includes representatives of Holland College, the University of Prince Edward Island, the Greater Charlottetown Area Chamber of Commerce and the Government of PEI.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Using mathematics as a pilot project, of employers, post secondary institutions and the public at larege Mathematics was chosen as a pilot.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Four issues have been identified:</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>The gap:<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>what constitutes the gao?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>What do employers expect in the way of mathematics that recent graduates do not have.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Solving this issue will require an identification of what is being taught, what has been learned an how to convey the information.</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Math levels: While what is taught clearly identified and regulated, what learners have learned is less clear and the same grade from different schools may differ<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>significantly.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The committee is of the view that a common set of outcomes or competencies is required; so far, a suitable analysis has not been found with the likely result that one will need to be developed, after which, a standard set of levels will have to be agreed upon.</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Assessment: The committee found that schools rely primarily on ranking</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Reporting process</b></p>
<p><b>The president, a seasoned educator,met with faculty from<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>the College and University, chamber of commerce, Director of Apprenticehsip, Assessment Centre and NGOs in the training field. To see what if anything could be done</b></p>
<p><b>It appears that Holland college can provide the service required</b></p>
<p><b>Other issues ongoing</b></p>
