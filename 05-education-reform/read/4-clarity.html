  4  Clarity
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">This policy document (dated June 1, 2022) argues that education reform should be reframed as a plea for clarity. Don proposes establishing a PEI lexicon to address terminology inconsistencies in education literature. He distinguishes between education (a service with multiple functions) and schooling (institutional delivery). Emphasizes that vision statements must move beyond general philosophy to provide specific direction and measurable goals. Notes that services should be available to all citizens, not just those in formal school settings. This document reflects Don&#x27;s belief that clear definitions and communication are foundational to meaningful educational reform.</div>

<p align="center" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 108%"><b>CONCEPTUAL
CLARITY</b></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 108%"><b>The
literature speaks of the need for educational reform; I suggest that
we ee it as a plea for clarity.  it’s  time for a new focus on  the
teaching- task, a clarification and realignment of the focus and
framework  that engages us.  It’s a recognition that the task is
changing and so must our approach in supporting it. Here is my take
on the matter:</b></p>
<ol>
	<li><p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0in"><b>Terminology
	– </b>The
	education literature needs to be read carefully. No word has a
	simple meaning; every word seems to have multiple meanings or, at
	least multiple shadings of the same meaning.  In an endeavour as
	large and complex as education, It is likely that shades of meanings
	exist. A PEI lexicon would be very helpful.</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0in"><b>Education
	services</b><b>
	- </b> Education is a
	service; typical ducation functions or services include:
	information, counselling, instruction, products and technology,
	quality assurance. governance, funding and human resources. Learners
	may need one or all  services at any point in their education
	journey.  Services need to  be clearly identified and available to
	all Island citizens not just to citizens enrolled in schools and
	programs.  How services are organized and paid for is a separate
	issue..</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0in"><b>Education
	versus Schooling</b>
	– The World Bank, the largest funder of public education,
	cautioned Ministries of Education about treating “education and
	going to school” as though they are one and the same. I also
	encounter this view in my conversations and in the PEI education
	literature. A school, like a hospital is only a resource- rich
	location; education results from experiences gained while there. 
	</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0in"><b>A
	Vision </b>is a
	public statement of an organization’s purposes. ideals, core
	values and long-term objective and goals; a vision statement usually
	also lays out beliefs and guiding principles. Although PEI has
	statements of philosophy and goals, they lack sufficient detail to
	set direction or measure progress. 
	</p></li>
