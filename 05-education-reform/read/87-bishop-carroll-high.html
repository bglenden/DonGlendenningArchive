  87 Bishop Carroll High
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Don reflects on early visit to Bishop Carroll High School in Calgary with Dr. Tom Hall as part of the Canadian Restructured School Plan national study. Recently revisiting the school&#x27;s website, he finds their approach emphasizing &quot;unique, personalized, self-directed learning environment&quot; where students design customized programs with teacher-advisor guidance. Students progress at individual paces while meeting Alberta Education curriculum requirements. Don praises this clarity of purpose, finding it exemplary and aligned with his previous observations. Notably, Don criticizes PEI for lacking similar clear articulation of educational philosophy and vision. Suggests developing such statements would provide excellent professional development and replace outdated philosophy. Demonstrates Don&#x27;s ongoing research into exemplary school models and his conviction that clear mission statements drive educational effectiveness.</div>

<p>Bishop Carrol High School</p>
<p>Many years ago, Dr. Tom Hall and I visited Bishop Carroll High School in Calgary, Alberta; we were gathering information as part of a national study (Canadian Restructured School Plan) and Bishop Carrol was considered one of the innovative schools of the day.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Copies of the report should be available in our Provincial Library system.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Recently, as part of my ongoing exploration of education, I visited the Bishop Carroll website and found the following description of how they view themselves:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>“What sets Bishop Carroll apart from othe<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>high schools is<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>our unique, personalized, self-directed learning environment, which puts students in the driver’s seat of their educational journey. Here, students have the freedom to customize a learning program they feel is best suited for their unique goals, abilities and interests. With the guidance of a Teacher Advisor and their parents, the student will choose the program and courses they want to follow. Students can then progress through these courses at a personalized rate reflecting their individual needs and learning pace. Although students study at their own pace, they must still follow the curriculum set out by Alberta Education and must fulfill the requirements mandated by the province to receive their Alberta High School Diploma.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The main advantage of self-directed learning is that it empowers the student to take more responsibility and interest in decisions that will affect their education. Students will graduate from Bishop Carroll feeling a unique sense of ownership in their diploma and having had ‘hands-on’ control of their learning.”</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Obviously, I liked what I saw and found it informative, interesting and in keeping with my recollections of our visit.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>While I cannot tell from the statement how well the school is performing, their objectives are clear. Such a statement is lacking in PEI. Creating such a statement would be a great professional development activity and could replace the now outdated philosophy.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
