He argues that separating the Department of Education from other learning institutions creates silos and lacks shared vision, ultimately disadvantaging students.</div>

<p>September 5, 2015</p>

<p>Editor,</p>
<p>Charlottetown Guardian</p>
<p>Charlottetown, PEI	</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Dear Sir:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><b>Leaderless by design</b><b></b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>Unfortunately, PEI does not have a Department of Education; instead, we have a Department of Public Instruction.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The Minister of Education’s role is limited to running schools for youngsters. Colleges and universities are run by Boards of Governors, “continuing education” falls to the Minister of Workforce Development and Higher Learning, a few private schools and organizations offer special programs; if anyone has an overall responsibility for education it has to be our Premier.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Another reason for this line of thinking results from the role assigned to teachers.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Curriculum is developed in the Holman Building in Summerside and delivered in schools throughout the Province; teachers are expected to “deliver the outcomes”; in my books, that’s instruction not teaching.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>As a result, education id not seen as a continuum, lack of shared vision, operate in silos, experience little joint planning; fail to provide the support students needed. It is time for a unified education plan, if not a Department, and to professionalize teaching the teaching function.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Frankly, I think that we are being very unfair, especially to our young people.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Don Glendenning</p>
<p>A long-time student of education</p>
<p><br></p>
