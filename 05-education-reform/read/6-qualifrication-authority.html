  6 Qualifrication authority
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Distinguishing education from schooling, Glendenning argues school transcripts inadequately capture learners&#x27; practical capabilities—communication, teamwork, problem-solving, technical skills. He proposes an independent regional qualification authority (separate from teaching institutions) to assess actual educational outcomes, preventing conflicts of interest inherent in schools certifying their own students. He references the New Zealand Qualification Authority model and proposes an Atlantic Qualification Authority headquartered in PEI, supporting self-directed learning while providing third-party validation of competence. This represents a sophisticated credential-reform proposal.</div>

<p>Dear Editor:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>An independent qualification authority</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>It is a given that we need to improve the quality of education and encourage more people to participate at the</p>
<p>postsecondary level. More money will be required but other changes may also be useful.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>We speak and act as though education and schooling are the same; they're not. Degrees and diplomas reflect</p>
<p>schooling but say little about education. Schools emphasize and report on the acquisition of knowledge whereas</p>
<p>education is concerned with the application of knowledge - that is, what one can do with what one knows.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>School transcripts are useful but even more useful, I believe, would be information on the nature and level of the</p>
<p>beare/s education such as the ability to communicate with others, to work as a member of a team, to plan and solve</p>
<p>problems and, of course, to perform technical and professional skills. ldeally, this assessment should be available</p>
<p>from a third party. I am always suspicious of certification by a body that also provides the instruction; in my view,</p>
<p>the functions are different and should be dealt with separately to avoid conflict. lt is true that we already have</p>
<p>certification bodies that license or certifu people, however, my view is that certification bodies give too much weight</p>
<p>to success in school and not enough to experience.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The time has come for a free-standing qualification authority, perhaps even one to serve the Atlantic Region, to</p>
<p>address the issue of qualifications. We could learn from The New Zealand Qualification Authority but we should not</p>
<p>simply copy it. As a pilot for the concept, let me propose an Atlantic Qualification Authority located on Prince</p>
<p>Edward Island.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>ln addition to providing consistent third-pafi information, a separate qualification authority would provide much</p>
<p>needed support for self-directed study.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
<p><br></p>
