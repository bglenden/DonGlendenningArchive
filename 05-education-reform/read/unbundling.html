  Unbundling
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Don&#x27;s most ambitious structural proposal argues that government should &quot;unbundle&quot; education services, withdrawing from operating schools while retaining its planning, policy, standards, and funding roles. He compares education unfavorably to health and justice sectors where government funds but doesn&#x27;t employ practitioners, and identifies three organizational weaknesses: scripted curricula limiting teacher judgment, absence of independent advocates for students, and monopoly provision with no consumer choice. This letter represents Don&#x27;s most radical proposal for systemic transformation.</div>

<p>Dear Sir:</p>
<p><b>Unbundling Education</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Over the past few months, I’ve been party to a number of public discussions as well as private conversations about education.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Three things became clear:</p>
<p>There is widespread support for change</p>
<p>There is substantial agreement as to the nature of desired changes</p>
<p>Most of the issues are school issues rather than education issues</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>It naturally follows to wonder why the desired changes are not taking place, or perhaps they are but we are not hearing about them.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>So I looked at Health and Justice, two other large Departments heavily involved delivering “social services”, and found some significant differences in the way the sectors are organized.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Here are three:</p>
<p>Teachers follow a scripted curriculum in that most of the decisions about what will be taught, by whom, how, when and where are handed down to teachers, leaving comparatively little opportunity for teachers to customize service based on student need; other departments leave some decision-making to front-line professionals.</p>
<p>Absence of advocates – patients and families have doctors to provide independent information and guidance about health matters; this service is lacking in education.</p>
<p>Lack of choice – government is the single source provider of most education services; not only is it the major funder, but most of the people who deliver educational services are also on the government payroll; not so in the other departments</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>It is my view that education is unlikely to improve until government unbundles education services; it should get out of running schools and, instead, focus its attention on education -<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>planning, policy, standards, qualifications and funding.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
