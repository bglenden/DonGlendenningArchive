  9 Change 
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Responding to John Eldon Green&#x27;s column suggesting systemic school change is impossible, Glendenning disagrees, acknowledging real barriers but asserting that change is achievable with strong leadership, clear vision, and commitment. He references scholarly articles on education reform and notes that most teachers would welcome opportunities to teach differently if the system permitted. He advocates for PEI to become a leader in school improvement, developing systems that address documented concerns about current practices. The tone combines idealism with pragmatic recognition of implementation challenges.</div>

<p>Dear Editor:</p>
<p>Change</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I enjoyed the recent guest opinion on education by John Eldon Green and the follow-up comments. I</p>
<p>agree with much of what he wrote. Readers may be interested in a couple of articles which support his</p>
<p>views (Higher Education: The Albatross Around the Neck of our Public Schools by Evans Clinchy in the</p>
<p>Phi Delta Kappan, June L994 and Unemployment Training: An</p>
<p>ldeology of Non-work Learned in Urban Schools by Martin Haberman in the Phi Delta Kappan,</p>
<p>March L997.1</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>While teachers bear the brunt of the blame, many if not most teachers would be glad to teach</p>
<p>differently, if given the opportunity. The education system, however, allows little opportunity for</p>
<p>teachers to exercise their professional judgement about meeting the needs of individual learners.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I disagree most strenuously, however, with Mr. Green's view that the "school system itself cannot be</p>
<p>changed, in any significant way". The hurdles, if not barriers, are real and formidable.</p>
<p>Bringing about the desired changes will require strong leadership, a clear vision of who schools are for</p>
<p>and what they should do for each student, a high level of energy, and commitment on the part of school</p>
<p>leaders.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Prince Edward lsland could be a leader in school improvement; we could develop an education system</p>
<p>which addresses all of Mr. Green's concerns, and others. Much is known about how to improve our</p>
<p>schools. The question is "Do we have the will to make the required changes?"</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Don Glendenning</p>
