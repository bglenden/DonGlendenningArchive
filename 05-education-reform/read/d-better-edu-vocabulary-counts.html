<div class="reader-summary">This appears to be a duplicate version of the July 9 governance letter with the title &quot;Better Education: Starts in the Home&quot; but actual content identical to the governance/diversity letter. The filename suggests a focus on vocabulary, but the body addresses governance models and institutional design. This duplicate reflects Don&#x27;s document management practices during the drafting process.</div>

<p>Dear Sir:</p>
<p><b>Better Education: Starts in the Home</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>I am an advocate of change in the way we deliver education and, therefore, welcome the Minister’s announcement that a review of school governance is planned.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Needs are diverse and the delivery system should encourage, and be able to accommodate, a variety of providers. <span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Government’s role is to provide leadership, standards and resources – and then get out of the way.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The Province of Alberta appears to include the greatest range of diversity within its school system, and Alberta learners consistently garner high test results.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Is there a connection? I don’t know. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The number of administrative units, whether one or five, will in itself do little to improve the quality of education. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>What school boards need is greater freedom and accountability; the same could be said for teachers.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My scan of delivery systems includes the following:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Private schools<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></p>
<p>Teacher led schools such as Palmer Park in Detroit, MSLA in Denver, Colorado, or similar arrangements in Milwaukee, Minnesota, Boston and elsewhere.</p>
<p>Charter school – alberta has, I believe, a dozen.</p>
<p>The Edmonton Model although details are not clear to me at this time</p>
<p>A Crown corporation may give a government the control it wants and education the freedom it requires</p>
<p>Creating a model unique<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>to PEI<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>In 1969, the College Planning Committee opted for a Board of Governors; it appears to have worked.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Forty years later I am convinced that Holland College would have been quite a different institution had the College Planning Committee chosen, instead, to follow the governance model in place in sister provinces.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>So, why not consider the College model for our public schools? <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The cause is important, a review is timely, and there is considerable support for change from both within the system and the community at large. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It’s time to think outside the box.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Feel free to write me at<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>HYPERLINK "mailto:standards2020@gmail.com" <span>standards2020@gmail.com</span>.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
