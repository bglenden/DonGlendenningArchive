  D Depoliticize Education  
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">This is essentially the same argument as File 18 (July 27, 2015), with minor wording variations. Don reiterates that provincial governments control all aspects of education, creating a political system incapable of self-regulation. He emphasizes that trustees, principals, and teachers lack control over important decisions, all made by government employees under government regulations. He argues this eliminates checks and balances that ensure quality in other sectors and calls for government to delegate meaningful decision-making authority. The repetition of this core message in multiple letters over time demonstrates Don&#x27;s conviction about this fundamental systemic problem and his belief that emphasizing it through multiple published pieces could drive policy change.</div>

<p>Editor,</p>

<p>Charlottetown, PEI	</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Dear Sir:</p>
<p><b>Depoliticize education</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>Since provincial governments run schools in Canada, provincial governments alone must take responsibility for school results.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Government holds all the cards, licenses teachers, appoints trustees,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>builds schools, develops curriculum, sets standards, measures student achievement, limits competition, provides instruction, and assigns grades; in spite of comments to the contrary, trustees, principals and teachers have little control over the things that count; practically all important decision about a student are made by a government employee under regulations and conditions that government establishes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The degree to which government controls education far exceeds government control in any other sector.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>As a result, government has lost its ability to regulate the sector; criticism of what is happening is a criticism of government itself and, because governing is a political act, educations quickly become both political and controversial.<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>A myriad of regulations, formulae and “Ministerial directives” limit the ability of teachers to help students learn the attitude, skills and knowledge needed to become the citizens we want.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The system has lost the normal checks and balances that bring quality to a product or service.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>It doesn’t have to be this way but until government delegates meaningful decision making authority to school boards, schools and teachers, we can expect little improvement.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p><br></p>
