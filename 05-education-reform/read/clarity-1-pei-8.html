<div class="reader-summary">Draft notes titled &quot;Glendenning Notes&quot; and &quot;Clarity PEI -1&quot; exploring education terminology. Don discusses the World Bank&#x27;s warning about confusing schooling with education, critiques lack of transparency in public education discourse, and notes departmental focus on running schools rather than providing education services. Suggests establishment of a PEI Education Association. Contains references to World Bank, OECD Education 2030, and Montreal Economic Institute materials.</div>

<p>About Education</p>
<p>Glendenning Notes</p>
<p><b>Clarity PEI -1</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>The World Bank was correct; it warned developing countries about confusing going to school with getting an education. We may be doing that too. While schools, colleges and universities are important contributors, one’s education includes learning of all kinds, in all places, at all times and not just when one is in school.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>My third point is a call for transparency.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Public educators are not comfortable talking about education. Although I’ve encountered the “fear factor” on a number of occasions I still do not understand it. A friend in another Province attributes it to MLA interference; a different source suggested at it reflected alack of condidence.</p>
<p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Lack of clarity also distorts the education structure in that the Department is focused on running schools rather than providing education services.</p>

<p>An overhaul is called for. I suggest that keep is simple and do it ourselves. How about a taxonomy of everyday education terms? Then we could sharpen purpose and beliefs and perhaps even develop an education system. But I’ll stop here. For those interested, let me recommend</p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li1">The Crisis in Education by the World Bank</li>
  <li class="li1">Education 2030 by the OECD, and</li>
  <li class="li1">by the Montreal Economic Institute, and</li>
  <li class="li1">PISA</li>
</ul>
<p>I also suggest the establishment of a PEI Education Association, open to any and all Islanders, wih a focus on education offerings rather than the facility that hosts them</p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
<p>Don Glendenning</p>
<p>Some time ago I decided to explore public “chatter” about public education.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I did so because I believe education to be important and feel a responsibility to contribute to its continued success. As part of the process, I’ve talked with anyone who would spare me the time, read widely and cogitated on all. I also scanned websites of all kinds - Department, school. College, university, CMEC, CEA, CAMET, education organizations and many others.</p>
