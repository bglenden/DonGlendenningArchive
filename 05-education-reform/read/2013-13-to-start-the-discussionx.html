<div class="reader-summary">Synthesizing concerns about reading proficiency as a foundational community problem, Don reframes reading as a learnable, teachable, measurable skill accessible to most with support. Success requires information, instruction, materials, and practice alongside readiness, encouragement, and feedback. Don advocates recognizing early childhood&#x27;s unique developmental needs rather than extending school models downward, giving early learning equivalent status to colleges and universities. He proposes replacing traditional graduation requirements with a single reading proficiency standard; students achieving it receive diplomas and pursue interests. Referencing a school with differentiated language arts and math placement enabling flexible progression without grade repetition, Don envisions systems prioritizing readiness over batch processing.</div>

<p>Dear Sir:</p>
<p><b>A place to start</b></p>
<p>I believe that reading is important and I know from conversations with Islanders that others feel the same way.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In PEI, for instance, I’m told that the reading skills of 30,000 Islanders are so limited that they cannot deal with most printed material, 80% of seniors cannot read well enough to deal with everyday tasks and that, while literacy numbers are improving, literacy rates are not.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In talking with employers, they frequently refer to low level of reading and writing skills among recent graduates. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>So, reading is a problem, a community problem not just a school problem.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I also happen to believe that reading is a skill, it can be learned, it can be taught, it can be measured and, if given a bit of help, most people can reach the level needed for everyday tasks. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>What kind of help, you ask - information, instruction, resource materials and practice; they also need readiness, encouragement and feedback.<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Much of the readiness occurs long before children reach school; although it impacts on the work of schools, it is not a school problem.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Instead of migrating the school model downward, let’s recognize and support the uniqueness of early childhood and give early childhood development the same kind of freedom and status that we give colleges and universities.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Perhaps we should also toss out the current graduation requirements and replace them with something new, a required level of reading; every student who reaches the required level of reading would be granted a graduation diploma.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>With a diploma in hand, students should be free to pursue other courses of interest. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>I once visited a school where the first period every morning was devoted to language arts; each student fitted into a class that met his or her needs.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>At 10:00 am students moved to a math course at the level they needed, and at 11:00 the same arrangement applied to science.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Student received the help they needed, there was no getting behind, no repeating of grades and each student moved to the next module or level when ready; afternoons were scheduled in the traditional way.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It seems to me that such a model would much greater flexibility than our current organization.</p>
<p>I am sure that there are other ideas out there waiting to see the light of day; simply add them to the list and send me a copy at<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>HYPERLINK "mailto:standards2020@gmail.com" <span>standards2020@gmail.com</span><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
