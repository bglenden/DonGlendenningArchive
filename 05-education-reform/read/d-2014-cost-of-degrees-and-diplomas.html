  D 2014 cost of degrees and diplomas
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Don questions whether expensive diploma ceremonies represent genuine educational value or primarily serve as rites of passage with declining value. He argues that transcripts adequately convey educational achievement without ceremonial framing, and that structural problems in education delivery—particularly content delivery to captive audiences—have created unsustainable cost structures. He identifies the &quot;cost disease&quot; as affecting education like healthcare, with overhead consuming resources while qualified staff shortages emerge for complex cases. Don proposes business model transformation from content delivery to learner development.</div>

<p>Dear Sir:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Cost of a degree or diploma</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>The awarding of diplomas and degrees is an expensive rite of passage; I’m wondering if the cost is worth it</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I’ve often wonder how much it costs to award a diploma or degree; that is the cost over and above the cost of simply providing a transcript.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I’m talking about the cost of the framed parchment handed out handed out during an official graduation ceremony and not thebycoursesthere is add to Did you ever what the cost of<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>a framed degree or diploma adds to the cost of education</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Diplomas and degrees are part of a rite of passage</p>
<p>Nothing to do with education</p>
<p>Are declining in value</p>
<p>Promotional tool</p>
<p>May even interfere with getting an education</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Transcript tell something about education</p>
<p>Maintain their value</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>egree There is a structural problem with the way we deliver educational services; Historically, and to a large extent<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>still today, schools are organized to deliver predetermined content over extended periods of time to a captive market. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>While education does have a number of unique features, information technology has<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Overhead costs are swamping the system</p>
<p>Cannot afford the current model</p>
<p>Relatively routine educational tasks are being delivered by over qualified staff</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>System lacks highly qualified staff to deal with more challenging cases</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Different business models may be required</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Unloikely that the current model can be rejigged</p>
<p>Universities ae not yet producing teachers for the emerging model</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The market place is changing, costs have skyrocketed, quality has<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>not improved and in fact, some would argue it has declined. The cost disease (AIMS 0 has struck, bureaucracy has grown,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>without an earket Several times recently mention has been made of the structuralAIMS the costs disease</p>
<p>Schools need a different business model.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Current model cannot be sustained – will bankrupt us</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Switch from content delivery to development</p>
<p>Schools, colleges are businesses; they have a mission, to provide instruction to students, resources in the form of people and building; has established criteria and procedures for delivering its services, and while it does not make a profit, it certainly has revenue. Let me hasten to add that I am not suggesting that the public achools be run by business nor that the purpose of schools is primarily to prepare students for employment.</p>

<p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>esses.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I beg to differ.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>While business is not my field of study, I am of the view that public sector organizations, including schools, colleges and universities are businesses and, in fact, have, or should have,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>business plans which are updated from time to time.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>According to Forbes, there are four components of business models in the sector:</p>
<p><b>- Value - </b>what is offered to individuals<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>or the community</p>
<p><b>- Resources – </b>that an organization assembles</p>
<p><span class="Apple-converted-space">          </span>to provide that service</p>
<p><b>- Processes – </b>that the organization goes through</p>
<p><span class="Apple-converted-space">                        </span>to deliver its services, and</p>
<p><b>- Revenue - </b>gathered in support of its work.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Of the four, I believe that the first and third, what is offered and the manner in which it is delivered is out of synch with the times.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>II say this because out province, and most provinves have made great strides in gathering quality resources and in providing revenue; values and processes are relatively unchanged<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Gains have not been commensurate with the increases. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
