  D A different erspective
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">This reflective piece explores a fundamental shift in education&#x27;s role throughout the past century. Don contrasts historical education (providing answers for industrialized economy) with contemporary needs (developing questioners for knowledge economy). He notes the paradox that while grandfathers once found questioning threatening, today&#x27;s knowledge workers must be questioners—yet modern education often views them as threatening. The piece invites continued dialogue with readers who share these observations, demonstrating Don&#x27;s commitment to intellectual discourse and his recognition of education&#x27;s evolving purpose in society.</div>

<div class="reader-content">
<p>A different perspetive</p>
<p>Some time go, one of my readers pointed out an interesting switch in the role of education over our lifetime.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He pointed out how the role of education changed from that of providing the answer to that of defining the question.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Presumably the change results, at least in part, from the vast storehouse<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>of information available at out fingertips.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That certainly applies to the cognitive domain but how about the support for affective and psychomotor domains?<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></p>
<p>I was also struck by his comment that our grandfathers wanted their offspring to have a lifetime of work in the industrialized economy, and how the workplace of the day found questions and questioners<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“threatening and irritating”.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It seems that the reverse is true today, fathers and grandfathers want their children to have a lifetime of work<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>in the knowledge industry, a work place that wants people who are<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>questioners and questioning.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It’s education that finds questioners “threatening and irritating.</p>
<p>If by chance my respondent reds this letter, I would be delighted to resume the conversation.</p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
<p>Don Glendenning</p>
<p>A long time student of education</p>
