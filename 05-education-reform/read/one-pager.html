Concern about reading is
widespread and frequently surfaces in conversations about education. 
Articles on low performance levels appear frequently in national and
local media.  The media also reports initiatives aimed at improvement
of reading, yet performance levels remain unacceptedly low and have
improved little if any during the past decade.  For the purpose of
this paper, and as our working definition,  we’ve defined reading
as a
set of skills that enable a person to turn printed information into
meaning and achieve the goals of independence, comprehension and
fluency.</p>

It is our view that reading
levels can be improved in a variety of ways including more and better
information and instruction, wider us of self- instructional
materials, recognition and engagement, assessment and feedback.
  It is also our view
that reading is a community problem and one that cannot be solved by
schools and educators alone.

Step one in bringing about
change is to develop a clear and measureable set of reading
competencies; that is a check list that can be given to students, new
Canadians, employers and parents, and of course to teachers, anyone
and everyone who is interested in raising the levels of the reading
skills of Islanders; such a list does not exist at the moment. 
That’s where we plan to start.  We will do so by convening a small
working group of parents, employers, teachers, and others and, with
the help of experienced analysts, develop a generic list, we call it
reading skills for citizens, and we’ll make it available to people
through our website.</p>
