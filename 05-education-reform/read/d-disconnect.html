  D Disconnect 
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Don identifies what he calls &quot;the great disconnect&quot; in education—the disconnect between outcomes-based education theory and actual school practice. He notes that while extensive educational outcomes are published, report cards don&#x27;t reflect performance on individual outcomes. Teachers cannot realistically assess and report on every outcome, creating a gap between stated educational philosophy and institutional practice. This letter reflects his attention to practical implementation challenges and the importance of alignment between policy rhetoric and classroom reality.</div>

<p>Dear Sir:</p>
<p><b>The great disconnect</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>We spend a great deal of money in developing outcomes for all subjects and for all grades; lists of outcomes are easy to find on the website of the Department of Education and Early Childhood Development.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Anyone interested in what their child or grandchild is learning should take a look.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And if your child is having a problem with a subject, you should make a copy and take it with you to the next meeting with your child’s teacher.</p>
<p>In Outcomes Based Education, outcomes are, or should be, the basis for developing curriculum, organizing teaching activities, tracking students and assessing progress.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>While teachers cannot teach each outcome separately, they certainly can and should report progress on each outcome.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The report cards I’ve seen, do not report that way. Otherwise, And I’m not sure that postsecondary institutions and HR Departments could handle it if they did.</p>
<p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>- and that’s the great disconnect in education.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p><br></p>
