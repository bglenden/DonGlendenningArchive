</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Don questions the language of educational failure, noting that we don&#x27;t label people as failures in other life contexts—religion, medicine, or mortality. He distinguishes between education (skill and attitude development) and schooling (knowledge acquisition), arguing schools focus too narrowly on the latter. He critiques the importance society places on credentials while ignoring broader educational outcomes. The letter invites public engagement on reading improvement and suggests that how we frame success and failure significantly impacts educational outcomes. It challenges the deficit-based language prevalent in educational discourse.</div>

<p>Dear Sir</p>
<p><b>Can one fail a year and still get an education?</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>I seems strange to me that the term “failure” is so widely used in education.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Students fail a course, fail a grade or fail a year. We don’t label a person a failure if they drop out of church; neither do we label a patient a failure if they take longer than expected to recover; in fact, a person is not considered a failure even if they die.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Learning, hopefully broadens our knowledge, increases our skills and changes our attitudes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Schools focus on the broadening of knowledge, while education outside school, it seems to me, focuses more on skills and attitudes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Success in school is deemed to be so important that society demands that it be formally recognized by the granting of a “folded paper, more commonly known as a diploma.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Now, I believe in the value of both education and schooling.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Please do your part and enter the debate; it is a vital step towards reading Improvement and your comments are welcome at standards2020@gmail.com. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
