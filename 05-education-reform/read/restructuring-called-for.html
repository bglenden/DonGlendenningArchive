  Restructuring Called For
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Letter documenting multiple structural confusions in PEI education. Don notes: (1) the Department claims to offer &quot;schooling&quot; only, despite &quot;education&quot; being in its title; (2) the Department is organized by schooling levels rather than functions; (3) the Department&#x27;s stated role omits &quot;helping learners&quot;; (4) common terminology is lacking; (5) PEI has a &quot;school system&quot; rather than an &quot;education system.&quot; He calls for review and upgrade based on education literature.</div>

<p><span>					</span><b>Restructuring Called For</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>I’ve been talking with friends about education; a few things confuse me. There have been a number of staff changes recently at senior levels of the Department; lack of clarity may have been the cause.</b></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li3"><b>Although called a Department of Education, we seem only to offer “schooling” to young people; on enquiry, I was told that “education” was dropped from the Education Act a few years ago.</b></li>
  <li class="li3"><b>Government departments are usually organized around major functions; our Department of Education seems tu is organized around “levels of schooling”.</b></li>
  <li class="li3"><b>The Role of the Department is given as “developing and delivering curriculum”; it seems strange that the idea of “helping” learners has been left out.</b></li>
  <li class="li3"><b>Given the importance of education, the number of people involved, the size and diversity of the education community, and<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>the complexity of the field,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>the development and distribution of a list of key words would be helpful.</b></li>
  <li class="li3"><b>The education literature calls for an education system; we seem only to have a school system.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Th literature reports on a variety of changes in education occuring elsewhere. perhaps its time for an upgrade in PEI.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b>Sincerely</b></p>
