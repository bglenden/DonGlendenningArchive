  2015 An opening salvo
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">This more ambitious draft addresses the coming election and education&#x27;s place in public discourse. Don argues that government conflates setting rules with running schools, creating inflexibility, reduced innovation, and politicization of professional issues. He outlines options: an independent education board or government delegation of operations while retaining oversight. The document is notably fragmented and shows significant revision, suggesting Don was wrestling with comprehensive education system reform during election season. He emphasizes that consensus exists on needed changes but implementation remains blocked.</div>

<p>Dear Sir:</p>
<p><b>Changing dynamics<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></b></p>

<p>A new year brings new opportunities.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>An election year adds to the hope that maybe, just maybe, education will move higher on the public agenda.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And if we are really lucky, perhaps a new government will remove some the inflexibilities that only it can change. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Everybody needs education, which I define as developing a base of knowledge, skills<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>and attitudes that are good for the individual and the community;</p>
<p>Government has a major role in ensuring that a quality education is available to all its citizens.</p>
<p>Problem is that government thinks it should<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>both set the rules and run the schools</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>What’s missing is responsiveness, innovation, freedon to act, accountability, choice, communication, relevance</p>

<p>Government retain the oversight function and delegate operating</p>

<p><br></p>
<p>We are at the beginning of a new year2015 Debate about education is alive and well; educators and the public are talking about improving our education system; many are talking the same language but the problem is they are not talking with each other. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>An election in the offing provides new opportunities influence direction and that is especially so in that</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Since any significant change requires to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p><br></p>

<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>There is considerable consensus about the changes that are required; what people do not understand is why they are not happe<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>ning.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Islanders believe that PEI is a natural place to model a future oriented education model – and I agree.</p>
<p>While there is room for all of us to do both more and better, the changes required demand significant level of leadership from our elected representatives.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The current leadership campaigns and upcoming elections provide an excellent opportunity to make our views known and seek commitments fro aspiring politicians.</p>
<p>There are many places to initiater change including establishing a clear vision, focusing on learner needs, filling some of the obvious gaps in the sercice, greater communication between educatiors and the public they serve.organizing dservic</p>
<p>Problems not getting resolved are the administrstive organizational ones<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Like a church session and trusteed<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>need to remove barriers</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Education is the most significant issue of the day; Better education improves our economy, health, environment stc</p>
<p>It’s a new year and one with new possibilities for improving education</p>
