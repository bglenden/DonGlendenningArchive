Don examines assessment functions (criticism, evaluation, ranking), labor mobility issues, and proposes an independent qualification authority (AQUA) to eliminate teacher-sorting conflicts and support lifelong learning, positioning it as central to educational system reform.</div>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Education
is a lifelong process of gaining experiences that have a formative
effect on the way we feel, think and act; it is a process of changing
attitudes, skills and knowledge.  Education is a key factor in
determining one’s quality of life; in the same way, the collective
education of our citizens will determine to a significant degree the
future quality of our community and country. Because of the
importance of education, our country and community have invested
heavily in a variety of educational support services including
schools colleges and universities and that workforce must be mobile
to ensure a well-functioning economy.

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">More
recently, in the last two decades, as the demand for, and awareness
of the importance of higher education has accelerated, the attention
of policy makers has expanded to include a more careful examination
of the type and quality of post-secondary education, and in some
jurisdictions, specific policies have been adopted to encourage
changes intended to create a better match between post-secondary
education and the changing labour market.

<b>Transcript</b>s,
I am told, were first issued by teachers at the request of students
and provided to students information about what had been studied to
carry with them when they returned to their home community or to
another country.  Educational institutions today issue an official
document detailing the courses taken together with dates, course
names, credit hours, grades received and perhaps number in the class
and student ranking.

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">The
idea behind this proposal is to establish an independent body with
authority to assess and certify a person’s level of performance on
a task or set of tasks such as found in an occupation or field.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">A
qualification authority would reduce if not eliminate the confusion
faced by teachers between teaching and sorting, focus certification
more clearly on performance that matters, support lifelong learning
and self-directed study, clearly focus school evaluation on helping
learners learn, and reduce major for distractions for teachers caused
by operating the sorting process.  It would, in effect, have two
clients, the organizations desiring an assessment service and
individuals wanting to confirm thelevel and suitability of their
qualifications.  A qualification authority would take its cues from
the destination of the learner, focus on what a client can do and how
well, examine each skills carried and assess their suitability  also
identify gaps for the individual would not simply administer .  A
qualification authority could also play a useful role in helping
people identify gaps in their preparation for a given field of work.
