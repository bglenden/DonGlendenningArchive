<p><b>Preparedness: an issue with youth</b></p>
<p>Some 35 people participated in a lively discussion recently on issues facing young people in PEI after they finish school. The subject arose from a recent survey conducted by the Community Foundation in which over one/third of the respondents expressed concern about a gap in their preparedness for further education or for work; the focus was on how to narrow the gap.</p>
<p>A long list of ideas emerged; time did not permit a detailed ranking but there certainly was a sense that action was needed not further study – a sense that let’s get on and do it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The very first comments was about the need for a clear statement about the role of schools in preparing people for work; comments about the gap arising from the round tables were wide-ranging and included mentorship, a sharper focus on skills of citizenship, and more support for young people seeking qualifications.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The surprising idea, coming independently from a number of tables, was the reference to courage, courage by young people to try new things, courage of educators to try new options, courage by the community to step forward in support of students and their learning.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Not only must we think outside the box, we must act outside the box as well.</p>
<p>The session began with a presentation by Steve McQuaid, VP of the Community Foundation of Prince Edward Island and Katherine MacDonald, Researcher; the survey itself included over 200 youth between the ages of 15 and 25, and dealt with youth concerns about health, education, employment and social issues. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The workshop organized by Education 20/20 and chaired by Don Glendenning.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Other workshops are being planned.</p>
<p>People interested in future activities of Education 20/20, or to be placed on the mailing list for the monthly newsletter, should send an email to pei@caneducation2020@.com</p>
