<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0.14in"><span lang="en-US">Dear</span></p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Our
future as individuals and as a community depends in large measure on
the quality of the education we make available to our citizens. To
call attention to concerns about the quality of our education system
and to harness the efforts of others with the same concerns, we
established an organization in 2012, Education
20/20 Inc., as an independent, broad based, national, not-for-profit
education organization, located in Charlottetown, PEI and governed
by a volunteer Board of Directors. Attached is a brochure describing
the organization, a list of <span lang="en-US">activities
undertaken during the past year as well as some notes about plans for
the coming months; what the list does not show is the dozens of
conversations with a diverse variety of backgrounds all on the
subject of education</span></p>
<p lang="en-US" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><br />

</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><span lang="en-US">We
are struck by the lack of information about education in the public
domain; think for a moment of the media coverage of health issues, of
Dr. Oz, Dr. Phil, Dr. xxx,  and the other specialists, the monthly
medical column in our local paper, local headlines about influenza,
mumps and ebola. And of the dozens of health organizations from
alzheimers to pain management undertaking activities in support of
improved health.   In education, it seems, we are limited to
repetitious coverage of educational problems but seldom any in depth
coverages of solutions..  While we realize that having information by
itself does not guarantee change, without independent information the
change is unlikely to survive – in other words information is the
fuel for change.</span></p>
<p lang="en-US" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0.14in"><br />
<br />

</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0.14in"><span lang="en-US">About
a year ago, we launched a newsletter for the purpose of (1) keeping
the education debate alive, (2) provoking thought, (3) identifying
relevant happenings elsewhere and (4) of course, keep the
organization in the public view.    At the moment we have a
circulation of 200 which we will try to double in the coming year. 
We are also taking steps to increase our presence in the social media
and launch a series of occasional papers.</span></p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0.14in"><span lang="en-US">With
Canadian aspirations, we believe it important to publish our
newsletter in both official languages.  (Copies of our two most
recent newsletters are enclosed)  For a short while, we were
fortunate to have the services of a professional translator as a
volunteer, however, that is no longer the case.  Our call for a
volunteer, approached the University of Moncton who operates a
training program for translators, and others solicitations were not
successful either.  I am pleased to report, however, that we now have
the services of a trained and experienced translator for $35.00 per
issue.</span></p>

letter comes as a request for financial assistance in  the amount of
$1,000 to cover the translation of our Newsletter for the next 2
years.</span></p>
