<p><b>Wallace and Margaret McCain Foundation</b></p>
<p><b>About Us</b></p>
<p><b>Vision</b><br>
<br>
A Canada where what we know about early child development benefits children, families and the further development of a democratic, pluralistic and prosperous society.<br>
<br>
<b>Mission</b><br>
<br>
To champion effective early childhood programs across Canada that provide equal opportunities for all children, align with the school system and operate within a provincial or territorial framework.<br>
<br>
<b>Objectives</b><br>
<br>
The Margaret and Wallace McCain Family Foundation invests in young children and their families with practice, policy and knowledge objectives.</p>
<p><b>Practice</b> In selected Atlantic Canada communities, transform existing public health, family support, child care and early education resources into effective integrated early childhood programs that provide opportunities for all young children and their families.</p>
<p><br>
Impact: Reduce the numbers of vulnerable children entering Grade One in demonstration communities.<br>
<br>
<b>Knowledge</b> Amplify efforts to put science into actions that benefit the lives of young children. Support efforts to gather, build and share evidence about early child development with the goal of informing and inspiring public discourse and policy action.<br>
<br>
Impact: Increase public and private investment in early child development.<br>
<br>
<b>Policy</b> Initiate a pan-Canadian alliance to promote policies for integrated provincial/territorial early childhood systems as an extension of public education. A Canadian policy alliance can provide a neutral, non-partisan forum for dialogue around early childhood issues among a politically diverse group of participants including elected officials, government staff, professional and sector organizations, parent groups and communities.<br>
<br>
Impact: Increase participation in effective early childhood programs</p>
