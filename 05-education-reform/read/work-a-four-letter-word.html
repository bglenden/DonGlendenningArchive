  Work A four-letter word
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">A revised version of the &quot;Work&quot; essay, presenting similar themes with enhanced clarity. Don emphasizes that while parents still believe schools should prepare students for work, educators have moved away from this objective. He notes the disconnect between school policy documentation and actual employment preparation, uses the term &quot;weasel words&quot; like &quot;career exploration&quot; and &quot;job shadowing&quot; to describe inadequate substitutes for genuine work readiness training. Don appeals to educators to examine their institution&#x27;s publications and engage school boards and government to reclaim preparing students for productive employment as an explicit educational objective. He expresses confidence that many educators share this view but feel disconnected from policy-making.</div>

<p><b>23 - A Four-letter Word</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>While I may not have an extensive vocabulary, I try to be reasonably careful about the words I use.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Sometimes I slip although, even then, I’m not prone to using words which slur a listener’s race, gender, religion or politics.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I’m also sensitive to the use of four letter words which, although common, may be offensive.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>On the other hand, I am very comfortable with some four-letter words which other educators seldom use.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The one which comes most quickly to mind is “work” – as in preparation for work.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is such a descriptive word, I am puzzled as to why we do not use it when talking about the role of schools.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Where I grew up, work was a perfectly acceptable topic of conversation.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As was the idea that going to school helped prepare you for work.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was understood at my home that those who completed high school, and for sure those who went yond high school, were likely to have work which was easier and paid better than those who did not.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The fact that some relative or friend “got a good job” was a mark of respect and carried to a certain degree of satisfaction -<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>especially if it applied to a family member.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>My recollection, also, is that<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>a student’s “going to work”- finding a job- was perfectly acceptable topic of a conversation among teachers or at least, between teachers and students. We knew as teachers, that all of our students would go to work at some point in their lives and that was one the major reasons why they had come to school.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Fellow students, when I was one, talked about work, looked forward to going to work, expected to go to work.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That was one of the main reasons for going to school.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This also applied to studies in college and university.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Parents still seem to think that schools should prepare people for work.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>At least they used to and the ones I talk to still do.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is educators who seem to be out of step.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>But the idea of schools helping people prepare for work seems to have faded from sight.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Schools now are bent on preparing students to go on to further education.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And preparing for further education and preparing for work are not the same thing.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Perhaps they should be but in practice they are not.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Over the past 7 years I have had opportunity to read considerable literature from schools and from Departments of education.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My reading suggests that, in the minds of the education officials, the connection between school and preparation for work is tenuous to say the least.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The references are to career exploration, job shadowing, transition, career awareness, contributor to society, etc.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They are weasley words.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They are not words which carry a high degree of accountability.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I realize that, in writing for the CVA Journal, I’m probably talking to the converted.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And there are many who do not read this journal who are converted also.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Their voices need to be heard,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>they appear not to be among the writers of school policy or decision-makers.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Do me a favor; prove me wrong.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Examine the publications which your school puts out.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Also examine bulletins from your Department or ministry.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Do they give a clear statement about the role of schools?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If they do, acknowledge it in a later column.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If it does not, and you think schools should perform this function, speak to your principal or a school board member., Deputy Minister, Minister or even your local member of the Legislative Assembly.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I hope that I hear from many readers and can be proven wrong.</p>
