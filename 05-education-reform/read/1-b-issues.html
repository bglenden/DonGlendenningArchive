<div class="reader-summary">Second draft editor letter providing Don&#x27;s analytical framework for education. Distinguishes learning as individual behavioral change, teaching as helping facilitate change, and education as the cumulative result of all formative experiences. Argues government&#x27;s role should be &quot;encouraging and supporting&quot; rather than direct operation; notes state must ensure skilled workforce for community sustainability. Lists systemic concerns: narrow role definition, lack of regulatory clarity, accountability measurement, and neglect of adult education—proposing comprehensive public conversation to establish education&#x27;s nature and services for the coming century.</div>

<div class="reader-content">
<p>Dear Editor:</p>
<p>Draft 2</p>
<p>Issues in Education</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>For some time now I have engaged with Islanders in conversations about education; topics included learners, learning, learning paths, continuing education, math, politicization, transition to employment, professional autonomy, accountability, and the list goes on. My conversations reveal a desire for information and dialogue, not just about school matters, but also about education and what we can do to make it better</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>At its simplest, learning refers to engaging in an activity intended to change the way one thinks, feels or acts; teaching, on the other hand, is a process helping others change the way they think, feel or act. One’s education, on the other hand,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>is the result of all the experiences that have altered the ways that a person thinks, feels or acts. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Of course, we also consider education as a sector of the economy.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Having an education or being educated may be thought of as a person’s stage of development; a person with a good education is better able to deal with circumstances that confront us throughout their lives than are people with a limited education. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>With regard to the education process, most would agree, I think, that the State has an important role in education that of<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“encouraging and supporting citizens in their quest for education”; the State also regulates the education sector.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I believe, however, that the state has another interest and that is to ensure that it has the skilled people to make our community a place residents<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>will continue to want to call home.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Education is a large and complex service; the literature suggests that education services include governance, instruction, information, counselling, funding, learning products, quality assurance, and human resources. yet the mission statement describes its role as “developing and delivering<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>high quality programs and curriculum.” <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>I<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>find ithe Government description of role to be a narrow role, indeed and wonder: <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li6">Shouldn’t all Islanders be encouraged to further their education?</li>
  <li class="li6">Doesn’t Government have a regulatory role?</li>
  <li class="li6">Who monitors<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>quality and equity?</li>
  <li class="li6">that PEI should be encouraging and supporting young people increase or improve their level.</li>
  <li class="li6"> Shouldn’t the Department encourage people over age 18 to continue their education</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span></p>
<p>I believe that it is time for a conversation<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>about education on PEI – not a study but an open exchange as to the nature and kind of services that will best serve our interests into the next centuryneeded and wanteby Islander in the n</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li6">Switch from education as a service to education as a product; from helping Islanders learn attitudes, skills, knowledge and values to one of delivering education products – lessons, courses, programs, diplomas and degrees.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li6">Relevance: desire for content reflects life roles of the 21<sup>st</sup>. century rather than traditional fields of study.</li>
  <li class="li6">Autonomy: education is a helping profession; practitioners need freedom to deliver services of a kind, in a mix and at a time that best suit needs of clients.</li>
  <li class="li6">Accountability: practitioners should be accountable for helping learners reach an objective and not just<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>for delivering a<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>service.</li>
  <li class="li6">Politicization: embedding education services in a political system increases the fear factor and interferes with the system’s ability to deliver services to clients.</li>
  <li class="li6">Confusing getting an education with going to school</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p>Islanders would appreciate and education would benefit from a public conversation about what education is trying to do – and why.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p><br></p>
