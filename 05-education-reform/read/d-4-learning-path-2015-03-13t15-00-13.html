<p><b><i>About education</i></b></p>
<p><b><i></i></b><br></p>
<p><b><i>Learning path			<span class="Apple-converted-space">     			</span></i></b></p>
<p>No. B-2				 					<span class="Apple-converted-space">                </span>November6, 2014</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The first step in understanding education is to understand learning and the learning process.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>So, what do we know about learning.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>First of all learning is an individual matter; only the learner can learn.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>To learn is to change behaviour; a person who has learned has new knowledge a new skill or a different attitude. Learning involves engaging in an experience that has a formative effect on a person.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>To better understand the learning process, Education 20/20 invited a panel of young people to tell how they went about learning and what support they found most helpful.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Key words were listed on a flip chart; the list was long, however, on further discussion the panel members settled on the following steps they took the learning path:</p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li6"></li>
  <li class="li6">Gather Information			</li>
  <li class="li6">Attend lecture				</li>
  <li class="li6">Seek counselling			</li>
  <li class="li6">Observe demonstration			</li>
  <li class="li6">Attempt task				</li>
  <li class="li6">Undergo assessment			</li>
  <li class="li6">Motivate self</li>
  <li class="li6">Observe others</li>
  <li class="li6">Use resource material</li>
  <li class="li6">Reflect on experience			</li>
  <li class="li6">Take diagnosis				</li>
  <li class="li6">Obtain feedback			</li>
  <li class="li6">Take instruction</li>
  <li class="li6">Self evaluate</li>
  <li class="li6">Coach others</li>
  <li class="li6">Practice</li>
  <li class="li6"></li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p>Next, students were asked the order in which they needed help; not surprisingly, students followed quite different paths.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As an example, one student said his first step would be to Google the topic; another said if it involved a new skill, he would probably attempt it first, while others liked the traditional lecture as a place to start.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Since panel members were in school or recent graduates, much of the discussion revolved around gaining new knowledge rather than skills or attitudes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Our<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>first chart was linear, however, it soon became evident that learning was anything but linear.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>It also became evident that different purposes for learning did not substantially change the help needed, although different purposes may make the path longer.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Although not part of the original discussion, we’ve added the manner of recognition likely to occur at the close of the learning cycle.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Consultation is ongoing, however, consider this as an interim progress report.</p>
