</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Community-based engagement initiative to improve education quality through stronger school-community connections. Identifies communication gaps between schools and communities revealed through Education 20/20 workshops. Proposes providing information, facilitating parent engagement sessions, teaching best practices, and supporting community groups. Pilot includes training facilitation cadre, organizing community discussions, and providing support to three communities. Philosophical discussion included about public engagement as grassroots democracy, referencing Kentucky&#x27;s engagement-centered reform, Birmingham University&#x27;s Professor of Public Engagement, and large-scale public participation models.

</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><span lang="en-US">It
is widely recognized that the level and quality of education is key
to our future as individuals, families, communities and countries.  
But this view is tempered with a concern that the education currently
available is not preparing, nor is it likely to prepare, our people
for the life that lies ahead.  As an example, for at least a decade
now The Conference Board of Canada has been urging greater emphasis
on the fundamental skills of literacy and numeracy, the skills of
self-management and the ability to work as a team member.  And yet,
literacy rates in PEI have not risen and we still find that 42
percent of our young adults lack the skills needed to function in a
modern economy.  </span>
</p>
<p lang="en-US" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><br />

</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><span lang="en-US">Some
people confuse education and schooling; this is unfortunate and
learners suffer as a result.  Many schools continue to operate on a
time based, subject centered, delivery model with little interaction
between learner and teacher or school and community.  The system must
change but it is unlikely that it will make the desired changes
without some outside help.   We say this based on the view that the
education enterprise lacks the usual market measures that ensure
change.  This need is becoming increasingly obvious. It is our view
that, both in PEI and elsewhere, that shortfall is increasingly
becoming recognized, brought on by a number of events including
international competition, on-line-delivery of courses, student
demand, large numbers of young people without sufficient basic
skills, declining postsecondary enrolments, funding shortages,
changing student demand and job skill requirements. To provide this
kind of education will require a system that is flexible, transparent
and , customized with  clearly identified standards</span></p>
<p lang="en-US" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><br />

</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><span lang="en-US">Change
is fuelled by Information, however, we know that having information
itself doesn’t guarantee change – but information certainly
supports it and must be accompanied by engagement of all concerned.
Providing relevant information is the focus of this proposal.</span></p>
<p lang="en-US" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><br />

</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><span lang="en-US">In
sectors other than education, there are community groups that play an
important role in providing relevant information to the public.  For
example, t</span><span lang="en-US">hink
of the information that we receive day in and day out about cancer,
diabetes, Alzheimers, the dangers of smoking as well as many other
matters relating to our health services.  Similar organizations do
not exist in education.  It is our view that information about
matters of education, such as early detection of reading problems,
helping with homework, standards or independent study would have a
significant impact on the education of our young people.</span></p>

<ul>
	<li><p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><b>Independent
	information:</b>  Most of our
	information about education comes from the people who operate the
	system; to address the shortage, we currently produce a monthly
	electronic newsletter; in addition, our website has also just gone
	live and we plan to use it as an information hub for surveys,
	announcements, occasional papers, social media, etc.<b>  </b>

<ul>
	<li><p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><b>Engagement</b>:
	 When families, schools and communities work together, student
	achievement improves.  For this reason, we are hosting a series of
	discussions throughout the Island focused on concerns of young
	people about gaps in their education.  The first workshop was held
	in the Stratford Town Hall on January 20, 2014; attendance was good
	and discussion was lively; it also went on long after the meeting
	closed.  The workshop is being repeated in Montague on February 18,
	Summerside on March 11 and Wellington on March 25; in addition,
	workshops are planned for Souris and O’Leary; and we are preparing
	for a second series, this one likely on educational quality.

<br />

</p>
<ul>
	<li><p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><b>Recognition
	and incentives</b>: The education sector lack incentives –
	students cannot finish early; there is little encouragement to
	innovate, principals have little autonomy to make local adjustments;
	each school is a cookie cutter of all other schools, and parents
	have little choice in choosing a school and none in choosing a
	teacher.  As a way to foster greater engagement, and thanks to a
	generous donor, Education 20/20 will soon announce an educational
	award for a school or learning centre that best demonstrates
	engagement in its everyday activities; other incentives will follow.</p></li>

<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">During
the past year, our cities witnessed a number of occupations; the
reasons may be obscure and open to interpretation but the unease
between governors and the governed, between citizens and
institutions, is evident.  Some would say that the two are estranged.
 
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0.14in"><br />
<br />

</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">During
the past few months, the writer has engage many Islanders in
discussions about education and here, also, exists a significant
divide between providers and users of educational services,
especially in the public school system.  And, while I have not read
widely on the subject, I find it to be of concern among governments
in other countries as well.  Even when decision makers seek the views
of others affected by their decision, those consulted feel that they
have been manipulated.</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0.14in"><br />
<br />

</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">But
people want more than simply being consulted, they want to engage in
the making of the decision.  The current term for this kind or level
of participation is “public engagement”.  It results in putting
more decision-making powers directly into the hands of ordinary
people – it is really grass roots democracy in action.  The key to
public engagement, I believe, is readily available unbiased
information, community conversations and participation in policy
development. Public engagement starts with the setting of the agenda,
working from shared information, a transparent agenda, and care to
insure inclusiveness, control and transparency</p>
