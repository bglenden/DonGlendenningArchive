<p><b>Education 20/20 Inc and Handle with Care…can the two programs can support each other?</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Education 20/20 believes that our future as individuals and a community will be shaped by the nature, level and quality of education we make available to our citizens.</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><i>The program Handle with Care promotes the social and emotional wellbeing of our youngest citizens’ birth to age 6 through parent and community engagement</i><span><i>.</i></span></p>
<p><i></i><br></p>
<p><b>Education 20/20 states that as a group we seek to encourage public engagement in education through organizing, discussion groups , seminars, workshops and round tables.</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Research tells us that social, emotional well-being also known as good mental health affects our total health, including our physical health and our </b><b><i>capacity to learn</i></b><b>.</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><i><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Handle with Care is a strength based program for parents of young children. As parents are their child’s first and most important teacher it is important they are<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>equipped with parenting skills that promote their child’s social and emotional well-being. (Approximately 100 PEI parents participated in the research component of HWC contributing valuable feedback and insights to the development of the program.)</i></p>
<p><i></i><br></p>
<p><b>Our research shows all parents want what is best for their children and </b><b><i>when given the opportunity will step up and do what needs to be done to ensure their child has the chance to reach their potential.</i></b></p>
<p><b><i></i></b><br></p>
<p><b><i></i></b><br></p>
<p><b><i></i></b><br></p>
<p><b>Education 20/20 states that we wish to promote high standards of education and well being for people of all ages</b>.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The program HWC has shown itself to be a community based program that builds on the strengths of parents, values every parent and child, sets a climate of trust and safety enabling participants to<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>grow in confidence and competence as they parent their young children. In so doing they report their children show much greater self regulation and more desirable behaviour all round. And, one amazing thing about the program is parents report that after participating they have greater capacity to deal with the ups and downs of life themselves.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Theory and practice have shown over and over that a sense of community has five elements:</b></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li9"><b>Meeting a need <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>2. Shared values <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>3. Being part of group (membership)</b></li>
</ul>
<p><b>4.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Shared emotional connection <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>5. Influence</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>HWC has an established program that includes all of the above 5 components and is one where Island parents have contributed to the research.</p>
<p>Island educators have contributed to the writing of and delivery of the program.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The question is&gt;&gt;&gt;</p>
<p><b>Can HWC be a program that meets the mandate of Education 20/20 and therefore be promoted in partnership by Education 20/20? Are we open for this discussion?</b></p>
