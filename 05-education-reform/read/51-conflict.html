  51 Conflict
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Explores the fundamental conflict between schools&#x27; teaching and sorting (ranking) functions. Argues that schools should help learners learn but shouldn&#x27;t also rank/sort students, citing the distinction between roles in sports (coaches vs. referees) and other professions. Discusses confusion between credentials and qualifications, credentials vs. qualifications, and the tension between formative assessment for learning versus summative assessment for sorting. Core argument: these incompatible roles place teachers in conflict and ultimately harms education.
- **Key People**: Teachers, learners, policymakers
- **Key Organizations**: Schools, educational institutions
- **Tags**: PROFESSIONAL, EDUCATION, MANUSCRIPT
- **Eulogy Relevance**: HIGH - Demonstrates Glendenning&#x27;s core philosophical concern about education system design and his advocacy for separating teaching from certification functions.</div>

<p><b>The problem/conflict</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>Schools are teaching institutions; their role is to help learners learn.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Each learner decides what he or she will learn, although others, including teachers, influence that decision. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Acquiring a credential is a sorting or ranking process; although the two functions are different, they appear closely linked and frequently one is thought to be the other.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>h functions is, to a large degree, provided or driven by educational institutions often works to the individual’s disadvantage in terms of both education and certification.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Even where separate bodies exist for their issuance, confusion remains.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>While separate certification bodies exist, they appear to place undue emphasis on results of study and too little emphasis on what has been learned outside the formal education system.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Unfortunately, over the years, the differences between credentials and qualifications has become blurred.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Used interchangeably in media</p>
<p>Numbers of years of schooling is used as a measure of education</p>
<p>Application forms ask for education when they mean schooling</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Education</b> is a lifelong process of gaining experiences that have a formative effect on the way we feel, think and act; it is a process of changing attitudes, skills and knowledge.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Education is a key factor in determining one’s quality of life; in the same way, the collective education of our citizens will determine to a significant degree the future quality of our community and country. Because of the importance of education, our country and community have invested heavily in a variety of educational support services including schools colleges and universities. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As part of the teaching process, teachers assess what learners have learned and, depending on the results, design and implement new teaching strategies</p>
