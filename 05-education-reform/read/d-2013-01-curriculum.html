  D 2013-01 Curriculum
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Don articulates his curriculum philosophy using Oregon State Department of Education&#x27;s life roles framework (individual, learner, family member, citizen, consumer, producer). He argues that education should prepare people for these multiple roles in contemporary society, not recreate yesterday&#x27;s educational model. He advocates for outcomes-based education with clearly stated graduation requirements. The systematic framework reflects Don&#x27;s organizational thinking and his belief that clear philosophical foundations should guide curriculum design rather than historical precedent.</div>

<p>Dear Sir:</p>
<p><b>Where does curriculum come from?</b><b></b></p>
<p>There is much talk from time to time about the need for a common curriculum across Canada; forget it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Even if we had the exact same document word for word, there would be slippage as to what gets taught and what gets learned – and further slippage as to what is reported. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>What would be helpful, however, would be a clear statement of graduation requirements, what every high school graduate should know and be able to do – and that is consistent with outcomes based education..<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But, even with that, we still need a curriculum and where does one look for that? <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Education, like life, is a journey so let’s examine the journey to see what kind of education would be most useful, I mean the journey we are taking not that of our parents and grandparents.<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>According to the Oregon State Department of Education, each lifetime will be filled with a number life roles, that of an individual, learner, family member, citizen, consumer and producer.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In my shorthand then, the role of education, including schools, is to help people participate as fully as thy can and want to in each of those roles. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>If that is so, then we should look to life, and these life roles, to identify the skills, knowledge and attitudes needed for our future, and we design to design educational experience to bring it about.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Where our parents were yesterday won’t help much.</p>
<p>Perhaps my view is too mechanistic, but I find that it provides a simple operating framework for decision-making about education, a field that is so important to our individual and collective futures. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Letters to the editor can bring about change even in something as seemingly impregnable as public education.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And of course, I’d like to hear from you at<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>HYPERLINK "mailto:standards2020@gmail.com" <span>standards2020@gmail.com</span> . <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
