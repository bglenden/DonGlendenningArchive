  D-5 Right to education
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">A blog post (Blog D-5) responding to &quot;People for Education,&quot; an Ontario organization launching a Canada-wide initiative to define young Canadians&#x27; education rights. Don proposes that rather than mandating school attendance until age 18, provinces could require demonstrated education competencies (literacy Level 3, numeracy, self-care, interpersonal relations, work entry) before citizens can own cars or open bank accounts, applying the six life roles model.</div>

<p>:</p>
<p>A right to Education</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>People for Education, an Ontario education organization, is launching a Canada -wide initiative to define education rights of young Canadians; It’s a good question and one that should be addressed too Canadians of all ages. It will be interesting to see how the project unfolds.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>As it stands now, young people are required to attend school until age 18; since going to school and getting aan education different, wouldn’t it be better to have young people demonstrate some level of education before they can own a car or open a bank account.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Citizens play a number of life roles; I like the Oregon classification - individual, family member, citizen, student, producer and consumer.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Seems to me that education should prepare people to cope, nay survive, in these roles in a democratic society.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>A Province may require, for instance that a citizen be able to read at Level 3 in order to purchase or drive a car. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The same could be said for other essential skills – literacy, numeracy, self care, interpersonal relations and work entry.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Simply requiring school attendance may not be enough</p>
