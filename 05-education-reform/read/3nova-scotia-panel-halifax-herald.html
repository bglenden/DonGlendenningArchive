  3Nova Scotia Panel - Halifax Herald
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Writing to the Chronicle Herald, Don commends Nova Scotia&#x27;s education review panel and offers three key pieces of advice: clarify whether studying education (personal development) or schooling (knowledge acquisition); recognize that current government operation differs from other sectors where professionals have independence; and address structural weaknesses (lack of autonomy, inflexibility, knowledge focus, absence of incentives) alongside professional issues. He emphasizes that education&#x27;s impacts on individual and collective futures make the review critically important.</div>

<p>Chronicle Herald</p>
<p>Halifax, Nova Scotia</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Dear Sir:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Education study announced</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I commend the Minister of Education for setting up a Review Panel to study what should be done to improve public education in Nova Scotia.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Changes are needed in public education everywhere, the move is timely and public input is key.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I have three bits of advice:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Have a clear focus.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is not clear to me whether the Nova Scotia study is about education or schooling.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Education is a broader term concerned with the development of the whole person; schooling is an important component of education with a focus on the acquisition of knowledge.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A study of either may be useful, but we shouldn’t confuse the two.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The “education” under study is not a partnership; as it now stands, schools are operated by the government, paid for by the taxpayer, and directed by the Minister who, I consider to be the CEO; in effect, the Minister decides what will be taught, by whom, when and for how long and hires and supervises the staff to do it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In fields like health and justice, for example, while the Government determines the services it will pay for, much of the actual delivery is handled by independent professionals, leaving the Minister of Health or Justice in quite a different role from the role of Minister of Education. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>As with many sectors, problems in the system may be professional or structural; proposals, however have mostly been focused on the professional side of the operation, additional technology, student outcomes, teacher qualifications and methodology.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Structural weaknesses such as lack of autonomy, inflexibility, focus on knowledge and the absence of incentives are often<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>overlooked, yet the latter offset the benefits of the former.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>What happens in and through education will determine to a large extent both our individual and collective futures.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A review is timely; don’t underestimate the importance of your study on the future of Nova Scotia.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I wish you well and look forward with interest to your findings and recommendations.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Don Glendenning</p>
<p>A long-time student of education</p>
