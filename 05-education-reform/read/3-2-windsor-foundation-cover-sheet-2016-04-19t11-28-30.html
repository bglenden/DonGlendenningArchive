<p><b>INTRODUCTION</b></p>
<p><b>Achievement Levels</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Mission/purpose of organization:<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span></b>Education 20/20 Inc. is federally incorporated as an independent, broad based, national, not-for-profit education organization, located in Charlottetown, PEI and is governed by a volunteer Board of Directors.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Our mission is to encourage and support a quality education for every Canadian; Education 20/20 Inc. is unique among educational organizations in Canada in that it is unaligned with any educational institutions, grade level, subject field or cause. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The organization operates with ten Directors, a network of some fifty people, and a mailing list of about almost 300.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Attached a list of activities by year since our incorporation; attached also is a draft plsn for thr coming year. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Although most Directors have participated in externally funded projects in their other roles, this is the first such project for Education 20/20 Inc. and certainly our first request for funding from the Windsor Foundation.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Proposal: </b>to design/develop a framework for designating meaningful levels of achievement in academic disciplines<span><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Issue being addressed</b></p>
<p>The project addresses the issue of measuring, reporting and interpreting a person’s achievement in academic disciplines in a manner that is reliable, consistent and fair understandable to those who use the results when making decisions about others</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>cy of school grades<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Currently grades are awaeded by individusl teaachers within somme guidelines established by the Department.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In PEI, for<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>example, there are neaely 2000 teachers awardsin grade levels to students.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Even with the best of intentions, there are bound to be differences in the standards.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Sdd to thst differing leveld oftraining for the job, themneed for teachers to keep abreast of changes in the profession, new findings in disciplines, cheating, social promotion, independwe propose to level the plsying field</p>
<p>Two reasond – now realize that ed stufies</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Relationship to Foundation Priorities</b><b></b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The project actually addresses both Windsor Foundation major areas of interest.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><b>Higher education initiatives:</b><span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></p>
<p>The project is being designed to provide university and college admission offices with relisble and consistent informstion about achievement levels of its applicants; ot would also do the same for oarents and employers</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Post secondary institutions continue to use successful high school graduation as the basic entrance rewuirement; that measure jnvolves a fairly ridged set ofsenior courses as determined in consultation with Departments of Educationuse high school graduation as cAlthough not as well documented, we’ve also been made aware of the many young people now in college and university who struggle with their studies because of low level of basic skills; the writer actually visited make-up classes as part of the information gathering process. the duplication of services is a strain on taxpayer’s dollars.</p>
<p><b>Disadvantaged or vulnerable youth</b>: The participants are disadvantaged youth in that they lack certain basic skills, this proposal addresses the issue of basic skills, those skills needed to gain entry to the next phase of life and, without which many are branded as failures.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We are aware that sometimes this may result from poor decisions by<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>students<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>themselves; on the other hand, we are also aware that the gap may from incorrect information, biased counselling, streaming, out dated course content, poor teaching, inflexible scheduling, lack of encouragement and mentoring, and the list goes on</p>
<p><b>Characteristics of public education:</b></p>
<p>In putting forth this project, the proposer is aware of the following characteristics of the education enterprise, including:</p>
<p><b>Silo nature of schools:</b><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The nature of the education enterprise reinforces silo practices, time based instructional segments, age based grouping, clearly defined Institutional boundaries, single teacher led classrooms, and laboratory based curriculum development, The most readily identifiable educational silos on PEI include the public school system, the university, private schools, colleges (2), literacy training, continuing education, and the many “NGO” education and training projects.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Government documents clearly show that the role of the Department of Education is limited to public instruction thereby making the Premier the actual Minister of Education. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Inconsistencies on curriculum alignment:</b><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>refers to the practice of ensuring that each element of education supports the program as a whole. Alignment starts with a clear mission statement, attainable and measurable goals, relevant curriculum, appropriate instructional methodology, unbiased assessment and accurate reporting.</p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Subject centered resources and instruction.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span></b>Education is a very personal and individual developmental experience; school instruction, on the other hand, is a product delivery system with the product development by one professional and the delivery by another. Neither does the system give sufficient attention to student development in the affective and psychomotor domains. There is little inclination or opportunity for customizing at the point where student and teacher meet.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The literature, leaders and the community call for change but, at least to date, there is little evidence that the call is being heard.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Recognized standards and assessment reveal confusion between grades and standards, the lack of </b>criterion referenced standards and some confusion as to the role of teachers in the evaluation process.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A review of alignment is long overdue.</p>
<p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><b>PROGRAM NARRATIVE</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Proposal:</b></p>
<p>To develop a simple curriculum map that identifies a set of skills as being those required to function as a citizen, to enter postsecondary institutions or enter employment; such to become a common master lists for use by students, teachers, employers and postsecondary institutions.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Our proposal has several innovative features including (1) a curriculum map to be used by teachers and learners alike, it also ensures that students and teachers have the same view of the content and process, to ensures that common map to be used by learners and teachers alike so that students and teachers have the same view of the process, (2) it to a single analysis with multiple profiles instead of the current approach of creating a map for each grade, (3) engaging s broad range of users and providers in the curriculum development process and (4) encourages<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>all educators to see themselves as a team.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></p>

<p>Appendix A</p>
<p><b>Education 20/20 Inc.</b></p>
<p><b>Preparedness 2- Skills of Citizenship</b></p>
<p><b>Introduction:</b></p>
<p>In late 2013, The Community Foundation of Prince Edward Island (CFPEI) undertook a survey of over 200 Island youth to identify issues that directly affect them; the report, T<span>aking the Pulse of Island Youth</span>, available on the Foundation’s website at<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>HYPERLINK "http://www.cfpei.ca" <span>www.cfpei.ca,</span> provides a snapshot of the findings.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Bright spots include a positive sense of community, emerging entrepreneurial spirit, volunteerism and new postsecondary offerings.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The main concerns include a lack of jobs, surviving on low-paying jobs, educational deficiencies and drug and alcohol addictions.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>On the subject of education and learning, the study reports a high rate of completion of high school and postsecondary education, a high level of inclusivity and relatively affordable tuition costs; young people also<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>expressed concerns about their readiness for the next stage of life including:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><b><i>“preparedness gaps with regard to readiness for</i></b></p>
<p><b><i>post- secondary study and the workplace” </i></b><b>– Vital Signs, CFPEI, 2013</b><b></b></p>
<p>Following the publication of the CFPEI Report, Education 20/20 organized five public discussions for the purpose of informing the community of the report and its findings, learning more about youth issues in our communities, exploring issues of education and learning, and to identify actions to be taken to close gaps.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Discussions were lively and wide ranging, and carried on well after the formal session ended. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The final report included a number of conclusions and recommendations of which the recommendation below triggered this proposal.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><b><i>Further study be undertaken to clarify the gaps in preparation for further study and for work - (Preparedness,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Education 20/20 Inc., Occasional Paper No. 1)</i></b><b><i></i></b></p>
<p>Education 20/20 has continued its exploration under the title, “citizenship skills” meaning those required of any citizens and considered to be a basic foundation for life changes that are likely to occur including skills needed for entrance into employment and expected for acceptance into postsecondary studies.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As evidence I refer to PISA test results for Prince Edward Island; a 2013 survey of issues of Island youth conducted by the Community Foundation; a presentation to a Standing Committee of the PEI Legislative Assembly by the Charlottetown Area chamber of Commerce; How Canada Performs, a Provincial and Territorial Ranking, Education and Training; Education and Skills, and a series of workshops on Preparedness held throughout PEI by Education 20/20 Inc.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The PEI Department of Education has not taken exception to the findings nor, to the best of our knowledge, assumed a leadership role that includes corrective action.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Based on our consultations, a pilot in the area of math has the most likely chance of success.</p>
<p><b>Based on our explorations, it is the view of Education 20/20 that:</b></p>
<p>The math gap is real</p>
<p>Low basic skill levels on PEI are an issue</p>
<p>Low basic skill levels are dragging down the economy of PEI</p>
<p>Basic skill levels are not consistently defined</p>
<p>Skills thought to have been learned while in high school, are being taught again in Adult Basic Education program at Holland College.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>PEI lacks a master list of recognized basic skills</p>
<p>PEI lacks a single body to give direction to its education efforts</p>
<p>Basic skills do not appear to be a priority</p>
