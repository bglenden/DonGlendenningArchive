  106 math
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">July 4, 2019 letter proposing a math skills mapping initiative for everyday Islander living. Don identifies three reasons for the focus: importance for individuals/community, frequency of math concerns in public conversation, and disconnect between standardized testing results and workforce/further study outcomes. Advocates for citizen-based math mapping, restructured rating scales, and common analysis across math instruction on PEI.</div>

<p><b>Dear Sir:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b><b></b></p>
<p><b>Math Initiative</b></p>
<p>D-106</p>
<p>I’ve been queried in recent days as to why I’m so focused on math instruction in our public schools; most of it arises from the proposal to map the math skills used by Islanders in their every day living. There are essentially three reasons: math is important for individuals and for the community, of all school subjects, it’s the subject most often mentioned in my conversations with Islanders, improvement in Pan Canadian testing and PISA results do not seem to translate into improvement in the workforce or further studies and educators have not done a very good job of explaining the conundrum.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I suspect that the math “problem” arises from one of the following.</p>
<p>Communication – I find education generally lcking in principles, definitions, etc.ytansparency</p>
<p>Analysis – math is a tool or perhaps a set of tools; we use it every day in a variety of ways.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Yes, we need to know something about the tool itself but for most of us, we simply need to be skilled users in our daily living. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Curriculum development -<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Math competencies, skills or outcomes are used for many purposes including curriculum development, assessment, job description, qualifications.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Identifying and describing competencies, etc.<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>They are, can and many would say should be, identified separately of education,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Educators may advise learners bout<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>various competencies and help others learn to perform them,</p>
<p>Rating scales<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>maeed to be restructured to differentiate<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>between peple who can perform well occasionally from others who can perform fluently (quickly, ccurately<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>and consistently),<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p>king with friends recently about continuing education in Souris when the matter of mathematics levels came up;<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Seems that it is hard for one level to tell just what a student learned at an earlier level. I read earlier this summer about an Ontario university had trouble sorting high school grades from different schools being quite different.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There’s a question also about why recent graduates couldn’t simply fill in certain gaps<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>that may eist., especially for people who recently graduated.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Now I understand that students may be at different levels in a subject but I don’t understand why transcripts don’t simply show a students actual levels.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Outcomes based education should make it easier to document, and even compare, progress.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I suspect that the problem arises from an incompatible rating scale; sometimes change to outcomes but try to make the old grading scale wotk. Both must change. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The other problem faced by competency based system is how to convert compterncies to courses and credits.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Based on my experience, it is a loing battle.figure ourt hours an</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>It would be a gret tep forward on this small Island if instruction in mathematics could strt from a common analysis and use a common raing scale.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Sincerely,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
