</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Media release announcing Education 20/20&#x27;s initiative to diagram and understand the learning path. Reports that 22 Islanders (parents, business community, educators) met at Haviland Club to discuss a draft learning path model. Describes learning path concept as visual representation of learning as process, developed from learner perspectives and input. Notes that learners identified helpful support elements including information, encouragement, practice, feedback, self-study materials, instruction, and self-analysis. Acknowledges challenge of accommodating different learning styles and paces. Details Education 20/20&#x27;s intention to refine model by incorporating affective domain learning, learner interests, discovery learning, and motivation. Plans to distribute findings via newsletter and website.

<span lang="en-US">Charting a learning path is not easy, but 22
Islanders thought it was important enough to give it a try.  The
group, consisting of parents, members of the business community,
educators and others  with an interest in the subject, met at the
Haviland Club to exchange views on  a draft “learning path”
developed by Education 20/20 Inc. A learning path, as envisaged by
Education 20/20, is based on the view that learning is a process and,
like any process, can be shown in chart or graph form.  </span>

<span lang="en-US">The process started some months ago with a
question to learners about the kind of help they found useful when
learning something new; their list included such items as
information, encouragement, practice, feedback, self- study
materials, instruction and self- analysis.  The second question asked
of students concerned the order in which help was needed.  Since not
all learners learn at the same pace and have different learning
style, showing how to chart a path that provides help to students
when they need it, posed a major issue.  The process was drafted and
presented to the group for discussion.</span></p>

<span lang="en-US">A learning path is an attempt to increase
understanding through visualizing the steps taken by a learner,
learning from a learner’s perspective so to speak; only when we
understand the learning process, can we properly design an education
system to support it.  To quote one participant, it is an attempt “to
model the process of how we learn”.  While obviously of interest to
those who teach, it may also be of interest to parents, group leaders
or others who instruct or make decisions about our education system.</span></p>

<span lang="en-US">The result is a draft, although not a perfect one,
and an interest in discussing the matter further; a couple of people
have already provided follow-up comments. Education 20/20 will return
to the drawing board and try to factor in such things as learning in
the affective domain, learner interests, discovery learning.
motivation and whether a single model can be drawn for learners of
all ages.  Education 20/20 plans to distribute the findings in a
future newsletter and post the learning path on its website. </span>
