<div class="reader-summary">Fourth draft editor letter analyzing the Department of Education&#x27;s narrow role statement and its consequences. Contrasts education with health, noting health maintains patient focus while education focuses on schools rather than learners. Notes education&#x27;s narrowed focus over 50 years disadvantages non-university-bound youth. Critiques goal statements as misleading and advocates for reconceptualizing education&#x27;s purpose to encompass all life roles (citizenship, employment, personal development), affecting curriculum selection, assessment, and grading practices.</div>

<div class="reader-content">
<p>Dear Editor:</p>
<p>Draft 4</p>
<p>Issues in Education</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>For some time now I’ve engaged with Islanders in conversations about a wide range of education topics; conversations reveal a desire for information and dialogue, not just about school matters, but also about education and what we can do to make it better. The other side of my explorations is the reluctance of educators to share information about<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>what they do. The reason for this, I concluded, results from embedding the education function in a government Department; whereas, in similar circumstances, health has been able<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>to maintain a focus on patients, education has focused on schools rather than learners.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it seems to me that the focus of public education has narrowed considerably in the past fifty years at the expense of young people who are not university bound.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Take the goal of the Department of Education, for example.</p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li6">The Department of Education goal of “developing and delivering programs” to young people greatly under states the task and is actually misleading.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My reading suggests that education’s function is to help people develop skills, knowledge and attitudes and other attributes to help in all “life roles”. Furthermore, one’s purpose is a major determinant of what one should study and how performance will be measured. Although I realize that the role as stated is substantially the same as that of the previous government, that is not an argument for keeping it; those framing a role statement my fing statements in neighbouring provinces to be helpful</li>
  <li class="li6">A revised description of role or purpose is essential to selecting <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>content and appropriate applications.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If the foocus is on citizenship then learning activities should reflect that view</li>
  <li class="li6">Clear purpose is a must for assessment and grading. Employment, for example values timeneeded to complete <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>a task moreso that for a general education</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p>My reading of the literature suggests that an educated person is one who has the skills, knowledge and other attributes to deal with the happenings<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>of every day life. Should this be the meaning of a high school graduation diploma?</p>
<p>Islanders would appreciate and education would benefit from a public conversation about what education is trying to provide<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>– and why.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p><br></p>
