  9 Right Thing
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">This letter to editors (January 15, 2019, draft) reveals Don&#x27;s leadership philosophy, connecting his experience founding Holland College (50 years prior) with his current advocacy. He recounts adopting &quot;do the next right thing&quot;—a strategy he learned from a book (Cry the Beloved Country) while observing apartheid struggles in South Africa. Applied to PEI, he identifies the next right priority as developing &quot;a clear and compelling vision of education for Islanders of all interests, all ages, all communities and all life roles—not just school-age Islanders.&quot; He urges establishing a vision-setting committee whose members are chosen for their views rather than constituent representation, and emphasizes that the Department must own the vision, not just adopt it. This piece provides valuable insight into Don&#x27;s philosophy and his belief that Islanders have lost hope in educational improvement.</div>

<p><b>Dear Sir:</b></p>
<p><b>The next right thing<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b><b></b></p>
<p><b>Draft</b></p>
<p><b>Writing this letter takes me back fifty years.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I had been tasked with bringing a new college on stream; we were starting from scratch; everything, it seemed, had to be “done first”.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was a bit overwhelming.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was also a time of turmoil in South Africa. In the case of apartheid, a friend recommended a book, Cry the Beloved Country, which revealed the dilemma of a local bishop wrestling with the issue of apartheid in his church.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The issue was huge, complex, involved people with strongly differing points of view, and had the potential to split the denomination.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The bishop resolved his leadership dilemma by adopting the practice of “doing the next right thing.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>While my decisions were small scale, compared to the Bishop’s, that strategy has been a pillar of my own decision-making ever since.</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Applying the above guideline to PEI, I believe that “the next right thing” is a “clear and compelling vision of education for Islanders – Islanders of all interests, all ages, all communities and all life roles –not just Islanders of school age or in school.<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Such a statement should be limited to a page or two, in language of the public with goals, if any, realistic and measurable. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Seek the advice of a consultant if needed. but the report should be owned, not just adopted by, the Department.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Assuming the establishment of a committee, members should be invited because of their views not because they represent constituents.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Islanders have given up on educational improvement; let an updated mission statement prove them wrong.</b></p>
<p><b><span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></b></p>
<p><b>Sincerely,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
