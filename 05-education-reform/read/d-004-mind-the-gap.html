</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Collection of related essays on education gaps and support structures. Proposes family education advisor role (similar to family doctor) providing independent advice to Islanders on education decisions. Discusses gap between available support (mostly school-based counseling) and needed support (community-based, lifespan). Includes advocacy for reading clinics outside school system (paid from education budgets). Addresses ombudsman role vs. advisor role. Proposes recognizing student advocates and supporting dropout-prevention like Pathways to Education. Emphasizes education complexity, multiple life roles, and provider fragmentation.

	<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">The process of getting an education
	is a complex one; it involves developing the knowledge, skills and
	attitudes that enable us to live a full and productive life; choices
	abound and each choice has its own consequences.    Families have a
	family doctor, perhaps a financial advisor, often an accountant,
	sometimes a lawyer and perhaps other advisers, but when it comes to
	education, a much more complex field, learners and families are left
	on their own.

	<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">Jan Hodges (“Careers education
	needs to be an ongoing dialogue, in which information is discussed
	at every stage”, Manchester Guardian, Wednesday, May 29)
	identified the need to expand existing school-based counselling with
	“independent advice and guidance” about career education for
	16-18 year-old youth; information would be directed not only to
	young people but also to their parents and teachers.   
	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in"><br />
<br />

	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">The need for advice on educational
	matters, however, exists well beyond careers and school walls;
	people of all ages could benefit from information, counseling,
	direction, advice and sometimes just an attentive ear.  Guidance
	counselors work with students in school; educational advisors would
	be available to anyone but would mostly serve people not in school.

	<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">Two bits of advice that I was given
	years ago have stood me in good stead; when a long term plan is not
	clear, ‘do the next right thing’ and do it now.  Below is a
	short list of actions for your consideration.  They are steps in the
	right direction, can be instituted immediately at little or no
	incremental cost and with a minimum disruption to teaching-learning
	process:

	<ul>
		<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><b>Students
		and Parents –  </b>as consumers of school services<b>, </b>I
		would like to say “shop around”, however, given that schooling
		is a monopoly offered almost wholly by the government, that is not
		possible.  You should, however, not hesitate to talk frequently and
		in depth with your teacher(s).  And be specific about vocabulary,
		comprehension, attendance, likelihood of graduating, etc.  Have the
		same kind of conversation with your teacher that you would have
		with your doctor.</p></li>
		<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><b>Teachers </b>–
		review educational outcomes for your subjects’ to ensure that
		they are clear, unambiguous and measurable.  Most outcomes I
		encounter in the educational literature have strayed far from the
		path.</p></li>
		<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><b>Department
		</b>– identify reading as a separate subject and include it on
		school report cards.</p></li>
		<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><b>Trustees</b>
		– conduct exit interviews with every student who leaves school
		without graduating to pinpoint the causes and to ensure that you
		are prviding the best schooling you can...</p></li>
		<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><b>Employers</b>
		– base hiring decisions on skills required rather than subjects
		studied.  Schools prepare students to enter the next level of
		education or to go to work.  Requirements to enter college or
		university are quite clear; skills desired for the workplace are
		still a work in progress.</p></li>

<br />

	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">Recently
	I had a conversation with a parent whose child is not reading “at
	grade level”; I’ve often had the same conversation, especially
	with grandparents.  It seems that the student in question
	encountered difficulty with reading.  Or it could be a case of a
	teacher having difficulty with the teaching of reading.  In each
	case the student enrolled in a private school with parents or
	grandparents paying the tuition.  In all the cases brought to my
	attention, private instruction worked and reading skills improved,
	dramatically.</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in"><br />
<br />

	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">Schools
	cannot be expected to have all the expertise and resources needed to
	teach everything to everyone.  But reading is a “must know”
	skill and should, therefore, have priority over all other subjects.
	Without a reasonable level of reading, lifelong learning is lost. 
	Furthermore, when a school cannot help a student reach a reasonable
	level of reading, I believe that it is the school’s responsibility
	to find a solution and to pay the cost.  There’s no reason why a
	parent should have to pay the extra tuition while also paying taxes.
	 Such an expense should be an item in each school budget.</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in"><br />
<br />

	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">Perhaps
	it’s time to allow, even encourage, reading clinics outside school
	system in the same way that we allow health services outside the
	hospital, paid for of course, out of  the education budget on a fee
	for service basis.</p>

	Friends
	may recall me saying on occasion that education could benefit from
	having the advice of a “family education advisor”, someone who
	would serve a role in education similar to that of a family doctor
	for our health needs.  Operating outside the school system, an
	advisor would be available to any Islander who needs assistance in
	making decisions about their education.  Like a family doctor, th

	advocate, someone who has a vested interest in helping student</p>
	<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
	Then
	a few days ago, there was an item in, I believe, the Washington
	Post, to the effect  that the matter of a student ombudsman was
	under active consideration.  An ombudsman fills a different role and
	may be necessary because  education is, in effect, a requirement,
	that choice is minimum and there is really only one provider.
