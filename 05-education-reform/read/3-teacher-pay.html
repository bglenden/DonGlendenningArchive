  3 Teacher pay
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Don argues that quality teachers are underpaid and that compensation should reflect the diverse and complex work teachers perform—coaching, instructing, diagnosing, counseling, assessing, and developing materials. He criticizes grid-based salary systems using credentials and years of service rather than performance and effectiveness. Don advocates for competency-based compensation reflecting actual work contribution, arguing that professional remuneration should reward excellent teachers more than average ones. He contends that education systems constrain teacher professionalism by dictating what, when, where, and how teachers work, suppressing individual creativity and accountability, and proposes that enabling teacher professionalism would increase high performance.</div>

<p>Dear Editor:</p>
<p>Teacher Pay</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Catherine Ford makes a valid point about the role of teachers (Guardian, Wednesday, August 25). To take it</p>
<p>a step further, I believe teachers are underpaid - at least good teachers are. I may be the only person on</p>
<p>Prince Edward lsland, other than teachers themselves, who thinks that but I stand my ground on the issue.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Most people are paid for what they do; teachers should be paid on that basis also. Their roles are unique,</p>
<p>they coach, instruct, prepare instructional materials, present information, lead discussions, counsel,</p>
<p>diagnose, rate performance, develop learning activities, review assignments and many other things. As a</p>
<p>result, students improve existing skills and learn new ones. That's what teachers' do; that's what they</p>
<p>should be paid for, and those who are good at what they do should earn more than those who aren't.</p>
<p>Remuneration should reflect the work done and not the qualifications of the incumbent</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Currently, teachers' salaries are based on a grid showing years of formal training and years of experience.</p>
<p>It is easy to administer but it doesn't make sense. A degree may be a requirement to enter the profession</p>
<p>but having a degree, or two or three, should not determine one's salary.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Teaching is a profession but the education system constrains teachers from acting professionally.</p>
<p>Decisions as to what is taught, when, where, how, for how long and to what level are determined for, and</p>
<p>not by, teachers; the creativity, performance and accountability of individual teachers is submerged.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Changing the system, I believe, would result in more high-performing teachers; if education is as important</p>
<p>as we say it is, let's start paying teachers for what they do.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
