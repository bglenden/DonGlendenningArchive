  School shakeup
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Using the same struggling mathematics student case, Don criticizes how schools handle academic difficulty through structural barriers rather than academic support. When students move to lower-level courses, schools create detours that reduce post-secondary options, delay advancement, decrease employment prospects, and potentially damage lifetime earning potential and personal development. Don emphasizes that education&#x27;s purpose is to help students develop their fullest capacities, and that alternative options—extra instruction, specialized support, remediation—better serve this goal than institutional detours that effectively limit futures.</div>

<p>Dear Sir:</p>
<p>Structural change</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The role of a school is to open doors, to create opportunities, for young people; but not all schools do that.<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Door closera often come up in conversations but for some reason, this time<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>the impact struck home. Granted, I do not have all the facts but here’s my understanding.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>A high school student, with hopes, even plans to go to college or university, was having difficulty with math; that’s not unusual; I am told that struggling with math is not uncommon. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>So what are a school’s options?</p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li1">Let the a student struggle and likely fail a grade,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li1">Suggest an upgrading course after graduation</li>
  <li class="li1">Provide extra instruction</li>
  <li class="li1">Transfer the student a lower level course</li>
  <li class="li1">Recommend private tutoring</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p>I’ve heard many good stories about tutoring but it is out of reach for many parents; if a student could benefit from tutoring and the school cannot provide it, the cost should be covered by the education budget; why should a parent be expected to pay both taxes and the cost of tuition, especially for something as basic as math?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In this case the school chose option 4; the student is now in a lower-level math class. In effect, the school created a detour, no a barrier, in his path to education.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>At best, this option delays entrance to postsecondary studies, reduces the likelihood of that student going to college or university, it reduces the chance of a smooth transition to employment and<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>likely<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>to a significant reduction in his lifetime income; at worst, it may divert him from being the citizen he is capable of being, the citizen we want him to be.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Education documents tell us education, and presumably schooling, is intended to help students to develop to their fullest capacities.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The option chosen for this student fails to fulfil that goal. Personally, I am more concerned by cases of this kind than by low PISA and PCAP scores.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
<p><br></p>

<p>A long time student of education</p>
