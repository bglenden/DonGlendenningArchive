<div class="reader-summary">Letter to Charlottetown Guardian editor by Don proposing curriculum development based on life roles framework (individual, learner, family member, citizen, consumer, producer) rather than common curriculum. Advocates for clear graduation requirements and education-centered approach.</div>

<div class="reader-content">
<p>January 2, 2013</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Editor, Charlottetown Guardian</p>
<p>Charlottetown, PEI	</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Dear Sir:</p>
<p><b>Where does curriculum come from?</b><b></b></p>
<p>There is much talk from time to time about the need for a common curriculum across Canada; forget it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Even if we had the exact same document word for word, there would be slippage as to what gets taught and what gets learned – and further slippage as to what is reported. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>What would be helpful, however, would be a clear statement of graduation requirements, what every high school graduate should know and be able to do.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But, even with that, we still need a curriculum and where does one look for that? <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>If education, like life is a journey, I suggest that we start there.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Let’s identify the kind of education that would be most useful on that journey –both the journey itself and the destination.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That decision was made easy for me a few years ago when I encountered, and actually adopted, the concept of life roles developed by the Oregon Department of Education some 20 years ago.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>According to their view, during our lifetime we fill the following life roles, that of an individual, learner, family member, citizen, consumer and producer.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In my shorthand then, the role of education is to help people participate as fully as thy want to in each of those roles.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Schools have a major role in nurturing education, but it needs much further clarification.</p>
<p>The focus for curriculum development quickly becomes clear, first to identify the skills, knowledge and attitudes needed for the various life roles in today’s society and, second, and to design educational experience to bring it about.</p>
<p>Perhaps my view is too mechanistic, but I find that it provides a simple operating framework for decision-making about education, a field that is so important to our individual and collective futures. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Letters to the editor can bring about change even in something as seemingly impregnable as public education.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And of course, I’d like to hear from you at<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>HYPERLINK "mailto:standards2020@gmail.com" <span>standards2020@gmail.com</span> . <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
<p><br></p>
