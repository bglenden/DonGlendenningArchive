<div class="reader-summary">Don provides his standard definitions for education-related concepts, including education, learning, school, college, and university. Drawing on the Oregon Department of Education&#x27;s &quot;life roles&quot; model, he outlines six roles (individual, family member, citizen, student, producer, consumer) and argues education contributes to all. He advocates for the PEI Department of Education to clarify and review its purpose, as clear definitions are essential for maintaining a strong education system.</div>

<p>About Education</p>
<p>	B</p>
<p>Some Definitions</p>
<p>I am not sure just how our Department of Education defines education, but here is my usual response whn asked:</p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li3"><b>Education</b>: a process of arranging experiences that help people learn</li>
  <li class="li3"><b>Learning</b>: changing the level of one’s information, skills, attitudes<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>or other attributes.</li>
  <li class="li3"><b>Education:</b> a sector of the economy focused on providing services to people who want to learn</li>
  <li class="li3"><b>Educated:</b> a level of education said to equip people to solve most problems of everyday life.</li>
  <li class="li3"><b>School:</b> a facility designed, equipped and staffed to support the education process.</li>
  <li class="li3">Graduate: complete a program of study recognized by an education institution</li>
  <li class="li3"><b>College: </b>an educational institution providing higher education, specialized or vocational training</li>
  <li class="li3"><b>University</b>: an educational institution designed for instruction and examination of students in various fields of learning</li>
</ul>
<p>Sincerely</p>

<p>About Education</p>
<p>	C</p>
<p><b>Purpose</b></p>
<p><b>Each person has their own reason for pursuing/improving their education. For most people, improving education increases their likelihood of surviving and thriving in future years.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Communities also support education in the expectation that it will improve the community as a place to live.</b></p>
<p><b>In my reflection, I adopted the “life roles” model used by the Oregon Department of Education. According to Oregon, we each fill six life roles: individual, family member, citizen, student, producer and consumer. Presumably education contributes to all, but there are others:</b></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li3"><b>The transmission of knowledge,s kills and character traits</b></li>
  <li class="li3"><b>The act or process of imparting or acquiring knowledge<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></li>
  <li class="li3"><b>The knowledge or<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>training acquired by the education process</b></li>
</ul>
<p><b>I write this in order to encourage the Department to review and clarify its purpose because the Department’s definition is not clear and, furthermore, a clear purpose is required to have a strong system.</b></p>
