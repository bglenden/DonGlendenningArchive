  2016-11 PISA
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">While celebrating PEI&#x27;s improved PISA test results, Don warns against conflating academic achievement with genuine education. He defines education as the patchwork of experiences—many outside classrooms—that alter how people think, feel, and act. Drawing OECD parallels to agriculture, fisheries, and justice, he argues government should provide leadership and ensure equity rather than operate schools directly. He cites OECD research showing schools with greater autonomy and accountability through public achievement data perform better, advocating for school autonomy paired with transparency.</div>

<p>Editor,</p>
<p>	</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Dear Sir:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>My framework</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I’m delighted to see improvement in our PISA test results; those who led the change deserve our thanks.  But I’m also concerned that success with PISA could result in a focus on academic achievement rather than  improvement in education. While I value schooling, we cannot, if we ever could, judge one’s level of education by the institution attended, the length if time enrolled, grades received, the field of study or the piece of parchment awarded.  One’s education is a result of a patchwork of experiences that altered the way we think, feel and act; many of our education<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>experiences, perhaps most, were initiated and orchestrated outside a classroom.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Government has a major role in agriculture, fisheries and the field of justice yet it does not catch the fish, till the soil nor apply the law; neither should it operate our schools.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Government’s role is one of providing leadership and ensuring equity. If PISA test results shape our thinking, perhaps we should also heed some OECD conclusions.</p>
<p>“In countries where schools have greater autonomy over what is taught and how students are assessed, students tend to perform better.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>In countries where schools account for their results by posting achievement data publicly, schools that enjoy greater autonomy in resource allocation tend to show better student performance than those with less autonomy.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>In countries where there are no such accountability arrangements, schools with greater autonomy in resource allocation tend to perform worse.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Don Glendenning</p>
<p>A long-time student of education</p>
