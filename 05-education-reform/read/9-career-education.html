  9 Career education
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Commending new island programs in welding, carpentry, and automotive technology, Glendenning emphasizes that each educational level should prepare for the next level or employment. While schools have emphasized further education preparation, these new courses recognize employment preparation responsibility. He advocates measuring career course achievement against workplace criteria rather than academic standards—quality, supervision level, and quantity of work. He suggests work-based criteria should be added to transcripts and urges employer representatives to participate in program advisory committees. Commending the Minister&#x27;s leadership, he calls for expanding career programs to non-traditional fields.</div>

<p>Dear Editor:</p>
<p>Career Education</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I was delighted to read of the new programs being developed for lsland schools in welding,</p>
<p>carpentry and automotive technology. Each level of education has a responsibility to provide</p>
<p>students with the skills required to enter the next level of education or to enter gainful</p>
<p>employment. The school system has focused on preparation for further education; the new</p>
<p>courses recognize responsibility for employment preparation as well.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>For career courses to be successful, achievement or performance should be measured against</p>
<p>the criteria of the work place. An advertisement in the Guardian of Monday, February 26for</p>
<p>"Welders, Fabricators and Machinists" identified two performance based criteria, quality of</p>
<p>work and degree of supervision. To this I would add quantity of work or time required to</p>
<p>perform the skill (not to be confused with the time required to learn it). I trust that a</p>
<p>representative of the company that placed that advertisement is on the program advisory</p>
<p>committee.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I believe that preparing people to enter the work force is a major role of our education system.</p>
<p>It would improve the transition from school to work, however, if schools and employers used</p>
<p>some of the same criteria and terminology for assessing performance - as a minimum, perhaps</p>
<p>work-related criteria could be added to transcripts. Doing so could go a long way in bridging the</p>
<p>gap between what schools do and what society expects them to do.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I want to commend the Minister for her leadership and I look forward to the introduction of</p>
<p>career programs in non-traditional career programs as well.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
<p><br></p>
