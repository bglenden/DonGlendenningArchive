  D  Peaceful protest
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Dated April 14, 2014, this brief letter thanks Wendy Budgeon for her public advocacy on education issues, particularly referencing the &quot;Taking the Pulse of Island Youth&quot; report and Education 20/20 discussions. Don acknowledges that educators often cannot speak freely about needed changes without career risk, and calls on citizens to voice support for educational reform. The letter reflects his conviction that public engagement is essential to advancing education policy and reveals his collaborative approach to systemic change.</div>

<p><br></p>
<p>Dear Sir:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I want to thank Wendy Budgeon for her efforts in support of a better education for Islanders (Guardian, April 14, 4014); a recent report, Taking the Pulse of Island Youth, www.cfpei.ca, also pointed to gaps in education, especially, in relation to preparation for further studies and for work.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In addition, Education 20/20 Inc. has just completed a series of public discussions in four Island locations and the level of math and communications skills came up in every one.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I especially want to thank her making her views public.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Recently during a discussion, a student spoke of the need for Islanders to speak out in support of changes in education; in fact, she actually spoke of the need for courage.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is not likely that teachers and other educators feel free to make their views known, especially if they favour change but want to continue to teach and live in PEI.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The rest of us will have to speak<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>for them.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Again, to Wendy I say thanks for your courage and keep up the good work.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Don Glendenning</p>
<p>A long-time student of education</p>
