  A Clarity C 
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Don analyzes conceptual clarity issues in PEI education, identifying eight areas needing reform: terminology, functions/services, education vs. schooling distinction, purpose, structure, autonomy, accountability, and self-correcting mechanisms. Drawing on World Bank and OECD research, he argues these are easily correctable structural problems that require systemic change to modernize education delivery.</div>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 108%"><b>The
literature speaks of the need for educational reform; the writer sees
it as a call for clarity. Uncertainties include:</b></p>
<ol>
	<li><p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0in"><b>Terminology
	– </b>The
	education literature needs to be read carefully. No word has a
	simple meaning; every word seems to have multiple meanings or at
	least multiple shadings of the same meaning.  In an endeavour as
	large and complex as education, It is likely that shades of meanings
	exist. A PEI lexicon would be very helpful.</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0in"><b>Functions
	and services</b><b>
	- </b> Education is a
	service; typical ducation functions or services include:
	information, counselling, instruction, products and technology,
	quality assurance. governance, funding and human resources. Learners
	may need one or all  services at any point in their education
	journey.  Services need to  be clearly identified and available to
	all Island citizens not just to citizens enrolled in schools and
	programs.  How services are organized and paid for is a separate
	issue..</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0in"><b>Education
	versus schooling</b>
	– The World Bank, the largest funder of public education, cautions
	Ministries of Education about treating “education and going to
	school” as though they are one and the same. That belief I also
	encounter this view in my conversations and in the PEI education
	literature. A school, like a hospital is only a resource- rich
	location; education results from experiences gained while there. 
	</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0in"><b>Purpose
	- </b><b>sets
	the stage for what we do, how we organize and how we measure.Helping
	peole find a place in society is insufficient direction o develop
	programs or  measure progress.</b></p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0in"><b>Structure
	– </b><b>education
	is a service; the current structures treat education as though it is
	a product.</b></p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0in"><b>Autonomy
	– </b><b>a
	service requires front line staff to have both a high level
	experience and autonomy to tailor services to client needs. The OECD
	tells us that student do better from schools with autonomy for their
	day to day operations.</b></p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0in"><b>Accountability
	– </b><b>accountability
	for student for student development is unclear.</b></p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0in"><b>Self-
	correcting mechanism –</b>
	lack of a self – correcting mechanism</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0in"><b>Government
	protection, fear factor, </b>
