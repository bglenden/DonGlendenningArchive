<div class="reader-summary">A comprehensive letter calling for education sector clarity on four fronts. First, defining education itself: Don references the Education Act&#x27;s definition (&quot;imparting or acquiring knowledge&quot;) but expands to include skills, attitudes, and attributes for contemporary life. Second, identifying kinds of help learners need: counseling, instruction, learning products, technology, assessment, and others. Third, establishing organizational responsibility to &quot;encourage, support and regulate services&quot;—recognizing that provinces operate school systems rather than education systems. Fourth, making education system development a priority. Don references relevant literature (OECD, World Bank Report 2018, Montreal Economic Institute, OECD Education 2030) and notes recent senior Department management changes may enable desired restructuring. The letter synthesizes Don&#x27;s year-long advocacy campaign, presenting his accumulated insights as urgent policy priorities requiring immediate attention.</div>

<p>Dear Editor:</p>
<p><b>A CALL FOR CLARITY</b></p>
<p>											</p>
<p>Some time ago, I set out to explore public education with a view to better understanding concerns of the local community. Education is complex; it is deeply embedded in our culture and information plays a key role.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Learners have different interests, experiences, capabilities and needs; they also fill a variety of life roles. Those who teach, or other-wise serve learners, must be very clear in their communication. Lack of clarity is a significant issue for public education<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>First, I looked for a PEI definition, the kind of definition the Minister might use when speaking to retirees or the local Chamber of Commerce. I did not find one, however, the Education Act describes education as “the process of imparting or acquiring knowledge.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I like it but find” knowledge” a bit narrow for 2023. In addition to knowledge, we need to acquire “skills, attitudes and other attributes” needed for the years ahead. We also need to share the definition widely.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Next comes the kind of help that learners need; here’s my short list:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li4">counselling,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li4">instruction,</li>
  <li class="li4"> learning products and technology.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li4">assessment,</li>
  <li class="li4">And others<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p>Then comes an organization “to encourage, support and regulate the services.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Turns out that, in spite of our rhetoric, Provinces operate school systems rather than education systems; developing an education system should be a priority.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Readers interested in public education may find the following of interest:</p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li4">OECD,</li>
  <li class="li4">World Bank, Report 208</li>
  <li class="li4">Montreal Economic Institute</li>
  <li class="li4">OECD – Education 2030</li>
</ul>
<p>It is interesting to note recent changes in the senior Department management; restructuring is likely to bring about desire changes.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
<p>Don Glendenning</p>
