<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0.14in"><span lang="en-US">It
is widely recognized that the level and quality of education is key
to our future as individuals, families, communities and countries. 
There is also a widely held view that the education system we now
have is unlikely to provide the education our people need, especially
our young people.  There is a widespread call for change from many
quarters, including educators, employers, and the public at large. 
One of those calls is for increased involvement, no increased
engagement, of the public in the development and delivery of
education and educational services.</span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">During the past year, our cities
witnessed a number of occupations; the reasons may be obscure and
open to interpretation but the unease between governors and the
governed, between citizens and their institutions, is evident; some
would even say that the two are estranged. During the same period,
the writer has engage many Islanders in discussions about education
and here, also, exists a significant divide between providers and
users of educational services, while concern exists about all levels
of education, most people engaged me in conversations about the
public school system.  And, while I have not read widely on the
subject, I find it to be of concern among governments in other
countries as well.  Even when decision makers seek the views of
others affected by their decision, those consulted often feel that
they are being manipulated.</p>

<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0.14in"><span lang="en-US"><b>What
is Public engagement?</b></span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Public engagement refers to the is the
interaction of specialists  with the public in in the decision making
process.  Typically, specialists consult, that is, they arrange
opportunities for the public to make its views known about a matter
under development.  But the public has become quite cynical about the
consultation process viewing it simply as an exercise in public
relations.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">But people want more than simply being
consulted, they want to engage in the setting of policies and the
making of decision.  The current term for this kind or level of
participation is “public engagement”.  It results in putting more
decision-making powers directly into the hands of ordinary people –
it is really grass roots democracy in action.  Public engagement
starts with the setting of the agenda, working from shared
information, a transparent agenda, and ensuring inclusiveness,
control and transparency.</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><span lang="en-US">Wikipedia has
identified nine principles of public engagement:</span></p>
<ol>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in">“Participants should join those
	organising the process in setting <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terms_of_reference" name="Terms of reference"><u>terms
	of reference</u></a> for the whole exercise, and framing the
	questions that they will discuss.</p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in">The group organising, or in
	overall control of, the process should be broad based, including
	stakeholders with different interests on the subject being
	discussed.</p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in">There should be a diversity of
	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information" name="Information"><u>information</u></a>
	sources and perspectives available to participants.</p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in">There should be space for the
	perspectives of those participants who lack specialist knowledge of
	the area concerned to engage in a two-way exchange with those
	possessing specialist knowledge.</p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in">There should be complete
	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transparency_%28behavior%29" name="Transparency (behavior)"><u>transparency</u></a>
	of the activities carried out within the process to those both
	inside and outside it.</p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Those without a voice in
	policy-making should be enabled to use the consultation process as a
	tool for positive <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Political_change&action=edit&redlink=1" name="Political change (page does not exist)"><u>political
	change</u></a>. This should be embedded in the process by
	sufficient funds being made available for follow-up work after their
	initial conclusions have been reached.</p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in">The process should contain
	safeguards against decision-makers using a process to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legitimise" name="Legitimise"><u>legitimise</u></a>
	existing assumptions or policies.</p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in">All groups involved in the process
	should be given the opportunity to identify possible strategies for
	longer-term learning, development and change on a range of issues
	relating to their conclusions.</p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in">The group organising, or in
	overall control of, the process should develop an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audit" name="Audit"><u>audit</u></a>
	trail through the process, to explain whether policies were changed,
	what was taken into account, what criteria were applied when
	weighing up the evidence from the process, and therefore how the
	views of those involved in the participatory process may have made a
	difference. This should be explored together with as many those
	involved in all levels of the process as possible.”</p></li>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><span lang="en-US"><b>Benefits:</b></span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">The benefits of public engagement
include 
</p>
<ul>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Fosters better communication</p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Generates broader viewpoints</p></li>

</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">As one would expect,
public engagement in education occurs in a great variety of ways. 
During a recent literature scan, the writer found these to be
interesting:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p align="justify" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">
	The State of Kentucky recently reviewed and revitalized it’s
	education system using public engagement as a cornerstone of the
	change process.  
	</p></li>
	<li><p align="justify" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">
	Birmingham University in England recently appointed a Professor of
	Public Engagement.  
	</p></li>
	<li><p align="justify" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">
	One article reported the gathering of some 5,000 people in New York
	to discuss the future of Lower Manhattan.</p></li>
	<li><p align="justify" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">
	The National PTA in the USA gives a family engagement award to
	schools that engage families in significant ways in school
	activities.</p></li>

present, most information about education is initiated by and aligned
with organizations that deliver educational services including
Departments of Education, Home and School Associations, Canadian
Education Association, Teacher Federations, etc.  Writing about
education for public consumption is practically non-existent; in our
community, media coverage is generally focused on the operation of
schools.  One would find it difficult to find an article that delves
into the intricacies of teaching, diagnosing, measuring progress,
standards, curriculum, etc.  Yet, such programs exist in many other
fields especially health and the law. </span>
