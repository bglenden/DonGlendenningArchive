<div class="reader-summary">Letter critiquing PEI education terminology and organizational structure. Points out that Department of Education describes role narrowly as &quot;developing and delivering curriculum&quot; rather than helping people gain skills. Notes that PEI replaced &quot;education&quot; with &quot;school&quot; in legislation, limiting systemic scope. Urges Department to clarify and republish its mission.</div>

<div class="reader-content">
<p>Dear Editor:</p>
<p>A clarity issue</p>
<p>Education is a large and complex service to Islanders; it also appears to have a a clarity issue; some examples:</p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li1">The Department of Education describes its role as one of “developing and delivering curriculum to Island youth”. While the Department <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>certainly does that, the statement misses the greater role of helping people gain skills, knowledge and other attributes needed thrive in the year ahead.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Preparing and delivering curriculum does not capture what the Department does nor expected to do.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></li>
  <li class="li1">A second example is that of “helping young people to secure a place” in society. People fill a variety of life roles;” education” helps them to“develop skills, knowledgesttitudes<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>and other attributes to do so.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>‘Securing a meaningful place” doesn’t capture what schools do; neither is it sufficient to design a program or measure results.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li1">I learned recently that PEI replaced “education” in the Act with ‘’school”; seems we now have a school system rather than an “education system”. My rading of the literature suggests that education elsewhere is strengthening education offerings.</li>
  <li class="li1">Most Government Departments seem to organize Departments around functions and Branches; we seem, instead, to hav organized around levels instead.</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p>The above are based on a search of PEI education literature. Assuming they are accurate, I urge the Department therefore, to take steps now to and republish.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
<p><br></p>
