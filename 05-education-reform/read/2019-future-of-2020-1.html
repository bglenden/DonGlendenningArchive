</div>

<div class="reader-summary">In this reflective planning document, Don Glendenning shares his personal journey founding Education 20/20 about a decade prior, driven by concerns about public education turmoil. He describes his vision for a broad-based organization supporting quality education for Islanders of all ages. Don candidly discusses his underestimation of educational cloistering and his evolving concern about provincial educational quality despite organizational growth in his knowledge. He acknowledges his advancing age and suggests the need for organizational changes while reaffirming commitment to current projects. The document addresses foundational questions about Education 20/20&#x27;s future direction, potential restructuring, and leadership succession.</div>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><b>About
a decade ago, I found myself becoming increasingly concerned about
the ongoing turmoil in education, especially public education and, in
consultation with others with similar concerns we founded Education
20/20 Inc.  My vision, given the size of PEI, was a broad based group
supporting  a quality education for Islanders of all ages and levels.
 Although I was cautioned, I underestimated the extent of cloistering
existing among educators.  While Education 20/20 allowed a broad area
of service, my personal interest was, and still is, improving the
quality of education for all Islanders.  </b>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><b>I
am pleased to report considerable growth in my  personal knowledge of
the operation and structure of education; growth in my understanding,
however, has actually heightened my concern about the quality of
services the Province actually delivers; current organizational
arrangements are unlikely to allow or bring about required
improvements in educational services. </b>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><b>All
this brings me to the matter of Education 20/20 Inc. while I plan to
continue with the projects we currently have and will continue to do
whatever I can for the good of the cause,</b></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><b>my
age and personal interests and limits suggest changes in our current
operation. </b>

<ol>
	<li><p lang="en-CA" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><b>Insert
	the questions we talked about today (believe Is there a need such an
	organization? Is there a role? What would be lost if Education 20/20
	disappeared? Should it be restructured? Should it be closed down?
	Should it have a new purpose, different membership, different focus?
	 How should it be led? Who should lead? Are you interested in being
	part of 20/20? Are you prepared to play a more active role?)</b></p></li>
