  D Opinion - AQUA
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">This is Don&#x27;s most comprehensive articulation of his qualification authority proposal. Using passport/visa analogy, he distinguishes credentials (what has been studied) from qualifications (what has been learned/can do). He argues these serve different purposes and shouldn&#x27;t be combined. He proposes an independent qualification authority separate from schools to certify demonstrated competencies, operating fee-for-service. Such authority would reduce teacher-sorting conflicts, focus schools on learning, support lifelong learning, and could serve all Atlantic Canada. This represents his signature contribution to education reform thinking.</div>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Passports
are issued by one’s home country, provide basic information about
the bearer and, if examined, provide some insight into the exciting
places travelled.  Visas, on the other hand, are issued by a
receiving country, involve a more detailed level of scrutiny by the
receiving country, specify the purpose of the visit and provide some
detail as to activities to be carried on; often travelers require
both a passport and visa.  
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Diplomas
and degrees share many characteristics with passports while
qualifications may be likened to visas.  They are not the same, they
serve different purposes, both may be needed and they should not be
confused.  At one time I thought the diplomas and degrees could  be
redesigned in order to attest to qualifications but I’ve changed my
mind; I now realize that credentials tell what has been studied,
qualifications tell what has been learned and, as a result, what the
holder can do.  Combining both functions in one document won’t
work, frustrates the process and the people and, in the end, is
doomed to fail.    
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Schools
are teaching institutions; their role is to help learners learn. 
Each learner decides what he or she will learn, although others,
including teachers, influence that decision.  As part of the teaching
process, teachers assess what learners have learned and, depending on
the results, design and implement new teaching strategies. 
Unfortunately and increasingly, the emphasis in school has switched
from helping learners learn to grooming them the education “race”for
a race, and even selecting winners.  The purposes are incompatible
and should be separated.  The answer is to separate the functions of
teaching and sorting.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">In
spite of my earlier comments, I believe that both learners and the
public should have and would benefit from the certification of skills
such as literacy and numeracy.  Perhaps such a service could be
provided through the apprenticeship division or perhaps certification
could be provided through existing  program infrastructure.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

<h2><span style="font-weight: normal">Another option
is to establish a new body, a qualification authority, whose sole
purpose is to evaluate and certify a person’s level of performance
on a task or set of tasks, competencies, outcomes.  Such an authority
should be independent of government and educational institutions,
have its own governing structure, operate on a fee for service basis,
accept clients on direct application or by referral, issue
certificates based on demonstrated performance, and provide
applicants with information on gaps to be filled to meet
certification requirements. </span>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">On
the other hand, perhaps we should consider we could set up a literacy
assessment , perhaps we need  A qualification authority would reduce
if not eliminate the confusion faced by teachers between teaching and
sorting, focus certification more clearly on performance that
matters, support lifelong learning and self-directed study, clearly
focus school evaluation on helping learners learn, and reduce major
for distractions for teachers caused by operating the sorting
process.  It would, in effect, have two clients, the organizations
desiring an assessment service and individuals wanting to aconfirm
their qualifications.  A qualification authority would take its cues
from the destination of the learner, focus on what a client can do
and how well, examine each skills carried and assess their
suitability  also identify gaps for the individual would not simply
administer .  A qualification authority could also play a useful role
in helping people who take on line courses convert them to a
qualification – or even the assessment of foreign credentials.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">If
establishing a qualification authority, it would make sense to
develop a service capable of serving all Atlantic Canada; it would
make an interesting new business venture and could be located on PEI.</p>
