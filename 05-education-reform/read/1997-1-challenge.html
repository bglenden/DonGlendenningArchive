  1997-1 Challenge 
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Formatted version of the 1997 Journal Pioneer letter on challenge for credit. Glendenning argues that educational institutions should enable learners to demonstrate competency through examination rather than course attendance, citing language placement testing as precedent. He envisions this approach expanding to all educational levels including arts degrees.</div>

<div class="reader-content">
<p>1997 11 26</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Editor,</p>
<p>Journal Pioneer</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Dear Sir:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Challenge for Credit</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Please allow me an opportunity to present the concept of challenging for school credits.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>As part of a degree requirement, I was required to have a reading knowledge of two languages. I</p>
<p>could meet the requirement through enrolling in language courses or taking a language exam. If</p>
<p>I was successful on the exam, I would be exempted from taking the courses. Language programs</p>
<p>often (usually ?) use tests to determine a placement level in the program; why can't the same</p>
<p>approach be used to award credit ?</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I have often wondered, furthernore, why the same approach cannot, or should not, be applied to</p>
<p>other university courses. For that matter, why not let people challenge any course for credit</p>
<p>whether that course be in school, college or university ?</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>If one examines school, college or university calendars, one finds that each course is quite clearly</p>
<p>described. In addition, I am sure that teachers have even more detailed course descriptions which</p>
<p>could be provided to a learner. Why, then, shouldn't learners be given the detailed course</p>
<p>description and allowed to study on their own, if they wish ? They could also have the option of</p>
<p>Either taking the course or writing an exam. If they pass the exam, why not give them credit ?</p>
<p>Students could use the time saved to take advanced studies or courses in other areas.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I have taken courses and am reasonably proficient in carpentry although, I must admit, I am a bit</p>
<p>rusty in some of the skills. In addition to the skills, I believe I have a reasonably good grasp of</p>
<p>the relevant background information. Certainly, I would need to bone some of the skills and</p>
<p>information especially in relation to to new construction materials. I could do some, if not all of</p>
<p>the required study on my own. I am sure that there are many other Islanders in similar positions.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>My formal qualifications do not include an arts degree although I have listened attentively, read</p>
<p>widely, discussed vigorously and written occasionally on some of the subjects included in such a</p>
<p>program. Should I, and many like me, be allowed to challenge for credits leading to a Bachelor of</p>
<p>Arts ?</p>
<p><br></p>
