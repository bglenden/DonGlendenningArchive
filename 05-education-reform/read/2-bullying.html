  2 Bullying
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Glendenning addresses school violence and bullying by first asserting that schools are not responsible for causing the problem but may have a constructive role. He identifies multiple intervention points: school policies (establishing safe learning environments), curriculum additions (conflict resolution, teamwork, communication), organizational models supporting individual learning and responsibility, and facility design/scheduling. He emphasizes the need to address fundamental questions about schools&#x27; role before implementing reactive programs, and calls for attention to environmental factors affecting behavior rather than treating symptoms alone.</div>

<div class="reader-content">
<p>The Government provides opportunity, encouragement, teachers and other resources to assist students</p>
<p>to obtain a quality education but only learners can learn. lt is a responsibility of learners, or their</p>
<p>parents, to ensure that learners take advantage of the resources. Teachers certainly play a role in</p>
<p>motivating students" Students make individual decisions about if what, when, how and how much they</p>
<p>learn; even when we are teaching, learners may be learning something quite different from what is</p>
<p>intended"</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>As for transportation, there are at last two separate points of decision-making. People providing the bus</p>
<p>service, or the operators themselves, should decide whether or not it is safe to drive. lf conditions are</p>
<p>unsafe, buses should stay off the road and students along the route should be informed of the change of</p>
<p>plans. Even when buses are operating, parents are the ones to decide each day whether or not their</p>
<p>child gets on the bus. lf bus transportation is not available, a parent may arrange alternative</p>
<p>transportation if they know the school is open.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Frequently I am asked if the above policies will not result in some students being ahead or behind others</p>
<p>and if the gap will widen. This implies that students in the same grade are at the same level of</p>
<p>achievement and move forward in a lock-step fashion. This is far from the case. ln any class, some</p>
<p>students are ahead and others behind the average - whatever average means. The system copes with</p>
<p>students who lose a day due to illness, why can't it also cope with a student who loses a day due to bad</p>
<p>weather? Granted the number of absentees may be larger on a storm day, but the problem remains</p>
<p>essentially the same.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Closing schools on stormy days is administratively convenient but I believe is disruptive to students and</p>
<p>learning. The decision to attend or not attend on any given day belongs to the student and/or parents. I</p>
<p>am quite satisfied that teachers are both willing and able to deal with school absences in a less</p>
<p>disruptive fashion. .</p>

<p>Dear Sir:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Bullying</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Bullying and violence in our schools seerns to be on the increase and I am greatly disturbed by the trend.</p>
<p>Schools cannot and should not be blamed for this development; neither are they responsible for fixing</p>
<p>the problem. They ffi?y, however, have a role to play, and I know that some schools have implemented</p>
<p>activities and programs to deal with the issue.</p>
<p>It seems to me that we need to deal with some fundamental questions around the issue: Do schools</p>
<p>have any responsibility for reducing or eliminating violence on school premises? lf the answer is yes,</p>
<p>school policies may be required or need review. Some schools, maybe all, already have such policies. lf</p>
<p>not, they can be developed. The policy may be as simple as "Each school will provide an environment</p>
<p>that is safe for learners and conducive to learning". Some changes may be required in school rules and</p>
<p>regulations. Ask your principal about policies for your school.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Some curriculum changes may also be needed. Perhaps more attention should be given to studies in</p>
<p>conflict resolution, team work, communications, etc. lf we decide that safe schools are important and</p>
<p>the curriculum is full, some of the current subjects may have to be replaced.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>We should examine also how schools are organized to see if there are alternative delivery models which</p>
<p>better address the issue of violence. There are some who would argue that the current model is not the</p>
<p>most supportive of individual learning, team work, responsibility, self-discipline, etc. There certainly are</p>
<p>other models which can provide equivalent academic results. Results from schools operating on other</p>
<p>models should be readily available.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Finally, one must ask whether the facilities and schedules contribute to violence. Certainly rigid</p>
<p>scheduling and the development of individual responsibility are at odds but that is not to say that rigid</p>
<p>scheduling causes violence. A different approach, however, may help.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I do not know the answer to the question of school violence but I believe that we owe it to our young</p>
<p>people to provide the best and safest learning environment that we can. And we should start now.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
