  4 Reading Opinion piecel-1
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Dated May 22, 2013, this letter to Charlottetown Guardian editor expresses Don&#x27;s public advocacy for reading improvement as key skill. He articulates concern about reading&#x27;s state through parents paying both taxes and private tuition, children reading below grade level, employers seeking skilled workers, and seniors endangered by inability to read medicine labels. Don challenges complacency, noting 42 percent of Canadian adults lack sufficient literacy for modern employment. Rather than assigning blame to systemic causes (literacy silos, staffing, resources, curriculum), he advocates for expert problem-solving, citing British Columbia&#x27;s appointment of a Superintendent of Reading. Don calls reading a pandemic problem and literacy &quot;the most valuable of school subjects,&quot; emphasizing most people can learn to read with proper support. He positions himself as inviting feedback (standards2020@gmail.com) and advocates trusting educators&#x27; expertise while addressing coordination gaps among providers (school system, post-secondary, community organizations). The piece reflects Don&#x27;s public engagement on education issues and practical problem-solving orientation.</div>

the key skill</b></p>
<p lang="en-US" style="font-weight: normal"><br />

</p>
<p lang="en-US" style="font-weight: normal"><br />

</p>
<p lang="en-US" style="font-weight: normal">Concern
about the state of reading is widespread.  Parents and grandparents
paying both taxes and private school tuition, parents with children
reading below grade level, employers seeking or just having hired
skilled workers and seniors whose health is endangered by their
inability to read labels on medicine bottles.  Then there are the
hard statistics; 42 percent of adult Canadians not sufficiently
literate to hold employment in a modern economy and a static
literacyrate for the past decade in spite of significant investment. 
</p>
<p lang="en-US" style="font-weight: normal"><br />

</p>
<p lang="en-US" style="font-weight: normal">Some
people ask  where the fault lies; I don’t know and even if we knew,
fixing the blame doesn’t solve the problem.  The fault may lie in
the literacy silos, that is the variety of agencies providing
literacy training but re;porting through different agencies, the
Department of Education, Department of advanced education, Holland
College, UPEI, and several other agencies. Or it could be staff,
learning resources, class time, counseling.  Or it could be
vocabulary, fluency, ability to decode or any one of a number of
causes.</p>
<p lang="en-US" style="font-weight: normal"><br />

</p>
<p lang="en-US" style="font-weight: normal">I
believe the reading problem is pandemic; if it were a health problem
we would call out or chief medical officer,  In education?  Announce
a new initiative and hope people will forget about it.  British
Columbia has appointed a Superintendent of reading.A more effective
approach, I suggest is to ask the people in the trenches; or
betterstill, give them the task and get out of their way.</p>
<p lang="en-US" style="font-weight: normal"><br />

</p>
<p lang="en-US" style="font-weight: normal">I
believe that most people can learn to read, literacy generally and
reading in particular is the most valuable of school subjects, and
well honed reading skills are tools of lifelong learning.

solution to our meeting the needs of Islanders is known; we simply
need to seek it out from those who teach.  Harness their expertise
and harness their energy  
</p>
<p lang="en-US" style="font-weight: normal"><br />

</p>
<p lang="en-US" style="font-weight: normal">Historically,
the public school system has been the first line of attack on
literacy; there is increasing recognition, however, that early
childhood is a the most critical time.  At the same time, our post
secondary students find it necessary to provide literacy training for
recent graduates as well as well as drop outs.  All this, it appears
to be an expensive duplication of services.</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="font-weight: normal">the
mother ouring the past few months I’ve talked about education with
Islanders, teachers, retired teachers and the public at large, from
Souris to Alberton and, invariably, they expressed concern about
reading.  And literacy is a frequent subject in our local media
whether it be the Raise A Reader initiative, the work of the PEI
literacy Alliance, initiatives by the Atlantic Ministers of
Education, or the need for skilled workers.  Reading
is a community problem; it cannot be solved by schools alone. While
informal reports suggest that reading levels in schools are
improving, much remains to be done.  Raising
the reading levels of our citizens is a major undertaking and one
worthy of our support.  
</p>
<p lang="en-US" style="font-weight: normal"><br />

</p>
<p lang="en-US" style="font-weight: normal">When
one learns, one changes behaviour; in simple terms, learning results
in a change in attitude, skill and knowledge and often a combination
of the three.  We recognize that learning to read, and learning to
read better, occurs in the context of learning to communicate
generally and includes learning to listen, to write and to speak.  We
also believe, however, that it is important to understand each
component separately, and have limited this paper to an examination
of reading from a learner’s perspective.

do readers do?</b></p>
<p lang="en-US" style="font-weight: normal"><br />

</p>
<p lang="en-US" style="font-weight: normal">Based
on the view that reading ability reflects what one can do and how
well one can do it, I searched for and found a number of lists of
reading outcomes, competencies, skills or expectations; none were as
complete or comprehensive as  I had hoped.  The Atlantic Provinces
cooperate on curriculum and the website for the Department of
Education and early Childhood Development publishes curriculum guides
for all high school subjects.  I am not sure which guide best suits
our purposes but, on the assumption that reading competencies or
skills at the PEI Grade 12 level and those of adults would be roughly
the same, I opted to include in this paper the reading and viewing
component of the Language Arts graduation expectations.  (Readers are
also encouraged to visit the PEI Department of Education website).
