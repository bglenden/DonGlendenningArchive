  2020 Puzzled about math
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Incomplete working draft from Don&#x27;s ongoing mathematics education investigation combining conversations, educator discussions, instructional material examination, competency identification, and articles. Don reflects on education broadly and notes the World Bank&#x27;s 2018 report suggesting Ministries of Education have become part of the education problem. He expresses suspicion about grade-organized math skills lists given classroom reality showing four- to six-level grade variation. Document cuts off but indicates concerns about lack of oversight, external expertise involvement, and citizen consultation in math curriculum.</div>

<p>2020-Math</p>
<p>Editor</p>
<p>Puzzled about math</p>
<p>As readers may recall, I’ve been exploring the matter of math education in PEI; exploration has included many conversations over cups of coffee, discussions with math educators, examination of instructional material, identification of citizen math competencies and reading articles along the way.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>None of that makes me a mathematician but it certainly makes me more comfortable in what I am about to say.</p>
<p>First a word about education; in my view, we are all educated, all could use more education; we get that education by learning, by improving, adding and changing skills, knowledge and attitudes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Communities know that raising level of education is good for the individual and for the community in which they live, so communities, through their government provide encouragement and support. Unfortunately, as the World Bank points out in their 2018 report, Ministries of Education have now come part of the education problem.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Now to mathematics.</p>
<p>As I write, I have beside me a half-dozen analyses and lists of math skills, outcomes and competencies; I am immediately suspicious when I find them organized by grade hen my own<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>experience sugsts in any class student grades likely vary by ffour to six levels</p>
<p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Since I recall teachers poin out</p>
<p>Above are not new. No one seems to be in charge, commit to review</p>
<p>Outsid experts</p>
<p>No conversation with citizens</p>
