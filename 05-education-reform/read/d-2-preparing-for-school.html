  D-2 Preparing  for school
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Don challenges the concept of young children &quot;preparing for school,&quot; questioning whether 4-6 year-olds should adapt to schools or whether schools should adapt to developmental stages. He argues that other institutions (churches, doctors&#x27; offices, farms) accommodate visiting children, so why not schools? This letter reflects a child-centered educational philosophy and questions whether rigid school preparation demands are developmentally appropriate. While Don notes this isn&#x27;t his expertise area, he suggests schools have greater obligation to adapt their practices to childhood development than children have to pre-adapt to institutional structures.</div>

<p>Dear Sir:</p>
<p><b>chools have it backwardsSchool alignment<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></b></p>
<p>Should kids prepare for church, a visit to the doctor or a visit to a farm or should schools , doctor’s officesa and farms prepare for kids? <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>New Zealsnd seems to think that students should prepare fpr schools <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>(New Zealand Herald, June 23, 2015, “Half of NZ kids not adequately prepared for school”)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I know that we talk about students preparing for work or ofor post secondary education.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But 4, 4, or 6 year olds preparing for school seems a bit much</p>
<p>At that argee, it seems that it is the school that needs to adapt.</p>
<p>Then again, it is not my area of expertise.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p><br></p>
