  1 Education and Instruction
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Blog post introducing Don&#x27;s online presence and establishing his fundamental distinction between education and instruction. He defines education broadly as experiences with formative effect on thinking, feeling, and behavior (occurring anywhere, anytime), while schooling/instruction is more limited, involving teacher-directed learning in schools. Don expresses puzzlement that educators frequently use these terms interchangeably and suspects some deliberately create confusion. He commits to keeping blog posts short and education-focused while inviting reader comments. The post demonstrates his intention to reach broader audiences beyond formal publications and his concern about conceptual clarity in educational discourse. His accessible, conversational tone in this medium contrasts with his more academic occasional papers.</div>

<p><b>Education and instruction</b></p>
<p>Welcome to Don’s Posts.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I’ve had some instruction on how to post my blogs and am hoping to become a regular. I also plan to keep my posts short, and focused mostly on education.</p>
<p>My definition of education is a broad one; education refers to “experiences that have a formative effect on the way a person thinks, feels and acts” – whenever, wherever and however they came about.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Schooling, or instruction, is more limited and is usually equated with receiving instruction under the direction of teachers in schools. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I must admit that I am puzzled by the fact that so many educators use the terms interchangeably; some friends, more cynical than I. believe that educators use the terms interchangeably just to confuse us.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>I welcome your comments and hope you’ll return for Blog No. 2 when I plan to share my newest significant educational insight.</p>
