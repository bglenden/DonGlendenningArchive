  A  Education
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">A foundational letter defining education as the lifelong learning process through which people close the gap between limited birth knowledge and extensive survival/thriving knowledge. Don characterizes education as the culmination of learning-driven changes and adjustments, evident in what people know, can do, value, and how they act. He defines good education as enabling people to address issues encountered in daily life. The letter positions education as outcome (accumulated knowledge/capability) rather than process alone, distinct from schooling (which Don promises to address separately). This brief but philosophically grounded piece represents Don&#x27;s foundational understanding of education&#x27;s nature.</div>

<p>Dear Editor:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><b>About Education</b></p>
<p>Education is important; it is also complex. There are many ways to describe it; a common understanding is important. Here’s my take on the subject.</p>
<p>We do not know very much when we are born but we must know a great deal to survive and even more to thrive; learning is the process a person goes through to close the gap.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The result of what we learn is our education; it is a culmination of changes and adjustments brought about through learning . People demonstrate the nature and level of their education by what they know, can do, what they value, how they act, etc.</p>
<p>A good education is sometimes described as one that enables a person to deal with the issues they encounter in their daily lives.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Schooling is a different matter; I’ll write about schools in<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>future letter.</p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
<p>Don Glendenning</p>
