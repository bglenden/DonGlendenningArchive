  D focus on learning and teaching
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">From December 1, 2010, Don articulates his educational philosophy by examining three variables at the learning-teaching interface: learners with varied readiness, teachers with unique personalities and professional skills, and circumstances (resources, scheduling, testing) largely beyond teacher control. He identifies the core improvement lever: increasing successful learning experiences for every student. He emphasizes that real improvement occurs only when the essential teacher-learner interaction improves, dismissing administrative tinkering as insufficient.</div>

<b>It’s time to focus on
learning and teaching</b></p>
<p align="center" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">The
solution to improving education is to focus on schools and, within
our schools, to focus on the point where learner and teacher meet.
There are several variables at play, the learner, the teacher, and
the situation in which they meet.  There are three factors to
consider.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"> As
for the learner, it would be great if every learner came to the
teaching-learning interface rested, well fed, feeling confident, with
the encouragement of interested parents, home work completed, a
reading level appropriate for the age,  and an interest in learning,
but that is not always the case and is not likely ever to be the
case.  Unlike a medical doctor, who sees one patient at a time,
teachers deal with 25 or more people with all their degrees of
uniqueness. But that is the reality faced by each teacher each time a
teacher and student meet.  
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">A
teacher is a second factor and, like the rest of us, each teacher is
a unique personality.  To the learning teaching interface, a teacher
brings unique personal characteristics but also a set of professional
skills in support of their role as teacher.  Professional skills
include those of diagnosing learning needs and barriers, creating
activities conducive to learning, selection and preparation of
support materials, prescribing learning activities, testing and
assessment and others.  The role of a teacher is to help learners
change their behaviour, to change or develop new attitudes, skills
and knowledge.   
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">The
circumstances under which learner and teacher meet, the micro level,
are, by and large, outside the control of the professional teacher. 
By circumstances, I refer to books and reference material, time of
day, teacher student contact time, location, availability of
resources for the task at hand, testing and examination schedules,
independent study, standards to be met,   
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">The
essence of teaching occurs when teacher and learner meet.  We need,
therefore, to increase the number of successful learning experiences
of every student.  When that happens, and only when that happens,
will schools improve.</p>
