  2015 The myth of grade levels
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">A refined version of his grade-level critique, Don clarifies that while different levels exist within subjects (Grade 9 math vs. advanced mathematics), these levels should not correspond to age or years in school. He highlights apprenticeship, music, and swimming as better models where levels are set by external bodies and recognized across jurisdictions. Don proposes PEI establish a qualification framework identifying subject levels independent of age, potentially creating national and international portability. He positions this as an opportunity for PEI to &quot;break new ground&quot; in education innovation.</div>

<p>Editor,</p>

<p>Charlottetown, PEI	</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Dear Sir:</p>
<p><b>Myth of grade levels<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>School grade levels are an administrative convenience and nothing more; grade nine math is a myth – but so also is college or university math, and the same may be said for other subjects.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That’s not to say that there aren’t different levels of a subject, it’s just that a level has nothing to do with the age of the person studying it.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Apprenticeship has it right.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>An apprentice may be in a second, third or fourth year of an apprenticeship and earns each designation through studies, exam results and experiences; grade levels in music and swimming are set by bodies other than schools and are recognized across the country.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Levels of math, and other subjects, should stand separate from years of schooling and separate from one’s age; levels come from analysis of the subject or field, and could mean the same thing anywhere in Canada, perhaps anywhere in the world.<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Levels should be there for people who need or want to know where they stand, whether for their own satisfaction, to enter further study or employment, and should be available to people of any age not just for the young.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>PEI could take the lead, break new ground so to speak, in establishing a qualification framework for identifying levels of math, and perhaps other subjects as well. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Don Glendenning</p>
<p>A long-time student of education</p>
