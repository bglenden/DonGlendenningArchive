</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Email notification from Bill Whelan regarding continuation of Education 20/20 Inc.&#x27;s 2016 Annual General Meeting held July 20 in Charlottetown. Five members were present but lacked quorum, so two motions were submitted for electronic vote by deadline July 26, 2016: approval of 2016 budget and retention/modification of current officers. Message requests members vote FOR, AGAINST, or ABSTAIN on each motion and respond to all. Don Glendenning&#x27;s role as President continues through this governance procedure.</div>
