<p>Dear Mr. Daley:		</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>This is a follow-up to our telephone conversations about the need for change in education and our efforts to make change happen.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I cannot overstate the importance of education both for individuals and for the future of our community and country.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Doing more of the same is not an answer; we need a fundamental change in thinking about what constitutes an education and the role of schools.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We know at least some of the steps that must be taken, more autonomy for schools, less bureaucracy, greater freedom and accountability for teachers, more attention to the preschool years, greater choice among providers and changes in standards and reporting. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The attached copies of my last two letters to the Editor may be of interest.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Since my original letter (attached) I am pleased to report that Education 20/20 Inc.:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li8">Has convened a workshop on Early Childhood Education.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A panel of practitioners shared their views and experiences on approaches that work; participants included other early childhood workers, parents, educators and members of the community at large.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Education 20/20 Inc. plans to offer workshops in other Island communities in the months ahead.</li>
  <li class="li8">Plans to test a new software package, developed in Canada, on the nature and extent of engagement activities during day to day activities.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We believe such a test to be timely in view of the evidence that engagement results in better student grades. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li8">Will make an award to an Island school that best exemplifies the concept of engagement in its day to day activities.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Criteria and procedures are now under development.</li>
  <li class="li8">Has begun the process of engaging educators, especially decision makers, in a regular dialogue about educational issues, with the level of reading skills of high school graduates being at the top of our list.</li>
  <li class="li8">Is exploring ways to gather and disseminate information on education to the public probably through some combination of electronic, print and social media.</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Our group cannot make this happen alone; we are now looking for partners and supporters.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We have set a program budget of $25,000 to carry out the above initiatives in 2013.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>While all contributions will be appreciated, a three year commitment would assist with long range planning.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>We are pleased to be able to say that the Community Foundation of Prince Edward Island supports our work and has agreed to administer our funds.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Contributions, therefore, to<b> Education 20/20 Inc</b>. should be directed to the Community Foundation of Prince Edward Island, 119 Queen Street, Charlottetown, PE<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>C1A 4B3, who will issue charitable receipts.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I thank you in advance for your consideration and would welcome an opportunity to meet, to hear you’re your ideas and concerns about education, and to provide further information about opportunities for financial support.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>With best wishes for the holiday season.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
<p><br></p>
