  12 Funding
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Proposing that school funding should mirror post-secondary models—combining base institutional grants with enrollment-driven funds reflecting student choice—Glendenning argues this would improve accountability without increasing total spending. He advocates dividing school budgets into a guaranteed portion and an enrollment-contingent portion, such that schools gain or lose revenue based on attracting students. This market-based approach would require schools to respond to community preferences while preserving universal public education. It reflects his consistent theme of introducing accountability through choice.</div>

<p>Dear Editor:</p>
<p>Funding</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>It is a given that education is important to the well-being of our country and its citizens; one</p>
<p>recent report points out that, in spite of substantial increases during the past few years, Canada</p>
<p>still lags in investment in this area. Without doubt, even though enrolment is declining,</p>
<p>increased funding is still required to both keep abreast and to-make improvements - but just</p>
<p>increasing grants is not sufficient.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I have often observed how little choice there is in our education system especially in the early</p>
<p>years; it seems that we can have a choice for practically everyone who serves us except for</p>
<p>those who teach our children. I was interested, therefore, to read a number of articles earlier</p>
<p>this year pointing to a growing body of evidence that supports school choice as an instrument</p>
<p>for educationa I improvement.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>ln my view, the issues of funding and choice converge at the postsecondary level where an</p>
<p>institution's income results from two separate decisions. One is the decision by the government</p>
<p>to make a grant to a school; the other is the decisions of a student to choose one institution</p>
<p>over another. Both trigger revenue to the institution and establish the operating budget. lt is</p>
<p>time to apply the same principle to funding our public schools.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>ln a nutshell, I am suggesting that Government continue to pay the full cost of public school</p>
<p>education, but that the grant to a school be in two parts. The major grant would flow directly to</p>
<p>a school as it does today. The remainder of a school's funding would be enrolment driven and</p>
<p>would result from a student's choice of one school rather than another. Gaining or losing a</p>
<p>student would impact on a schools overall budget.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Having to respond to market changes is normal in our society and would, in my view, have a</p>
<p>positive impact on the public school system.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
<p><br></p>
