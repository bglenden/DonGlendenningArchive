  -educ vs school
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Drawing on a 2018 World Bank report, Don emphasizes the distinction between &quot;going to school&quot; and &quot;gaining an education.&quot; He provides three evidence-based reasons: (1) Time in school is unreliable as a learning measure; better to set standards and allow time to meet them; (2) Education comprises multiple services—information, instruction, counseling, assessment, learning products, technology—most offered anywhere, while &quot;going to school&quot; is not itself an educational service (analogous to hospital or shopping plaza); (3) PEI&#x27;s department title &quot;Education and Lifelong Learning&quot; seems redundant since education includes lifelong learning. Don notes that instructional services benefit from centralized locations, while non-instructional services (information, counseling) may serve better if decentralized. He proposes a lexicon of common educational terms, supporting his broader call for definitional clarity.</div>

<p>Editor</p>
<p>Dear sir</p>
<p>D-22-03</p>
<p>Education or schooling</p>
<p>A World Bank<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>report in 2018 on education<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>reminded developing countries that going to school and gaining an education are not the same thing; the difference needs to be affirmed in PEI as well. Some reasons for that conclusion include:</p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li1">Given that individuals learn at their own rate, the length of time one has been in school is not a very reliable measure of how much one has learned. The alternative is ti set a standard and allow students time to meet it.</li>
  <li class="li1">Education is typically comprised of a number of services - <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>information, instruction, counselling, assessment, learning products and technology, etc; most can be offered most anywhere. Some services require special facilities and groups.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But going to school is not itself an educational service.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I liken a school to a hospital or shopping plaza.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li1">I’m puzzld by the title “Education and Lifelong learning” in the name of the Department; doesn’t education already include lifelong learning?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
</ul>
<p>Certainly instructional<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>services usually benefit from being in a single location; non-instructional services such as Information and counselling , however, may serve equally well or even better<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>if located off campus used by the Department of Education</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>A lexicon of common educational terms may be in order</p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
<p><br></p>
