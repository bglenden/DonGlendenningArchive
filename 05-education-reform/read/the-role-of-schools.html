  The role of schools
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Don identifies three key roles for schools emerging from an Education 20/20 workshop: developing young people to their full potential, helping the Island develop needed human capital, and providing care while parents work. He notes that acceptance of the &quot;care&quot; function may have contributed to social promotion and declining diploma value. This foundational letter clarifies Don&#x27;s belief that clarity about institutional roles must precede other reforms, reflecting his systematic approach to education policy.</div>

<p>Dear Sir:</p>
<p><b>The role of schools</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>The role of schools was the first issue raised in a recent workshop hosted by Education 20/20 in Stratford; from their reaction, it is obvious that many in the audience were unsure.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Here’s my take on the issue:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Most people would agree, I think, that one role of schools is to help young Islanders develop to their full potential.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The public generally expect schools to also help the Island community develop the people needed to secure its future.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>There’s a publicly unstated view that providing safe and supportive care for children while parents work is also a role of schools..</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Some would argue that the acceptance by schools of the function of “care” has led to social promotion and the declining value of school diplomas.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Once we agree on roles, dealing with the next issues should be easy.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
