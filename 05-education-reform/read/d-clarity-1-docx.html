<p><b>Dear Editor:</b></p>
<p><b>About Education</b></p>
<p><b>Doc5/Hand</b></p>
<p><b>Education is complex. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Learners have different interests, capabilities, experiences and needs; They also fill a number of life roles, that of an Individual, family member, citizen, student, consumer and producer; education is needed or may help with any and all.</b></p>
<p><b>Education is also an umbrella word; a person’s education includes all the experiences that have changed a life and is demonstrated by our actions; Our education depends, to a large degree, on our experiences at home, in our community, at school, through travel, interactions with others, personal exploration and roles we play in life. A good education has been described as one that provides a person with the knowledge, skills. attitudes and other attributes needed to deal with circumstances that confront us in our- everyday lives; but there are other definitions as well<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>An education system consists of programs and services put in place to support learners and learning; typical tools of change include information, instruction; diagnosis, counselling, quality control, products and technology.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b>Schools are an important component of any education system; they focus on instruction.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Attendance of the young is required by law. Like a hospital or spa, schools are purpose-built facilities that house the people and services needed to support education. Having a well-equipped school is important but it is the experiences within that school that impacts one’s education. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b>It is said that education should help us develop the attitudes. skills, knowledge and other attributes that will allow us to thrive in later life. To borrow a phrase from a sister Province, each child should leave school “having mastered the tools to (continue to) learn”.</b></p>
<p><b>Sincerely</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
