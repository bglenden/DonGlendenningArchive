  Role of Dept ito1
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Dated March 9, 2025, Don expands on role definition, arguing many Islanders (including educators) confuse education with schooling. World Bank research cautions against this conflation. Education encompasses all learning—at home, school, church, play, work—developing knowledge, skills, attitudes, and values. Oregon&#x27;s Department of Public Instruction identifies six life roles: individual, family member, student, worker, and citizen (five of six listed). Don critiques PEI&#x27;s narrow departmental self-description: &quot;developing and delivering curriculum&quot; to young Islanders. He proposes the government&#x27;s role is better described as &quot;encouraging, supporting and regulating&quot; education for all Islanders across all contexts—home, school, work, community—not just youth in schools. This represents a comprehensive reconceptualization of government&#x27;s educational mandate.</div>

<p>										March 9. 2025</p>
<p>Dear Editor:</p>
<p>					Role of Department of Education</p>
<p>We should talk about education; some people, including educators, confuse it with schooling. The World Bank ( <span class="Apple-converted-space">      </span>) cautioned developing countries about confusing the two.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Education is about all you learn - at home, at school, at church, at play, at work - knowledge, skills and attitudes.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The Oregon state Department of public Instruction identifies six life roles – individual, family member, student, worker and citizen education contributes to one’s success in all.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>as one of “developing and delivering curriculum” to young Islanders. I know that the Department does that but find “developing and delivering” to be a narrow view of the process.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Neither should services be limited to “young people” or those in school.</p>
<p>Seems to me that the role Government is better described as one of “encouraging, supporting and regulating” education for all Islanders,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>whether this be at home, school, work or elsewhere In the community.</p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
<p>Don Glendenning</p>
