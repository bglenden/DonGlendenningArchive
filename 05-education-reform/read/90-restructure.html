  90 Restructure
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Article No. 90 (April 15, 2020) addresses post-COVID educational impacts, anticipating long-term changes rather than &quot;return to normal.&quot; Don notes Australian post-secondary institutions facing decimated budgets from lost regional students and uncertainty about their return, while endowments supporting disadvantaged students recover slowly. He predicts employers may shift from credentials to qualifications and from education products to services. The piece outlines seven structural systemic elements needed: overarching beliefs framework, service-based organization (listing leadership, information/counselling, funding, products, instruction, human resources, quality assurance), distinguishing education from schooling, service-industry culture, autonomy-accountability joint application, professional independence, and de-politicization. Don criticizes conflating education with schooling, noting this distorts schools&#x27; role, increases costs, and bureaucratizes services.</div>

	It’s
	been a trying winter; I’m looking forward to sunny days and some
	time in my garden. The media is full of stories about parents,
	students and teachers coping with closed schools and self
	confinement. Some even talk about a return to normal.  But I, for
	one, expect the coronavirus pandemic to have a long term impact on
	education with normal eing a long way off.</p>

	Post
	secondary institutions are bearing the brunt of change, budgets of

	encourage and support the education of its citizens. Typical

	1.	Over-arching
	beliefs - that set a framework for planning, developing and
	implementing educational services. Such a document would inform the
	public, set the tone, increase consistency and reduce red tape
	throughout the system.</p>
	<p align="justify" style="margin-right: 0.01in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%; background: #ffffff">
	2.	Organization
	of services - Education is a service industry; typical functions or
	services include leadership and governance, Information and
	counselling, funding, products and technologies, instruction, human
	re-sources and quality assurance.  Typically, the structure of
	organizations is based on the dictum “form follows function” as
	the basis for of the organizational structure. The Department seems
	to have ignored this rule.  As a result, some services appear to
	have been left out.</p>
	<p align="justify" style="margin-right: 0.01in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%; background: #ffffff">
	3.	Tendency
	to use education and schooling interchangeably Failure to
	distinguish between education and instruction; Seems strange to
	suggest that that educators are sloppy in their use of words.  I say
	this because of the practice of using education and instruction
	(schooling) interchangeably.  We do not so confuse agriculture and
	farming or health and hospitalization.  The practice results in a
	serious distortion of the role of schools, adds to the cost,
	bureaucratizes the service and is a stumbling block to improvement. 
	It is unlikely that education will become the service we deserve
	until we learn to define and describe it more clearly.</p>
	<p align="justify" style="margin-right: 0.01in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%; background: #ffffff">
	4.	Culture
	        Education is a service industry; it delivers help to
	individuals who want to change their behaviour.  Provincial
	governments pay for some educational services because they know that
	higher levels of education are good for the community s aa whole.
	Governments also support education in order that the community-ty
	has the skilled people to maintain the community as a place to live
	and work.</p>
	<p align="justify" style="margin-right: 0.01in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%; background: #ffffff">
	5.	Autonomy
	and accountability measures “jointly applied” of schools in
	their day to day decision-making. Martin Bedard, Montreal Economic
	Institute, tells us that when teachers and principals have greater
	autonomy and accountability, students generally achieve better
	grades, even when standards living are considered.”  Autonomy, it
	seems, results in higher levels of satisfaction among teachers,
	better serves students with different learning styles, the article
	also points out that the high level of pedagogical autonomy in
	Quebec increased autonomy and accountability is sometimes credited
	with higher levels of contributes to their success in national and
	international tests.  Currently limited to delivering what has been
	prescribed, in the manner prescribed.  System should decide what
	twill pay for. Techers are accountable</p>
	<p align="justify" style="margin-right: 0.01in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%; background: #ffffff">
	7.	Politicization
	  The literature supports a strong role for Departments of Education
	in encouraging and supporting education; none, however, suggested
	that Departments should actually operate school systems.    Reasons
	were not surprising and included the need for expertise not just
	leadership, short term horizon of politicians, red tape,
	polarization, political bargaining chip, adds to the fear factor,
	political appointments, every level of government,</p>
