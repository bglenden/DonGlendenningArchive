  4 Challenge
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Glendenning argues that students should be able to challenge for school, college, and university credits based on demonstrated competency through examination, following the model used in language placement testing. He advocates for published course descriptions and the option to study independently and test for credit, freeing time for advanced study. Drawing on his own experience in carpentry, he illustrates how many people possess practical knowledge and skills not reflected in formal credentials and should be allowed to formalize their learning through assessment.</div>

<p>Editor,</p>
<p>Journal Pioneer</p>
<p>Summerside, PEI</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Dear Editor:</p>
<p>Challenge for credit</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Please allow me an opportunity to present the concept of challenging for school credits.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>As part of a degree requirement, l was required to have a reading knowledge of two languages. I</p>
<p>could meet the requirement through enrolling in language courses or taking a language exam. If</p>
<p>I was successful on the exam, I would be exempted from taking the courses. Language programs</p>
<p>often (usually ?) use tests to determine a placement level in the program; why can't the same</p>
<p>approach be used to award credit ?</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I have often wondered, furthermore, why the same approach cannot, or should not, be applied to</p>
<p>other university courses. For that matter, why not let people challenge any course for credit</p>
<p>whether that course be in school, college or university ?</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>lf one examines school, college or university calendars, one finds that each course is quite clearly</p>
<p>described. ln addition, I am sure that teachers have even more detailed course descriptions which</p>
<p>could be provided to a learner. Why, then, shouldn't learners be given the detailed course</p>
<p>description and allowed to study on their own, if they wish? They could also have the option of</p>
<p>either taking the course or writing an exam. lf they pass the exam, why not give them credit?</p>
<p>Students could use the time saved to take advanced studies or courses in other areas.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I have taken courses and am reasonably proficient in carpentry although, I must admit, I am a bit</p>
<p>rusty in some of the skills. ln addition to the skills, I believe I have a reasonably good grasp of</p>
<p>the relevant background information. Certainly, lwould need to bone some of the skills and</p>
<p>information especially in relation to to new construction materials. I could do some, if not all of</p>
<p>the required study on my own. I am sure that there are many other lslanders in similar positions.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>My formal qualifications do not include an arts degree although I have listened attentively, read</p>
<p>widely, discussed vigorously and written occasionally on some of the subjects included in such a</p>
<p>program. Should l, and many like me, be allowed to challenge for credits leading to a Bachelor of</p>
<p>Arts ?</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Don Glendenning \</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
