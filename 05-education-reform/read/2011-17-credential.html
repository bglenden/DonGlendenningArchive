  2011-17 Credential
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Don distinguishes credentials (academic documents certifying program completion) from qualifications (demonstrated skills, knowledge, and attitudes for role performance). He notes diplomas and degrees rarely get used after earning and explores why they&#x27;re issued. Don argues employment advertisements list both credentials (e.g., high school diploma) and qualifications (training, experience), and observes this distinction applies to teaching (degree = credential, teaching license = qualification). He identifies public concern about standards partly stemming from conflating these concepts, with schools awarding credential &quot;folded papers&quot; that public assumes represent qualifications. He argues clarifying this distinction would improve standards discourse.</div>

<p>Dear Sir:</p>
<p>Credential or Qualification?</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>While sorting stuff in my basement recently, I came across a number of diplomas, degrees and</p>
<p>certificates. Although I remember getting them, I cannot remember ever using even one. So,</p>
<p>one wonders what purpose or purposes they serve.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Diploma, according to Wikipedia, is of Greek origin meaning a "folded paper", and is a document</p>
<p>issued by an educational institution indicating that the holder has completed a certain</p>
<p>programme of studies; degrees are also granted by educational institutions on a similar basis.</p>
<p>Degrees and diplomas are considered credentials in that they may provide entrance into an</p>
<p>arena but are not an indicator of how well one will perform once there.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>A qualification, on the other hand, speaks to the issue of attitudes, skills and knowledge</p>
<p>required to successfully perform in a role or at a task. Employment advertisements often</p>
<p>identify both a credential, such as a high school diploma, and a set of qualifications usually</p>
<p>including training and or experience. ln order to teach, one also needs a credential, a university</p>
<p>degree, and a qualification, a teaching licence, the latter attesting to one's ability to teach.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Public complaints about school standards arise, at least in part I believe, because we confuse</p>
<p>credentials and qualifications. A school's "folded paper" is a credential; the public, and</p>
<p>employers in particular, think that the "folded paper" is a qualification - and that's the rub.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Readers who view the "folded paper" in a different way will, I am sure, enlighten me at</p>
<p>standards2020@gmail.com</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
