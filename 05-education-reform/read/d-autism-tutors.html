<div class="reader-summary">Don observes private schools offering customized post-secondary programs to fill education gaps and questions why public systems don&#x27;t provide similar services. He identifies an &quot;education aftermarket&quot; need: makeup courses, grade improvements, and non-academic skill development (study skills, problem-solving, communication). Rather than critiquing private schools, he positions gap-filling as a public responsibility and advocates for expanded public sector offerings. The letter reflects Don&#x27;s belief that education systems should serve diverse learner needs throughout the lifespan.</div>

<p>Dear Sir:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>positions</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Occasionally I skim the advertisxements just to keep up on new and emerging occupations.From time to timeAmong the messages to high school graduates in the July 7, 2010 insert in the Guardian, one advertisement caught my attention.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was placed by a private school offering customized programs to students who want or need to fill education gaps.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I commend the school for providing such service but wonder why the public system doesn’t do the same. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Prior to this, I thought of the education aftermarket only in terms of updating and upgrading skills related to employment; obviously it is more than that.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Students may have missed a subject because they worked part time, some may have failed a subject, others may simply want to raise their grade from a B to an A.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In addition, students may want to improve skills that do not appear on a report card such as study skills, problem solving and communications</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>If a recent high school graduate, or an early leaver, wants help where should they turn?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The school they just left?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>College or university?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A private school?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I know that schools offer summer courses for those who have to or want to make up a subject but who helps students who only want to fill a small gap.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>There is a need for after-graduation help.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>From my perspective, filling that need is also a public school responsibility.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
<p><br></p>
