<p><b>A CALL FOR CLARITY</b></p>
<p>As a frequent participant in conversations about education, I am struck by the absence of definitions, boundaries and documentation; communication and understanding suffer as a result. For example:</p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li2">Department uses “Education and Lifelong Learning” in title; doesn’t<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>education include “lifelong learning”?</li>
  <li class="li2">Department literature refers to “helping<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>young<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>in society”; shouldn’t Department serve all Is-landers?</li>
  <li class="li2">Philosophy paper refers to helping young people to “secure a place” in society; not sure what that means or how one measures. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li2">Department refers to its goal as one of “developing and delivering programs” to young; Isn’t the role to “help people “gain skills, knowledge and attitudes needed to thrive in future years?</li>
  <li class="li2">Recent report by World Bank cautioned developing countries about treating “education” and going to school as though they are one and the same”. Aren’t we doing that also?</li>
  <li class="li2">Recently I sought the definition of” education” used in the Department only to learn that in had been dropped in a recent revision of the Education Act. Shouldn’t the Department have a definition that reflects its view?</li>
</ul>
<p>While improvement can begin in any number of places, clarification and documentation are key steps in the change process.</p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
<p>Don Glendenning</p>

<p>We need to be able to conduct community surveys to confirm that our content meets community need; we should be able to analysis PISA results to compare with community practices.</p>
<p>Education is complex; information plays a key role. Those who teach, or other-wise serve learners, must be very clear in their communication. Lack of clarity is a significant issue for<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>public education.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It must be addressed directly so that the concept of education won’t become diluted and potentially ineffective. Lack of clarity may arise form an idea itself, from the person promoting the idea or from the person receiving the idea; Lack of clarity could also signal conflicting ideas and levels of discomfort or disagreement from within the education</p>

<p>Conceptual clarity is a must to understand the people we serve, the services we provide, learner needs, product, processes and values especially when the subject carries layers of subjectivity. The Dictionary of Education (Good) defines definition as “the process of determining the definition or meaning of a word, idea or proposition in general and within a given context; the process of assigning meaning enhances both precision and clarity.”</p>
