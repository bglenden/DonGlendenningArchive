  D Changing market place
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Don observes that credentials are losing their &quot;magic&quot; and employers increasingly value actual education alongside formal credentials. He cites the University of British Columbia&#x27;s shift to &quot;broad-based admissions&quot; considering volunteer work, extracurricular activities, study abroad participation, and student engagement. Don notes that UBC seeks students likely to remain enrolled and contribute meaningfully. This letter reflects his understanding that education&#x27;s value extends beyond credential accumulation and that selective institutions increasingly recognize personal development, engagement, and practical application of learning. His observation presages current employer and university concerns about skills, character development, and demonstrated competence beyond grades.</div>

<p>Dear Sir:</p>
<p><b>Changing Marketplace for Graduates</b><b></b></p>
<p>There is an obvious change in the market place for new graduates; the diploma and degree is losing some of its magic. A new sense of realism in selection criteria can now be seen in both institutions of higher learning and employment. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Whereas a “good” school credential was all that was needed, employers and universities are interested in education as well.</p>

<p>Starting this year, the University of British Columbia will implement<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“broad-based<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>admissions” for all undergraduate programs. Has been in use in some programs now being introduce across the Vancouver campus</p>
<p>UBC wants more students who volunteer, take part in extracurricular activities, and are willing to take advantage of study abroad programs, he said. "We really want to select students who we think are going to be more inclined to engage in those things."</p>
<p>The purpose is to create a more well-rounded student body at UBC, and select students who are more likely to "stick," he said.</p>
