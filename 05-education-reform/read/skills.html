<div class="reader-summary">From April 19, 2013, Don defines skill training comprehensively: attitude, skill, and knowledge development for workplace function, including supporting academics. He distinguishes skill training from course reconfiguration, emphasizing occupational analysis as the starting point. He argues for workplace-aligned assessment criteria (quality, timeliness, safety) confirmed through demonstration rather than exams. He distinguishes credentials (what was studied) from qualifications (what someone can do) and suggests external qualification authorities may better serve skills training than educational institutions.</div>

<p>Dear Sir:</p>
<p><b>Skill Training</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>The announcement of federal funds in support of skill training is welcome news since, without federal funds, skill training would be minimal in most provinces.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But what does skill training mean? Here are some thoughts on the matter.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Skill training is not just a matter of reconfiguring courses, dropping a few and adding replacements.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Skill training is a program designed to provide people with attitudes, skills and knowledge needed to function successfully in the workplace, and includes supporting mathematics, science and communication skills.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It starts with an analysis of an occupation, identification of competencies that can be taught in a school setting, and the level needed to obtain and hold a job; this becomes the basis for what is taught and how.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The length of a program will depend, to a large degree, on each student's previous training and experience.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Skill training requires a different approach to grading or rating performance, and a different rating scale.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Performance while in training should be rated against the same criteria as those used in the field. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Grades determined by exams, or even grades that mix or average written and practical work are not good enough.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They should be replaced with criteria from the work place such as quality of work, ability to finish assigned tasks within an acceptable time frame, and to follow acceptable safety practices.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>These can and should be confirmed through demonstration, not just written tests.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>In addition to technical skills, skilled workers should be able to demonstrate good work habits, the ability to plan ahead, to work as members of a team, take responsibility for their work etc.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The culture of a skill training program is quite different from that of the typical classroom;, educational institutions offer credentials, employment requires qualifications.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A credential tells what a person has studied; a qualification tells what a person can do; not all educational institutions can manage both.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>For skills training, an external qualification authority may be a better option.</p>
<p>Finally, educational institutions need to think outside the box so let’s earmark a portion of the new funds, not for research, but for new ways to deliver training.</p>
<p>And as usual, I’d welcome your feedback at<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>HYPERLINK "mailto:standards2020@gmail.com" <span>standards2020@gmail.com</span><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
