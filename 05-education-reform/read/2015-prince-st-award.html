<span lang="en-US">The Award,
established last year by Education 20/20 through the generosity of an
Island family, includes a cheque for $2,500 and is intended to </span>call
attention to important characteristics of effective schools.  The
National Parent Teacher Association in the US points out, “when
families, schools, and communities work together student achievement
improves, teacher morale rises and communication increases”.
Study after study show the dramatic impact parental involvement makes
to a child's success in school. In fact, engaging families in their
children’s education improves school achievement, attendance,
behaviour and graduation rates.
