  D-2013-01 How do you know you learned
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Don defines learning as behavioral change across cognitive, affective, and psychomotor domains, emphasizing that learning manifests as new or improved knowledge, skills, and attitudes. He explains that learning cannot be measured directly but is evidenced through observable competencies (reading, machinery repair, design, communication). Don advocates for outcomes-based education (OBE) starting with clearly defined competencies and measurable performance levels, using physician decision-making as a model that combines objective data with professional judgment. He emphasizes this approach helps parents, teachers, and planners understand student progress and plan next steps. This letter showcases his sophisticated understanding of educational measurement and outcome-based systems.</div>

<p>Dear Sir:</p>
<p><b>How do we know that we’ve learned?</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>Any day that we learn something is a good day.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But what does learning mean and how do we know when we’ve learned? <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>To learn is to change, therefore, a learner is a person who is trying to change.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Change what? Change behaviour. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In educational terms, changes may be in the cognitive, affective or psychomotor domains.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>More simply put, however, learning shows up as new, better or more knowledge, skills and attitudes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Any day that one or more of these has changed makes for a learning day</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>We cannot measure learning directly but we can measure what we have learned by what we are able to do - read a book, repair a piece of machinery, design a single family dwelling, explain a concept, generate ideas, work as a team member, lead a meeting, write a letter or any other of thousands of possible definable activities.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Starting from outcomes or competencies is a standard in designing school programs. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>At any point in time, some people will perform at a higher level than others; different levels are both definable and measurable.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A person’s reading ability, for example, may be described in terms of vocabulary, speed, comprehension and assistance needed and described in the form of a rating scale.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Actual placement on a rating scale may include both hard information, gathered from tests, and judgment, much like the decision-making process of a physician.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>All of this information comes together to help parents, teachers and program planners understand a student’s current condition and to make plans for the next steps, with transcripts and report cards indicating a record to the stage of learning when he leaves school.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The above notes describe OBE generally, your principal or teacher can fill in details for your school.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As usual, I would welcome your views at<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>HYPERLINK "mailto:standards2020@gmail.com" <span>standards2020@gmail.com</span><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
<p><br></p>
