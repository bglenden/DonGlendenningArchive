<div class="reader-summary">Comprehensive exploration of education definitions and PEI Department&#x27;s role. Don clarifies distinctions between education and schooling, discusses life roles framework, and outlines how other provinces (NB, Alberta) define their education departments&#x27; broader missions beyond curriculum delivery. He argues the PEI Department must redefine itself from &quot;delivering curriculum&quot; to &quot;developing people.&quot;</div>

<p>Some Definitions</p>
<p>I am not sure just how our Department of Education defines education, but here is my usual response</p>
<p><b>Education</b>: a process of engaging in experiences that result in learning information, skills, attitudes<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>and other attributes.</p>
<p><b>Education:</b> a sector of the economy focused on providing services to people who want to learn</p>
<p><b>Educated:</b> a level of education perceived to equip people to solve most problems of everyday life.</p>
<p><b>School:</b> A facility designed, equipped and staffed to support the education process.</p>
<p><b>College: an educational institution providing higher education, specialized or vocational training</b></p>
<p><b>University: an educational institution designed for instruction and examination of students in various fields of learning</b></p>

<p>About Education</p>
<p>	C</p>
<p><b>Purpose</b></p>
<p><b>Each person has their own reason for pursuing, improving, growing their education. For most people, improving education increases their likelihood of surviving and thriving in future years.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Communities also support education in the expectation that it will improve the community as a place to live. But governments and communities may also have expectations and purposes for supporting education.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b>In my reflection, I adopted the “life roles” model used by the Oregon Department of Education. According to Oregon, we each fill six life roles: individual, family member, citizen, student, producer and consumer. Presumably education contributes to all but I have not found any evidence on the matter</b></p>
<p><b>Purposes for public education vary across the country. New Brunswick seems to includes “citizen neesa” as a benchmark. I am less sure about other provinces<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>including ours. I happen to believe in curriculum maps but I’ll leave that<span class="Apple-converted-space">        </span>for a separate letter.</b></p>
<p><b>Sincerely</b></p>

  <li class="li2"><b>The knowledge or<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>training acquired by the education process</b></li>
</ul>
<p><b>I write this in order to encourage the Department to review and clarify its purpose because the Department’s definition is not clear and, furthermore, a clear purpose is required to have a strong system.</b></p>

<p><b>About Education</b></p>
<p><b>Role of PEI Department of Education</b></p>
<p><b>The Department of Education describes its role as one of “developing and delivering curriculum”. My conversations with Islanders suggests that they expect more.</b></p>
<p><b>Broader roles include:</b></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li2"><b>NB – Helping citizens gain attributes needed to be lifelong learners</b></li>
  <li class="li2"><b>Alberta – skills needed to be successful in a rapidly changing<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>economy and society</b></li>
  <li class="li2"><b>Anon – help people navigate life and contribute to society</b></li>
</ul>
<p><b>The difference between “delivering curriculum” and developing “people” is huge.</b></p>
<p><b>Sincerely</b></p>

<p><b>I raise the issue because it may explain a reluctance assume that the role of the Department is approved,, if not established<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>by the Department.even established why</b></p>

<p><b>Focus</b></p>
<p><b>One of its annual reports, the World Bank cautioned developing countries about thinking that going to school and getting an education are one and the same; we seem to have fallen into that trap also. Put simply, ducation is a process; school is a place where the process is practiced. Using he two interchangeably is confusing.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b>As an example, the PEI Government organize its activities around branches. Yje Department of Agricultire, for example, is organized around land, crops. animals and		Health is organized around primary carmhospitals and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b>To be consistent, the Deprtment would likely organize around Mathematics, the arts, languages and science.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Instead, education<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>is organized around levels –primary, elementary, secondary and tertiary.</b></p>
