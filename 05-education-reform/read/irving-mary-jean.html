<div class="reader-summary">Don&#x27;s opening letter to Mary Jean Irving outlines his concerns about PEI&#x27;s education system, emphasizing gaps in autonomy, accountability, and alignment between taught and needed skills. He describes Education 20/20&#x27;s initial projects including school awards for engagement, engagement software testing, a reading improvement initiative, and a plan to publish educational information. The letter articulates a $25,000 short-term funding goal and explains the Community Foundation&#x27;s role in administering donations. This letter demonstrates Don&#x27;s comprehensive strategic approach and his focus on data-driven education reform.</div>

<p>Dear Ms. Irving:		</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>As you may have gathered from my letters to the Charlottetown Guardian, I am concerned about the state of education in PEI.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I say this, based on my own experience, on what Islanders tell me, and what I read and hear. Without doubt, education is important, changes are needed, and there is wide support for change both inside and outside the system, but changes fall short of what is actually required and fail to deal with a number of underlying weaknesses such as autonomy, accountability and the mismatch between skills taught and skills needed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is also my view that the required changes are not likely to happen unless the public, you and I, demand it. Traditional efforts to bring about change have not worked.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Some innovative, perhaps even bold, measures are required, but we think that a better education system is worth it. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Over the past few months, I’ve been working with a small group of Islanders who are of the same mind and are willing to devote time and energy to the change process. At this point, we have launched the following initiatives:</p>
<p><br></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li6">Ongoing consultation with education officials<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
</ul>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li6">An award to an Island school, or family of schools, that best demonstrates the principle of engagement in its every-day activities.</li>
  <li class="li6">A test of a new piece of “engagement software”.</li>
  <li class="li6">A broadly representative group beginning to address the issue of low levels of literacy, and especially the improvement of reading.</li>
  <li class="li6">Publication of information through a newsletter, occasional papers, the traditional and social media.</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Our group cannot make this happen alone; we are now looking for partners and supporters; our short term goal in support of the above initiatives is $25,000.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We are pleased to be able to say that the Community Foundation of Prince Edward Island supports this educational initiative and will administer our funds.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Contributions<b> </b>to<b> Education 20/20 Inc</b>. should be directed to the Foundation (Community Foundation of Prince Edward Island, 119 Queen Street, Charlottetown, PE<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>C1A 4B3), who will issue charitable receipts.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>While we do not have much printed matter to show, the enclosed may provide some insight into our efforts and our beliefs.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I’ll be in touch in a few days seeking an appointment to talk further about education and to seek your support.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
