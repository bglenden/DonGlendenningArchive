<p>Editor:</p>
<p>Social Capital D-7</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>A successful education system depends, to a large extent, on the nature and extent of its social capital; the same can be said for a college, university or school system. Social capital may be thought of the result of “knowing, collaborating and even socializing” with other people in a sphere of your every day life.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Social capital is an intangible resource that arises out of such things as sharing or combining classes, organizing “Ag for Life Day” at Bluefield High School last year, team teaching, collaboration between parents and teachers, including others in project planning and, of course, social events.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But social capital is not reserved for people alone, it involves organizations as well.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Community projects, job shadowing, and Handle with Care are others.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Interpersonal relationships, shared sense of identity, shared understanding, shared norms, shared values, trust, and reciprocity, networks,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>willing to help each other</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Leadership is essential</p>
<p>Individuals and organizations benefit from social netwotks</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>As I write, my mind goes back to the extent to which I benefitted from social capital building opportimities created by memtors amd cplleagues.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>From research we learn that</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
