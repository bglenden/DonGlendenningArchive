<p><b>A Quality Education System</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><span><b>INTRODUCTION</b></span></p>
<p><span><b></b></span><br></p>
<p><span><b></b></span><br></p>
<p>Education is a key factor in determining one's quality of life; in the same way, the collective education of our citizens will determine to a significant degree the future of our community and country.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Because of its importance,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>provincial governments have invested heavily in the provision of educational support services for all our citizens but especially for our youth.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The system has served us well, however, as a result of the many changes occurring around us, not the least being the ever expanding information technology, there is a growing gap between what Islanders have and what they want in the way of education - and lslanders want meaningful engagement in narrowing the gap.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>This paper is focused, not on the philosophy of education but rather the characteristics of an education system that ensures quality; it draws heavily but not exclusively on recent reports published by the OECD and UNICEF.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p><br></p>
<p><span>Quality in education refers to the fitness of education for proposed purposes; quality is important in helping </span>PEI achieve economic goals, maintaining a level of trust, protecting consumers, attracting students, attract industry, meeting increased expectations and in attracting and retaining a mobile workforce.</p>

<p><b>CHARACTERISTICS OF A QUALITY EDUCATION SYSTEM</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>1	Learners who are healthy, well-nourished and ready to participate</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>We show concern for our children’s health through providing nutritious food, plenty of rest, safe surroundings and medical attention when needed; in so doing, we are not only ensuring good health today but helping to develop good health habits for tomorrow.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The same applies to education; good physical, mental, emotional health and social wellness make a positive contribution to learning.</p>
<p><b>2	Environments that are positive, safe and respectful</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>Both teachers and students, need to feel socially, emotionally, intellectually, and physically safe. People need to feel safe to be respectful to others. If we feel unsafe, we will naturally focus on protecting ourselves; we won't be able to listen to and appreciate others.</p>
<p>respectful schools are, by definition, democratically informed learning environments where people feel safe, supported, engaged, and helpfully challenged.—respectful in the context of our social, emotional, civic, and intellectual interactions.</p>
<p>A sustainable, positive school climate fosters youth development and the learning necessary for a productive and satisfying life in a democratic society. In such a climate,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li21">People are engaged and respected.</li>
  <li class="li21">Students, families, and educators work together to develop and contribute to a shared school vision.</li>
  <li class="li21">Educators model and nurture an attitude that emphasizes the benefits and satisfaction of learning.</li>
  <li class="li21">Each person contributes to the operation of the school and the care of the physical environment (National School Climate Council, 2007).</li>
</ul>
<p><span><b>3	</b></span><b>Content that is relevant with an emphasis on the skills of citizenship.</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>With a focus on rigourous and relevant curriculum:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><span>teaching</span> materials and assessment strategies are aligned with the curriculum’s rigour and relevance<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>assignments focus on the application of concepts and skills in a real-world context<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>teachers support and encourage students to meet the high standards set for them<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>teachers keep track of and share strategies that work.</p>
<p>Ladson-Billings contends that culturally relevant pedagogy has three criteria:</p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li25">Students must experience academic success.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li25">Students must develop and/or maintain cultural competence.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li25">Students must develop a critical consciousness through which they challenge the status quo of the current social order.<sup>10</sup></li>
</ul>
<p><b>4	Outcomes linked to personal and national objectives</b></p>
<p><b>Life roles</b></p>
<p><b>Schools focus on knowledge</b></p>
<p><b>Often judgd by how many go to university</b></p>
<p>Regardless of social inequities, students must be provided with the tools to achieve academic proficiency. Furthermore, in order to participate in a democratic society, students need to develop skills in literacy and numeracy and to expand their technological, social, and political abilities. Ladson-Billings maintains that culturally relevant teaching “requires that teachers attend to students’ academic needs, not merely make them ‘feel good’” and that it is imperative to have students “choose academic excellence.”<sup>11</sup> By focusing on the importance of academic success in the world, teachers can foster a desire for intellectual achievement.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>5	A support system that is focused on learners and learning.</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Ways we can help a learner with his learning</b></p>
<p><b>How to help</b></p>
<p><b>Some combination of the following</b></p>
<p><b>Many ways to express it</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li13"><b>Information</b></li>
  <li class="li13"><b>Instruction</b></li>
  <li class="li13"><b>Feedback</b></li>
  <li class="li13"><b>Recognition</b></li>
  <li class="li13"><b>Resource materials</b></li>
  <li class="li13"><b>Encouragement</b></li>
  <li class="li13"><b>Role models</b></li>
</ul>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>6	Information and advice that is both timely and independent.</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>7	Teachers who are professional, autonomous and accountable</b></p>
<p>Sherren, a columnist and specialist in management effectiveness who was born in PEI, says that employees are “responsible for their actions, behaviours, attitudes, decisions, work and performance.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Responsibility means taking ownership and corrective actions.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Accountability, on the other hand, is described by Sherren as “the process of making, keeping and managing promises and expectations… being liable or answerable for the overall outcomes.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Although the article makes no mention of schools, from his article one can conclude that teachers are responsible for seeing that students are taught.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>On the other hand, principals, as instructional leaders, are accountable for students getting what they came to school for, the skills needed in order to gain entrance to postsecondary studies or employment. Of course, students and parents also have responsibilities for success in school.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>8	Assessment that is independent and criterion referenced</b></p>
<p>Teachers assess student performance for two reasons; the first is to determine the extent to which learned what they were taught and, secondly to provide the basis for planning what to do next.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>How well one student does in comparison to another is generally is only of educational concern if it can be used to plan the next step. Student performance is assessed tor two reasons, one iAssessment and Critical to criterion referenced assessment is an evaluation framework that includes are the analysis of what is to be learned, specification of performance levels, nature of testing, approach to evaluation, benchmarks and reporting.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Training programs developed in CRI format tend to be self-paced courses involving a variety of different media (e.g., workbooks, videotapes, small group discussions, computer-based instruction). Students learn at their own pace and take tests to determine if they have mastered a module. A course manager administers the program and helps students with problems.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>CRI is based upon the ideas of mastery learning and performance-oriented instruction. It also incorporates many of the ideas found in <span>Gagne's coditions of learning</span> (e.g., task hierarchies, objectives) and is compatible with most theories of adult learning (e.g., <span>andragogy</span>, <span>experiential learning</span>) because of its emphasis on learner initiative and self-management</p>
<p><br></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li35">Instructional objectives are derived from job performance and reflect the competencies (knowledge/skills) that need to be learned.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li35">Students study and practice only those skills not yet mastered to the level required by the objectives.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li35">Students are given opportunities to practice each objective and obtain feedback about the quality of their performance.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li35">Students should receive repeated practice in skills that are used often or are difficult to learn.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li35">Students are free to sequence their own instruction within the constraints imposed by the pre-requisites and progress is controlled by their own competence (mastery of objectives).<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>

<p>Education is a lifelong process of engaging in experiences that have a formative effect on the way we feel, think and act; this effect is usually expressed in terms of a person's attitudes, skills and knowledge. Major contributors to one's education include one's home and extended family, schools and the community at large and of course, one’s self; schools play a unique role in their emphasis in formal instruction</p>
