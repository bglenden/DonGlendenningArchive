  D Nov 23 Education
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">A concise May 4, 2023 letter offering Don&#x27;s personal definition of education. He frames education as the process by which individuals close the knowledge gap between birth and adult life competence. Education is demonstrated through what people know, can do, and how they act. He distinguishes education from schooling, noting that good education enables people to handle daily life issues. This letter sets up his recurring theme—that education and schooling are fundamentally different concepts requiring separate discussion and institutional approaches.</div>

<p>Dear Editor:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><b>About Education</b></p>
<p>Education is important; it is also complex. There are many ways to describe it; a common understanding is important. Here’s my take on the subject.</p>
<p>We don’t know very much when we are born but we must know a great deal to survive and even more to thrive; learning is the process a person goes through to close the gap.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The result of what we learn is our education; it is a culmination of changes and adjustments brought about through learning . People demonstrate the nature and level of their education by what they know, can do, and how they act.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>A good education is sometimes described as one that enables a person to deal with the issues they encounter in their daily lives.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Schooling is a different matter;<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I’ll write about schools in<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>future letter.</p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
<p>Don Glendenning</p>
