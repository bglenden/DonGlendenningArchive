  100 -3 OverhaulI
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Nearly identical editor letter variant to File 15, addressing gap between needed and provided education services. Notes educators&#x27; needs often take precedence over learners&#x27;, with focus on administrative details (credits, grades, meals, technology) rather than developing knowledge, skills, attitudes, and values. Emphasizes citizens generally support education services but object to irrelevance, poor quality, limited engagement, lack of choice, bureaucracy, and unresponsiveness. Repeats recommendations for narrowing definition (50-year change noted), functional organization, PISA recommendations adoption, qualification authorities, and learner-centered system focus.</div>

<p><b>Editor</b></p>
<p><b>Education Needs an Overhaul</b></p>
<p><b>There is a growing gap between education services needed on PEI and education services provided; the needs and interests of educators seem to take precedence over the needs of<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>learners.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The conversation is bogged down on matters of administrivia (school days, credits, grades, noon meals and technology) at the expense of helping Islanders gain knowledge skills, attitudes and values that help them to thrive in later life. In saying this, I do not, we cannot, blame the current government, the previous government or any single government that went before;<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>government does, however, have a responsibility, however, encouraging and allowing improvement to take place. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b>We are responsible for our own education; we also know that improving and increasing the nature and level of education is good for both the community and its citizens.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Citizens generally support a wide range of education services; what they object o most frequently is relevance, quality, engagement ,choice,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>bureaucracy an responsiveness</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>levels educationWhile it is true that opportunities for improvement abound throughout the system, it is the writers view that much of the needed change is blocked by an outdated structure; to initiate the improvement process. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li1"><b>Broaden our definition. </b>PEI has a very narrow view of education – much narrower than that encountered on my arrival in PEI<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>50<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>years ago; narrower in terms of both offerings and availability.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Government sees its role is to deliver programs in French and English to young people.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There is no indication that learning is a developmental process nor mention of support for adult learners or encouraging independent and part time learners.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Yhe addition of Early childhood development by the previous<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>government and “life long learning” to the name of the Department implies that they are not legitimate parts<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></li>
  <li class="li1"><b>Organize based on functions: </b>I may be out of date on this issue but I was taught that in designing an organization, form follows function.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Typical function include funding, instruction,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>education products, information an counselling, quality control. Aligning the organization with functions would, I suggest, improve both communication and efficiency.</li>
  <li class="li1"><b>Adopt PISA recommendarion</b></li>
  <li class="li1">Public educators cite PISA and other rst results in support of educational improvement; yet the system ignores the findings of the OECD, the creator of PISA, when it poinys out tht PISA results are<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>better in schools that provide schools with a significant measure of autonomy in the ir day to day operations and hold schools accountable for school results. Significant measure of autonomy and accountability shifted to front line staff</li>
  <li class="li1"><b>I have never been a great believer in school document as a measure of what has been learned;<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I prefer transcripts.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Most western countries, other than Canada and the USA. I am told, have developed qualification authorities to help translation of the myriad of school credit systems.</b></li>
  <li class="li1"><b>A system focused on learners and learning rather than institutions and programs.</b></li>
