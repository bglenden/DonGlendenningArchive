  Assessment results
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Pleased by PEI&#x27;s improved Pan-Canadian test rankings, Don analyzes three assessment purposes: (1) design learning strategies (professional information shared only with client/teacher, not graded); (2) establish achievement levels (what developed countries increasingly use, replacing credentials with qualifications); (3) compare individuals (for program improvement planning). Islanders most often discuss achievement levels. Don observes confusion between achievement and grade levels, with grade levels disappearing. He proposes two system changes: (1) replace outcomes with competencies as instructional basis; (2) convert credentials to qualifications. The letter emphasizes alignment with education literature and his experience, positioning assessment reform as integral to larger system transformation. Signed as &quot;a long-time student of education.&quot;</div>
