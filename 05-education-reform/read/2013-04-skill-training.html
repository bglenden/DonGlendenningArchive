  2013-04 Skill Training
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">A detailed exploration of what skill training actually means versus superficial program reconfigurations. Don distinguishes between credentials (what was studied) and qualifications (what can be done), arguing skill training requires workplace-aligned assessment criteria rather than traditional exams. He emphasizes the importance of work habits, teamwork, and safety practices alongside technical skills, advocating for external qualification authorities rather than having schools award credentials for employment preparation.</div>

<p>Dear Sir:</p>
<p><b>Skill Training</b></p>
<p>The announcement of federal funds in support of skill training is welcome news since, without federal funds, skill training would be minimal in most Provinces.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But what does skill training mean?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Here are some thoughts on the matter.</p>
<p>Skill training is not just a matter of reconfiguring some programs, dropping a few courses and adding replacements.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Skill training is an approach to training designed to provide people with attitudes, skills, and knowledge needed to function successfully in the workplace, and includes the supporting mathematics, science and communications skills.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It starts with an analysis of the occupation, identification of the competencies that can be taught in a school setting, and the levels needed to obtain and hold a job; this becomes the basis for what is taught and how.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The length of a program will depend to a large degree, on each student’s previous training and experience.</p>
<p>Skill training requires a different approach to grading or rating performance, and a different rating scale.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Performance, while in training, should be rated against the same criteria as those used in the field.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Grades determined by exams, or even grades that mix or average written and practical work are not good enough. <span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>They should be replaced by criteria from the work place such as quality of work, ability to finish assigned tasks within a standard time frame, and to meet accepted safety practices.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>These can, and should be confirmed through demonstration, not just written tests.</p>
<p>In addition to technical skills, skilled workers should be able to demonstrate good work habits, the ability to plan ahead, to work as a member of a team, take responsibility for their own work, etc.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The culture of a skill training program is quite different from that of the typical classroom.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Educational institutions award credentials whereas employment requires qualifications; a credential tells what a person has studied; a qualification what a person can do; not all educational institutions can manage both.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>For skills training, an external qualification authority may be a better option.</p>
<p>And, as usual, I’d welcome your feedback at<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>HYPERLINK "mailto:standards2020@gmail.com" <span>standards2020@gmail.com</span><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
