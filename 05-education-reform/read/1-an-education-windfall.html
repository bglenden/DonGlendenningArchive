  1 An Education Windfall
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Contemplating hypothetical million-dollar educational investment, Don contrasts conventional spending approaches (more teachers, computers, aides, professional development days) with systemic reforms he believes would create lasting quality improvements. His priority list includes rewriting school legislation and labor agreements to empower teachers, establishing external innovation funds, increasing school operational freedom, creating independent qualification authorities, enabling credit-by-challenge, establishing separate skill training centers, expanding best-practice information sharing, developing educational navigators, enhancing public engagement, and implementing outcomes-based teacher certification. The letter consolidates his core reform vision.</div>

<p>Dear Editor:</p>
<p><b>An Education Windfall</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>I rarely buy lottery tickets; the likelihood of my winning is miniscule. But I sometimes wonder how I would spend a million dollar, or even a ten million dollar, windfall to improve the quality of education.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My interest is not just to serve existing or more students, but how to improve the long term quality of education for every Canadian.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>My options are many. The usual response would be to increase the number of teachers, buy more computers, increase the number of teacher aides, increase teacher salaries, require another year of training for all teachers, double the number of PD days, more specialists in Board offices, an extra hour a day of instruction, add a course in consumer economics, increase or decrease the number of school boards, do another study, and the list goes on, and on. None on this list would meet my criteria for improving the quality of education for every Canadian.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>On the other hand, I'd support rewriting the schools act and the current collective agreement to give teachers greater freedom and accountability (and even higher salaries), an externally controlled innovation fund, greater operational freedom for schools, the establishment of a separate qualification authority, allowing learners to challenge for credit, separate skill training centres, more public information about best practices, community based educational navigators, increased public engagement, outcomes based teacher certification, and my list goes on and on as well. My options, I believe, would have a greater chance of improving the quality of education than would the first set.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>You have my list; tell me yours. Even better, perhaps we could meet and talk; together we can make a difference. Contact me at standards2020@gmail.com,</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
