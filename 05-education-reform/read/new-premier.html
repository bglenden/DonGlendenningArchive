  New premier
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Don addresses the incoming premier with constructive proposals for education reform. He encourages updating PEI&#x27;s Philosophy of Education document, arguing the current version addresses only K-12 schooling and ignores lifelong learning, early childhood education, upgrading programs, and self-directed learning. He recommends striking a committee with public members to develop a comprehensive, forward-looking philosophy and revision of government&#x27;s role in education. Don positions education transformation as &quot;Job 1&quot; for the new government, noting that clear educational vision would significantly improve outcomes.</div>

<p>Guardian</p>
<p><b>New Premier</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>First I want to thank all the people who accepted a nomination for the coming election.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We may or may not agree on positions, policies or actions but our communities are richer because you care.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>But this letter is directed to the new Premier and I write it because you have a rare opportunity to make a difference to our community and especially to future generations of young Islanders</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I am grateful to<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>the many Islanders who put their names forward in the coming electionFirst, I want to thank you for your willingness to serve</p>
<p>Organizational changed of this kind can only be made by government; it is my hope that , when the election dust settles, our new Premier will do two things:</p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li1">Strike a committee, that includes public members, to layout the mission, mandate, principles and goals of education for Prince Edward Island (The current philosophy deals only with the public school system</li>
  <li class="li1">Take a fresh look at the role of government in ensuring that Islanders receive the quality of education that they deserve within the resources available.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Every Islander who is interested in education should read the “Philosophy of Education” found on the website of the Department of Education and Early Childhood Development. It’s a short document about purposes, basic principles, goals and the role of schools in society.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It’s a basic document and one that reflects the beliefs and values and of the people who operate our schools – but it’s incomplete. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>A philosophy of education should encompass the lifelong nature of education and take into account the needs of all Islanders; not just those in schoolsthe one referred to above deals only with young people and only that part of education provided in a school setting.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Little or no mention of services needed by preschool children, by people who ned up grading or updating through their working years, or people who may need validation for self study or learning in bits and pieces throughout life</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I’ve reviewed the It’s a useful document but it needs to be updated, refreshed, broadened and forward looking.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>WI say this because:</p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li1">It purports to be about education but is only about schooling.</li>
  <li class="li1">It is a fuzzy document</li>
  <li class="li1">Most goals are not measurable</li>
  <li class="li1"></li>
  <li class="li1">GoalsBecause hy do I say this:beliMany of our important learning experiences occur outside school our Institutions (schools, colleges and universities); in fact, increasingly one hears of employers givimg increased weight to non-school experience in theirmhirinh prsctices.frequently encounter articles th there are education needs that can be met through on line courses, self study, workplace training, in the home and elsewhere needs, needs that can be met through on line courseare an Important co but, by themselves, are not the education system.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>mponnent of an education systemA school system is one component of a</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p>I am not suggesting a million dollar study such as the recent one in done in Nova Scotia; on the other hand it updating should<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>be more than a simple rewrite of the existing philosophy with a new pen.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The development of a philosophy of all education should be “Job 1” for the new Premier.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A clear unambiguous statement of beliefs by itself would make a significant contribution to improving our education.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
<p><br></p>
