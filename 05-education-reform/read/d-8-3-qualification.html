	Labour
	mobility is a fact of life; our ancestors practiced it, so have most
	of us.  The difference is that circumstances around us have changed,
	employment numbers have increased, the pace has quickened and people
	travel further afield.  Labour
	mobility
	is an important contributor to our economy and refers to the
	movement of people from job to job, occupation to occupation and
	from one geographical location to another. While many provinces
	experience high migrant and immigrant labour mobility, Prince Edward
	Island’s mobility pattern of interprovincial migrants from within
	Canada is one of the lowest. Examples include the regular commute of
	Islanders between their home in PEI and their workplace in Alberta,
	retraining needed when a town is devastated by a plant closing, and
	a third example of mobility is the education that allows young
	people to live and work around the world. Labour mobility may be
	hampered by geographic ties, absence of housing, unemployment
	benefits, licensing requirements, lack of portable qualifications,
	and lack of recognized educational levels; the latter, educational
	levels, is the subject of this paper.</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Part
	of the mobility problem is the confusion between credentials and
	qualifications. Educational institutions award credentials (diplomas
	and degrees) to people who have successfully completed a prescribed
	number and pattern of courses. Institutions at all levels are
	conscious of mobility patterns of students and go to considerable
	lengths to ensure courses and programs are described carefully in
	terms of outcomes, objectives, time, facilities and qualified staff,
	and, in fact, will accept credentials (or credits) from other
	institutions as though they were their own. On the other hand, a
	qualification attests to the fact that the holder has demonstrated
	the attitudes, skills and knowledge required to successfully perform
	in a role or at a task in a work setting.  Hence we argue that there
	is a significant difference between the two where the credential
	<b>implies</b>
	that the holder knows something, in comparison, the qualification is
	a <b>measure</b>
	of what the holder can do with what he or she knows.  In actual
	fact, many people with credentials may be as well qualified or even
	better qualified than those without but do not have the papers to
	prove it.

	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><span lang="en-US">Given
	the absence of a Canadian qualification authority, training
	institutions issue transcripts and credentials of their own making.
	Attempts to rationalize credentials have focused on input measures
	rather than output, longer days, more subjects, additional
	technology, and more training (e.g., teachers and school
	administrators). One exception is </span>apprenticeship
	(a provincial responsibility) where provinces have found a way to
	both honour the jurisdictional boundaries and produce a
	qualification document recognized across the country.  This has been
	accomplished through common analyses, both provincial and national
	examinations and an endorsement known as the Red Seal.  Other
	exceptions include the work of the Royal Canadian Conservatory of
	Music.<span lang="en-US">

	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Canada
	needs a qualification framework and an independent body to run it. 
	Such an authority would assess and certify a person’s level of
	performance on a task or set of tasks such as found in an occupation
	or field of study. For example, a qualifications authority would
	reduce, if not eliminate, the confusion between (a) teaching where
	teachers employ formative assessment practices to promote student
	learning and (b) sorting students through summative assessment
	practices. The qualifications authority would focus certification
	more clearly on performance that matters support lifelong learning,
	and self-directed study and thereby allow schools to focus on
	formative assessment practices that serve to help students learn. A
	qualification authority would, in effect, serve two clients,
	organizations (i.e., employers) desiring an assessment of
	prospective employees and individuals wanting to confirm the level
	and suitability of their qualifications. While qualification
	authorities we are familiar with, focus on approving courses,
	accrediting institutions, and analyzing current offerings; we
	believe in a qualification authority that assesses individuals
	directly, not one that massages the minutiae of hours, outcomes,
	teacher qualification of education providers. A qualification
	authority could also play a useful role in helping people identify
	gaps in their preparation for a given field of work.

	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">We
	support a qualification authority that is independent with its own
	governing structure, accepts clients on direct application or by
	referral and issues certificates as appropriate based on
	demonstrated performance. Additionally, the authority could (on
	request) provide applicants with information on learning gaps in
	certification requirements. A qualification authority would not,
	however, organize competitions, rank students, or grant credentials.

	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><span lang="en-US">A
	review of the literature certainly supports the value of a
	qualification framework. Benefits of the qualification framework
	used in other countries include: easing the assessment burden on
	teachers and the school system, improving the consistency in
	reporting achievement, comparing foreign credentials, easing the
	mobility process, improving communications between and among
	education stakeholders, encouraging self- study and reducing the
	incidence of grade inflation. Governments in most countries have
	taken the leadership in developing a qualification framework. In the
	US, this impetus appears to be coming primarily from the private
	sector.  Given that education in Canada is a Provincial
	responsibility, it is unlikely that the Government of Canada will
	move to fill the void.  The response is in the hands of the
	Provinces or the private sector. We are appealing to the government
	of Prince Edward Island to be a leader in this area and support the
	implementation of a qualifications authority It is imperative to
	initiate the necessary steps soon; otherwise, US agencies are likely
	to fill this niche in Canada by default.</span></p>
