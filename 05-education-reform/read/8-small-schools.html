  8 small schools
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Reframing the small schools debate, Glendenning argues the question should not be whether to close small schools but whether they can deliver quality education cost-effectively. He suggests better questions are &quot;Can we design cost-effective models through small schools?&quot; and &quot;What system changes would make small schools work?&quot; He contends that current system inflexibility may be responsible for small school difficulties rather than size itself, and that educational rather than administrative-convenience decisions should guide closure determinations. This represents his consistent strategy of reframing debates toward system redesign.</div>

<p>Dear Editor:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Small Schools</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>l'm glad to see that the "small schools" issue is still alive. I believe in small schools, however, it</p>
<p>is unlikely that they can be sustained given the way the system is now organized. The fault may</p>
<p>lie with the system rather than with the small school. New thinking could result in different</p>
<p>conclusions. "should small schools be closed?" is not the right question - at least not yet.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Let's rephrase the question to ask "Can we design a cost effective model that will deliver a</p>
<p>quality education through small schools? Or perhaps an ever better question is "What changes</p>
<p>in the system are required to make small schools work?" The outcome of the discussion may be</p>
<p>the same but the decision would be an "educational" one rather than one based on</p>
<p>administrativd convenience and costs.</p>
<p><br></p>

<p><br></p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
