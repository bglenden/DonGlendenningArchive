  1-year end 2
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Year-end editor letter predicting minimal education improvement with current muddling-through philosophy but noting increasing public frustration and government openness to consultation. Recommends foundational actions: clear directional statement with glossary, principles, and service list; alternative delivery models for each service (government, commission, NGOs); government-funded services specification. Uses Department of Education website mission statement as &quot;barometer of change&quot;—current language emphasizes delivery but should emphasize encouragement, support, and regulation; addresses teacher autonomy and accountability themes.</div>

<p><b>Year end<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>ahead. New year</b></p>
<p><b>I don’t look for much improvement in<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>education during the coming year. Government seems satisfied to muddle through with existing philosophy, unclear or unstated principles, narrow focus on needs and services and devoting itself to running schools.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The good news is that (1) the public is becoming increasingly frustrated (and ready to support change) and (2) the current government seems open to both consultation and change.</b></p>
<p><b>I believe the following actions are foundational to better education:</b></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li1"><b>A clear statement<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>of direction: (Glossary of terms, Underlying beliefs and/or principles and ervices to bee offered</b></li>
  <li class="li1"><b>Alternative Best way to deliver each service (Government, commission, education or school boards, through NGO’s,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></li>
  <li class="li1"><b>List of services to be paid for government pay for<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>(literacy, numeracy, literature, employment preparation, interpersonal relationships, ???)</b></li>
</ul>
<p><b>My barometer of likely change will be the opening statwment on the Deparment of Education website; I now reads that the :role o the department of Educaion is to deliver quality prrams;<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>chanfe in the weather pattern will come with descriving the role as one of encouraging, supporting and regulsting education</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>ROLE:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b>Government has an importn role to play in education and that is<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>to provide encouragement, support and regulation, Wants to do it all</b></p>
<p><b>POLITICIZATION</b></p>
<p><b>education has adopted may of government habits to the detriment of eduction. It seems to the writer that ducation is unique in the degree thatemployees are on a government payroll. While health is not without its problems, governments seem to have a found a way to allow professional to practice ther profession; not so in education</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Complacency may stem from inability or unwillingness to understand an differentiate between education , which can and does happen anywhere, and formal “instruction” which usually happens in school and under the direction of a teachers or teachers.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>While formal may describe education any way it wishes, I believe that Governmeny has an obligation to define its use in support of better communication find a definition that is widely accceptd.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></b></p>
