  Clarity D  -
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">A letter to the editor emphasizing conceptual clarity as essential for education policy and practice. Don critiques vague or overlapping terminology in education (e.g., &quot;education and lifelong learning&quot; as redundant) and argues for precise definitions to improve program design and assessment. Advocates for shared understanding between education providers and the community.</div>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 108%">Dear
Editor:</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 108%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 108%">Education
is complex; information plays a key role.  Learners have different
interests, experiences, capabilities and  needs. Those who teach, or
other-wise serve learners, must be very clear in their communication.
Conceptual clarity heightens our understanding of key words and
concepts; lack of clarity is a significant issue for public
education.  It must be addressed directly so that the concept of
education won’t become diluted and potentially ineffective. Lack of
clarity may arise from an idea itself, from the person promoting the
idea or from the person receiving the idea; Lack of clarity could
also signal conflicting ideas and levels of discomfort or
disagreement from within the education family group itself and some
say  “clarity” is also related to self-confidence.

conclusions that follow are based on my exploration of literature,
agendas and minutes, conversations, school websites, education
associations and partnerships</p>

<ul>
	<li><p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0in">The
	Department uses “Education and Lifelong Learning” in its title;
	doesn’t “education” include” lifelong learning”?</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0in">A
	philosophy paper refers to helping young people to “secure a
	place” in society; How do we design programs to prepare for “a 
	place”?; what criteria would one use to assess progress?</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0in">The
	Department refers to its goal as one of “developing and delivering
	programs” to young; Isn’t it to help people gain skills,
	knowledge and attitudes needed to thrive in future years?</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0in">Although
	IT is not a personal strength, I was unable to find an “Island”
	definition of education. Seems that definitions should be more
	prominently displayed.</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0in">A
	recent report by World Bank cautioned developing countries about
	treating “education” and going to school as though they are one
	and the same. Aren’t we doing that also?</p></li>

takes a “village” to educate a child. It is important that the
residents and the service providers speak the same language.
