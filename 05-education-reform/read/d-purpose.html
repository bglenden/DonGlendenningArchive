  D -Purpose
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Letter to editor (reference 902-892-5859, labeled 332) on &quot;Our educational purpose.&quot; Don argues PEI lacks clear educational purpose and cites vague departmental language (&quot;creating opportunities for student success,&quot; &quot;helping students secure a place in society&quot;). Proposes education should support life roles (citizen, family member, individual, student, consumer, producer). References New Brunswick&#x27;s clear goal for Grade 5 mastery of reading, writing, numeracy. Argues clear purpose is urgent and should involve community input.</div>

<div class="reader-content">
<p>Dear Editor:</p>
<p>Our educational purpose</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>It is not clear just what we are trying to accomplish through public education in PEI.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Department literature speaks of “creating opportunities for student success”, ‘helping students secure a place in society” and the role of the Department of<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“developing and delivering high quality programs and curriculum” and there may be others.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>None of the above seem to capture the role and spirit of what education is doing or needs to be done.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Neither do they provide sufficient detail on which to design programs or measure results.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Life includes a number of roles including that of a citizen, family membe r, individual, student, consumer and producer. All roles deserve support. Based on my conversations with Islanders, citizen and employment “destinations” are suggested most often as preferred contexts</p>
<p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>A clear purpose not only directs the organization. it provides a focus for instruction and assessment; Instead of simply teaching<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>a subject or a grade level, teachers would be helping students gain skills needed to function or thrive in life roles. To quote one of my Sunday School teachers of yesteryear, not only must we have “purpose firm”, we must also “dare to make it known”.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I suggest a clear purpose for education is urgently needed and now is the time to develop it and make it known.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
<p><br></p>
