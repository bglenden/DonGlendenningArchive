  D- Choice
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Don argues that choice and autonomy are critical to well-being, yet school systems offer minimal choice compared to other services (doctors, lawyers, stores). He advocates for choice of both schools and individual teachers, noting that finding teachers suited to students&#x27; needs is as important as finding appropriate medical or legal professionals.</div>

<p><br></p>
<p>Dear Editor:</p>
<p>Choice as an agent of change</p>
<p>Paradox of choice tells us attinomy and freedom of choice are critical io our well being</p>
<p>It is interesting to note that all all organizations that provide services to the public, our school system, Our family moved to Prince Edward lsland in 1969. lt was a new community to us so we had to find a</p>
<p>new place to live, new places to shop, new doctors, new plumbers and other servicemen, new baby</p>
<p>sitters, etc.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Each time we needed a service, we asked our neighbors, colleagues at work, or new found friends for</p>
<p>recommendations. The system worked and soon we settled into the community with a family doctor, a</p>
<p>lawyer, a dentist, and an appliance serviceman to name but a few.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>As for shopping, we soon learned which stores carried which line of products; once at the store, we also</p>
<p>soon found which sales clerks had the best product knowledge and which stores provided the best</p>
<p>service. Many readers will have had the same experience when they moved to P.E.l.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The exception to our decisions, of course, was that of schools and teachers. Our decision as to home</p>
<p>location was made, at least in part, on the basis of the school which our children would attend. Once a</p>
<p>school was chosen, we had no choice of individual teachers. (And P.E.l. is no different from other</p>
<p>provinces in this respect.)</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I realize that there has been a change in this regard and today parents do have choices as to the school</p>
<p>which their children will attend. This is a good start and should be viewed as a normal operating</p>
<p>practice.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>It should also be possible to select teachers. On moving to a new community, it should be possible to ask</p>
<p>around and to identify teachers for our children. lt is not so much a good or poor teachers, or doctors</p>
<p>for Thai matter, as it is of finding ones that suit your needs or the needs of your children at that time.</p>
<p>Should-l decide on a teacher who is three miles away rather than next door, the required transportation</p>
<p>is my problem.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>And it should be possible to change teachers; we should be able to do it as easily as we can change any</p>
<p>other service provider. Students and their parents are consumers of the services which schools supply.</p>
<p>When the consumer wants to change, for whatever reason, it should be possible to do so; not only</p>
<p>possible, but relatively easy. I understand the limits to choice of any service in a small community but</p>
<p>choice of teachers is a concept foreign to the public school system. lt should not and need not be so.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>We have had the same family doctor, lawyer and other service providers for the last two or three</p>
<p>decades. We know them and they know us. lt helps to ensure that the service we need is the service we</p>
<p>get. The school system does not allow" the same relationship between students and teachers; and our</p>
<p>students suffer as a result.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>A change of teachers may make a positive impact on a student's learning; it should be possible for any</p>
<p>number of reasons; it shouldn't be a big deal. But we have made it that. But it is the student, not the</p>
<p>school, who should decide that a change would be beneficial for the learner.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>To allow choice to occur, a changed staffing pattern will likely be required. Each learner will likely</p>
<p>need a teacher/adviser who fills that role for a number of years - perhaps even for the entire L2 years of</p>
<p>public education. An adviser will work with a child, and likely all children of a family. Sometimes the</p>
<p>adviser will be able to provide the required instruction; in other cases, the child will be referred to</p>
<p>another teacher for help. This is not unlike the present medical model.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>lnjecting choice into the system would, I believe, have a salutary effect on all stakeholders. Parents and</p>
<p>students would feel that they have a major say in decisions about the education of their child. Choice</p>
<p>would, I believe, also improve accountability and recognize excellence in teaching. And more</p>
<p>responsibility for the education of individual children would be placed with the family where it belongs.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Many readers will react by saying that this cannot be done, that the scheduling and transportation</p>
<p>problems would be horrendous. I am convinced that considerable choice is possible. The first question</p>
<p>we must ask is: do we want it?</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>E{n-ulr --&lt;.</p>
