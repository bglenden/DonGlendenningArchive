<p>Dear Mr. Birt:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>This note comes to thank you for your support in our efforts to bring about change in our public education system.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>First, however, let me emphasize again the importance of education both for individuals and for the future of our community and country.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Doing more of the same is not an answer; we need a fundamental change in thinking about what constitutes an education and the role of schools.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We know at least some of the steps that must be taken, more autonomy for schools, less bureaucracy, greater freedom and accountability for teachers, more attention to the preschool years, greater choice among providers and changes in standards and reporting. <span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Since we last spoke, we have held a dozen or more meetings with small groups on a variety of educational topics with educators and the public to explore mutual concerns and interests. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As a result, we now have a cadre of people who share our philosophy, who understand the need for change and are willing to help make change happen.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We are also federally incorporated as <span>Education 20/20 Inc</span>., are working on a logo and website, and are now seeking charitable status with Revenue Canada.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In addition, we<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li5">Organized a workshop in Early Childhood Development during which a panel of front line practitioners, shared information and their experiences about approaches that work for young children; participants included other early childhood workers, parents, educators and members of the community at large.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We plans include workshops in other Island communities.</li>
  <li class="li5">Are preparing to test of a new software package, developed in Canada, to assess the range and nature of school- community engagement..<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This test is being undertaken because there is a direct relationship exists between student achievement and community engagement. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li5">Are launching<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>an award to an Island school that best exemplifies a high level of engagement in its every day school activities; criteria, policies and procedures are now being drafted.</li>
  <li class="li5">Commenced dialogue with educators, especially decision makers, about educational issues, with reading skills of high school graduates being at the top of our list.</li>
  <li class="li5">Intend to gather, produce and publish information of interest to the public at large.</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p>You were our initial supporter and we thank you for both your encouragement of our efforts and your financial support – and we’ll keep you posted on our progress.</p>
<p><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span></p>
<p>Enjoy a great family Christmas and warmest wishes for the New Year.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
