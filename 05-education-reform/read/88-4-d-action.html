  88-4-D Action
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Article No. 88 (June 4, 2020) titled &quot;Signs of Change in Education&quot; identifies indicators that suggest education reform is occurring, including media commentary beyond official channels, changed enrollment patterns at Holland College, expanded adult education offerings (particularly in Souris), and increased community participation on curriculum committees. Don notes these signals appear in people&#x27;s everyday conversations and coffee-club discussions, suggesting grassroots support for change. He maintains his core message that the education system needs overhaul due to narrow focus, bureaucracy, and lack of accountability, while emphasizing that PEI citizens desire students to be independent learners capable of working and playing together.</div>

<p><b>Signs of change in education</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>Education services on PEI need an overhaul; they are narrowly focused, cognitively based, bureaucratic, lack accountability, and focus on program delivery rather than on learner development – they also lack a self-correcting mechanism. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I do not, we cannot, blame the current government, the previous government or any single government that went before for the current status; Government has a responsibility however, for instituting corrective measures.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>People who know of my interest in education, and in my letter writing, sometime ask about signals of change; in random order, any of the following:</p>
<p><br></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li8">Comments about education in the media by spokes persons other than the Minister and Deputy.</li>
  <li class="li8">A drop in numbers or a rise in the age of enrollees in adult upgrading courses at Holland College.</li>
  <li class="li8">Announcement of increase in adult and continuing education numbers in Souris (or other centre)</li>
  <li class="li8">Statements on schools wesits aout education not just shools</li>
  <li class="li8">Addition of community members including employers are being added to curriculum committees.</li>
  <li class="li8">A positive support by a coffee club member of upcoming changes in education</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Islanders want our students to be literate and numerate, to become independent learners, to take care of themselves and learn how to work and play together. Education’s business is to help Islanders gain new and better skills, knowledge, attitudes and values.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We hear about competency based learning, self- paced programs, self-assessment and schools operating on democratic principles and wonder why these things are not being tried on PEI.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>PEI has some 150,000 citizens; all are potential users of educational services. Their need’ s, interests and capabilities are many and varied, but policy documents are focused on providing services to young people through schools. It’s as though the only education that counts is the part provided o young people in schools.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As the Word Bank suggest, going to school and getting an<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>education are not the same thing.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Neither are seat time and level achieved.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Education is important; the nature and level of education will determine in large measure, both the future of individuals and the future of the community itself. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>My own exploration reveals a number of structural problems<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p><br></p>
<p>te future of individuals and tI’m of the view that education is importantEducation, it appears, has sold it’s soul to the commercial market, It’s engaged in the development and delivery of education products = grades courses, diplomas, professional designations, and degrees,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>

<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The current conversation, however,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>is politically filtered and often bogged down on matters of administrivia (school upgrading, credits, grades, noon meals, technology, etc.) at the expense of changes that help Islanders gain knowledge, skills, attitudes and values needed to help them to thrive in later life.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>It is the writer’s view that much of the needed change is blocked (perhaps not encouraged is more accurate) by an outdated system<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>embedded in a body that can give it neither<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The direction, freedom nor support needed to accomplish the task at hand.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Government not only needs to change a number of existing policies and practices but also needs to allow, nay encourage,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>change to happen.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The World Bank recently chided Ministries of Education for not upgrading their own operation and<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>for with holding autonomy from schools.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Education needs a plan, something simple, some definitions, some guiding principles, description of services to be offered, services covered by government, and an organization that reflects the task at hand.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Such a statement should be short, sharp and developed with public input – but not by outside experts.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Education is a recognized profession, it is time to allow them to enter the fray as professionals in their own right and not to be subject to a political filter..<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
