<p><span><b>Introduction:</b></span></p>
<p><span><b></b></span><br></p>
<p>Youth today are facing many issues, including high debt load, low incomes, temporary employment, emotional stress, lack of jobs and high unemployment; the good news is that there is growing recognition that something needs to be done, and soon.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>On the one hand, a sluggish economy reduces opportunity for employment; on the other hand, young people lack skills and experience needed to take advantage of the opportunities that do come along.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As a result, our young people are at risk of an uncertain future. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span>In order to better understand the issues of youth, in late 2013, The Community Foundation of Prince Edward Island (CFPEI) undertook a survey of over 200 Island youth on a number of issues that directly affect them; the report, T</span><span>aking the Pulse of Island Youth</span><span>, available on the Foundation’s website at www.cfpei.ca, provides a snapshot of the findings.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span></span>Bright spots include a positive sense of community, emerging entrepreneurial spirit, volunteerism and new postsecondary offerings. The main concerns include a lack of jobs, surviving on low-paying jobs, educational deficiencies and drug and alcohol addictions.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>On the subject of education and learning, the study reports a high rate of completion of high school and postsecondary education, a high level of inclusivity and relatively affordable tuition costs; young people also<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>concerns about their readiness for the next stage of life including:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p><span><b>Workshops</b></span></p>
<p><span><b></b></span><br></p>
<p>To increase public awareness and understanding of the issues identified in the Foundation report, Education 20/20 organized four public discussions (Stratford, Montague, Summerside and Wellington) for the purpose of informing the community of the report and its findings, learning more about youth issues in our communities, exploring issues of education and learning, and to identify actions to be taken to close gaps.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Each session began with a presentation by Steve McQuaid, Vice President of the Community Foundation of Prince Edward Island and Katherine MacDonald, Researcher, during which they reviewed both survey methodology and findings.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The second half of the evening was given over to round-table discussion led by experienced facilitators. To launch the discussion, each participant was invited to make an opening statement; this was followed by open discussion. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Discussions ranged were lively and wide ranging, and carried on well after the formal session ended. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>For purposes of reporting, findings have been organized around questions posed.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span><b>Findings/conclusions:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></span></p>

<p><span><b>As a result of the initiative, Education 20/20 recommends that:</b></span></p>
<p>	</p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li16">Further study be undertaken to clarify the gaps in preparation for further study and for work.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li16">Schools clearly define and publicize the minimum levels required to qualify for a high school graduation diploma, especially those of communications and mathematics.</li>
  <li class="li16">Schools strengthen their role in preparing students for the labour market.</li>
