  2 Purpose
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Don expresses concern that PEI&#x27;s public education purpose is unclear. Department statements like &quot;creating opportunities for student success&quot; and &quot;developing and delivering programs&quot; lack specificity. He argues that education serves life roles (citizen, family member, consumer, producer, student) and that Islanders most often prefer citizen and employment contexts. Don advocates that clear purpose directs organization and provides focus for instruction and assessment. Referencing his Sunday School teacher&#x27;s phrase &quot;purpose firm,&quot; he urges immediate, public articulation of education purpose post-COVID.</div>

<p>Dear Editor:</p>
<p>Our education purpose</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>It is not clear just what we are trying to accomplish through public education in PEI.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Department literature speaks of “creating opportunities for student success”, ‘helping students secure a place in society” and the role of the Department as one of “developing and delivering high quality programs and curriculum” and there may be others.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>None of the above seem to capture the role and spirit of what education is doing or needs to be done.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Neither do they provide sufficient detail on which to design programs or measure results.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Life includes a number of roles including that of a citizen, family member, individual, student, consumer and producer. All roles deserve support. Based on my conversations with Islanders, however, citizen and employment “destinations” are suggested most often as preferred contexts. New Brunswick reviewed and revised their education system 3-4 years ago; their release includes a statement to the effect that “every child will leave Grade 5 having mastered the tools to learn – reading, writing and numeracy.’</p>
<p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>A clear purpose not only directs the organization. it provides a focus for instruction and assessment; Instead of simply teaching<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>a subject or a grade level, teachers would be helping students gain skills needed to function or thrive in the years ahead. To quote one of my Sunday School teachers of yesteryear, not only must we have “purpose firm”, we must also “dare to make it known”.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Covid years were difficult for education; a “post Covid” public conversation about the future of education is called for.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
<p><br></p>
