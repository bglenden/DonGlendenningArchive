  D 2014 Class size
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">A more developed response to the Minister&#x27;s statement on class size, Don acknowledges the Minister&#x27;s correct point that class size alone doesn&#x27;t improve achievement while building on it. He references diverse staffing models from Arizona (teacher assistants), Michigan (principal-reduced management), Saskatchewan (differentiated staffing), and national research on teacher mobility. The letter advocates for exploring alternative staffing strategies while commending the Department&#x27;s upward PCAP trend, balancing criticism with recognition.</div>

<p>Dear Sir:</p>
<p><b>Class size</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I read the Minister’s Guest Opinion about class size (Guardian October 4, 2014) with considerable interest; as far as I am concerned he put the teacher student ratio issue to rest when he reported that PEI ratios are among the lowest in Canada and reducing class size by itself doesn’t improve student achievement. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>When I read the article in this morning’s paper (Guardian, October 10, 2014) about the issue of class size, the following alternatives came to mind: a high school I once visited in Arizona where educational achievement improved dramatically by increasing the number of teaching assistants not teachers, a mall school in Michigan where they dispensed with a principal and operated the school<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>more like a lawyers’ office, a Saskatchewan report on differentiated staffing, and the Rand Report on Teacher Mobility. <span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Given the Department’s efforts to increase school achievement levels, it may be time to explore other staffing strategies.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>With regard to PCAP results (Guardian, October 8, 2014), the Department should take satisfaction in the upward trend line of the PEI results.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I am not sure just how the results will be used but, according to an OECD report, the real benefits of such tests often come when results are posted.</p>
<p><span>S</span>sincerely,</p>
<p>Don Glendenning</p>
