<div class="reader-summary">Letter distinguishing between credentials (diplomas/degrees certifying program completion) and qualifications (attesting demonstrated competency). Triggered by a University of Moncton professor controversy, Glendenning argues transcripts inadequately assess citizenship/employability skills and proposes redesigned transcripts or gold seal endorsements reflecting basic skills competency needed for modern economic participation.</div>

<p>Dear Sir:</p>
<p><b>Credential or Qualification?</b><b></b></p>
<p>The recent publicity about the qualifications of a professor at the<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>University of Moncton raises issues about the usefulness of using diplomas and degrees as screening devices.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Diplomas are issued by educational institution to let people know that the holder has completed a programme of studies; degrees are granted on a similar basis.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Degrees and diplomas are considered credentials in that they may provide entrance into an arena but are not an indicator of how well the holder will perform once there.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Diplomas and degrees are too large a mesh for screening employees; too many good workers are missed. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Employers can quickly assess technical skills; neither transcripts or diplomas provide information about<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>basic skills; I call them citizenship skills, other call them employability skills, generic skills or even life skills. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Perhaps a redesigned transcript would provide the information</p>
<p>A second transcript dealing with skills needed in every occupation but also in life generally</p>
<p>Perhaps even an endorsement, a gold seal, to identify not only that a person has graduated but as reached a level in basic skills to allow him or her to participate in the modern economy.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As a first step, a conversation with your local high school principal<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It seema s as though both employers and teachers want to , place to start is with a dialogue</p>
<p>Readers who view the “folded paper” in a different way will, I am sure, enlighten me at<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>HYPERLINK "mailto:standards2020@gmail.com" <span>standards2020@gmail.com</span><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Sincerely</p>

<p>In the case of the professor, his field of study and recognized expertise were quite different fields.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></p>

<p>Providing information that he knew to be untrue</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>A qualification, on the other hand, describes what a person can do; the issuer of a qualification attests to the view that the holder has demonstrated the attitudes, skills and knowledge required to successfully perform in an occupation, role or task. <span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></p>
