  Innovation-1
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">A proposal to stimulate innovation in PEI&#x27;s education system through an Innovators Network that would connect educators working on innovations, provide information about educational advances, and recognize and reward creative contributions. Don argues that education systems are bureaucratic and top-directed (inhibiting innovation) and proposes encouraging innovation through awards, public recognition, promotional campaigns, and competitions. He identifies PEI&#x27;s historical tradition of innovation in agriculture, pharmaceuticals, and avionics, and proposes systematic support for educational innovators including electronic networking, newsletters, forums, and ongoing professional development rather than periodic initiatives.</div>

<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.14in">
<span lang="en-US">It is widely recognized that the level and quality
of education is key to our future as individuals, families,
communities and countries.  There is also a widely held view that the
education system we now have is unlikely to provide the education our
people need, especially our young people.  The call for change is
broad and comes from many voices, including educators, employers, and
the public at large. .</span></p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.14in">
<span lang="en-US">There is no doubt that </span>education is
important, that improvement is needed, there is wide support for
change, and necessary changes are not likely to happen unless the
public demands it. Traditional efforts to bring about change have not
worked.  Some innovative, perhaps even bold, measures are required,
but a better education system is worth it and <b>Education First </b>
 would like to play a leading role, perhaps even a bold one, in
making change 
</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.14in">
Education systems are top directed and bureaucratic; such a climate
is not supportive to front line innovation. In addition, educational
innovators often work alone in schools that are miles apart.  If we
want to encourage innovation, this needs to change change the climate
and offer more support.

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in"><b>Innovation</b></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.14in"><span lang="en-US">A
quick scan of our early history reveals that Islanders have always
been, and still are,  innovators.  New agricultural and seafood
products, pharmaceuticals and avionics are but a few of the newer
fields of endeavour.  All sectors and businesses continue to reinvent
themselves regularly, and must continue to do so, every sector, it
seems axcept education.  Every sector can benefit from innovation,
Innovative ideas can come from many sources and innovation can be
encouraged through offering incentives and awards.  Educational
improvement can benefit from similar measures. </span>

<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.14in"><span lang="en-US">Neither
change nor innovation is a switch to be turned on and off and on as
needed. Receptivity to change must be cultivated, it must become part
of our culture – and we certainly aren’t there yet.  Conservatism
is entrenched, the system reminds one of the military or early
industrial organizations.  The authentic innovation is probably
happening in spite of the system rather than because of it.</span></p>

Schacter, writing in the globe and Mail on May 6, 2012 identified the
<strong><span style="font-weight: normal">Five key elements</span></strong>
key to successful change in any business:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Talent, because
	the skills needed for core and adjacent innovations are different
	from transformational efforts; 
	</p></li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Offering that
	talent a chance to work separately from the core business so they
	can escape the gravitational pull of the corporate past; 
	</p></li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Sustained, and
	often significant, funding; 
	</p></li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Strong
	oversight of the innovation pipeline, so that sufficient innovation
	is in the works to handle future needs; and 
	</p></li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Measurements to
