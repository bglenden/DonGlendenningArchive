  1 About educations
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Don presents foundational concepts: learning closes the gap between birth knowledge and survival/thriving knowledge; teaching helps learners through information, counselling, instruction, funding, technology, and quality assurance. He defines education as the culmination of learning changes and good education as enabling people to handle daily life issues. Emphasizing the World Bank&#x27;s distinction between going to school and getting education, Don critiques using schooling as &quot;public shorthand&quot; for education, likening it to people calling all snowmobiles &quot;Skidoos.&quot; He calls for careful language from education leaders and differentiating between education and schooling.</div>

<p>Dear Editor:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><b>About Education</b></p>
<p>Education is important; it is also complex. There are many ways to describe it; a common understanding is important. Here’s my take on the subject.</p>
<p>We don’t know very much when we are born but we must know a great deal to survive and even more to thrive; learning is the process a person goes through to close that gap. Teaching refers to helping others with the learning process.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Help with learning usually comes in the form of information, counselling, instruction, funding, resource people, products and technology and quality assurance.</p>
<p>The result of what you have learned is your education; it is a culmination of changes brought about through learning - changes in what you know, what you can do, attitudes, values and more. People demonstrates the nature and level of their education by what they know, can do, and how they act. A good education is sometimes described as one that enables a person to deal with the issues they encounter in their daily lives. Years of study is frequently used as a proxi.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Over the years, schools and schooling have become a ”public shorthand” for education. The World Bank tells us that “going to school” and getting an education are not the same. I think using the words interchangeably is misleading, a main cause of miscommunication and downplays the importance of our efforts..<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>It behooves us all to choose our words carefully.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
