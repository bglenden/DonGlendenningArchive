  7 Who needs to know
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Glendenning questions testing&#x27;s purposes and appropriate audience. Testing serves diagnostic (establishing performance levels) and sorting (ranking learners) functions. He argues that learners, teachers, and parents need diagnostic information for instructional improvement, while planners need aggregate data about learner populations needing different support levels. However, he questions whether schools should sort learners, arguing that unlike races where ranking matters, educational success is potentially universal. He contends schools should test to improve instruction but not to publicize individual rankings, suggesting that sorting wastes instructional time while providing no learning benefit.</div>

<p>Dear Editor:</p>
<p>Who needs to know?</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>ln our discussion of student testing, we should remember that test-taking is an individual matter</p>
<p>although a test taker may do so in a group setting. Also, test results are very personal, just as</p>
<p>personal as the results of medical tests.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>"Why test?" Two reasons come to mind. The first is to establish a state or level of performance</p>
<p>or achievement; the second is to sort learners into categories.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Who needs to know a student's level of achievement? Obviously the learner and teacher, and</p>
<p>the parents or guardians of young learners. These people need to know because of their</p>
<p>centrality to the learning process. Beyond that, only the learner has the right to tell others or</p>
<p>authorize the giving out of information; I believe that is the practice anyway.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>People who plan and provide learning resources, the Minister and the bureaucracy, need</p>
<p>information about likely users, but not individuals, so that they can make available learning</p>
<p>resources and opportunities of the right kind and in the right mix. Planners need to know the</p>
<p>nature of learning assistance required, numbers requiring each kind of assistance, otherwise</p>
<p>they cannot plan properly.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>We also test to sort; although l'm not really sure just why schools take on this responsibility.</p>
<p>Entering a school is not the same as entering a race. All, or practically all, who enter can</p>
<p>graduate. Some may need a bit more time than others but success for all is within reach. Who</p>
<p>needs to know who came first? Or last? How does knowing one's ranking help a learner? Do</p>
<p>we should we publicize the names of people who made the fastest recovery from an illness?</p>
<p>Would providing such information speed the recovery of other patients? Or would it help a</p>
<p>patient reach a higher level of wellness? Or even help a person stay well longer?</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Testing is an important part of the teaching learning process. The purpose of our tests must be</p>
<p>clear - especially to the learner. Schools must test, or more accurately, teachers must test, in</p>
<p>order to improve instruction but l'm not convinced that schools should be in the business of</p>
<p>sorting learners. Maybe dropping the sorting function would provide extra time for instruction.</p>
<p><br></p>
