  Priorities 2
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Don proposes an alternative education budget process emphasizing school-level autonomy while maintaining governmental control. He recommends: freezing education budgets at 2015 levels, reserving funds for basic skills (math, science, communications, computer language), allowing principals curriculum decisions within allocations in consultation with their communities, and establishing an innovation fund for special projects. Don argues this approach provides government necessary control, implements OECD-recommended school autonomy, and meaningfully engages communities—all characteristics of quality education systems. This reflects his commitment to balancing fiscal responsibility with local governance.</div>

<p>Dear Sir:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Priorities for education</p>
<p>The beginning of a new year encourages one to review personal priorities and doing so led me to thinking about priorities in education.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is not a subject often discussed or, at least, not discussed publicly. To those of us on the outside, it appears that each year officials review the relevant statistics, apply the appropriate formula, add a few dollars for special initiatives and present it to the legislature for approval – and all of this will be done with little if any significant input by front line teachers and principals. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Being conscious of the size of the education budget, the desirability of freedom and accountability at the school level and the desirability of community engagement, let me propose an alternative budget process for 2016:</p>
<p>Freeze the education budget at the 2015 level.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Reserve funds at each school for basic skills of math, science, communications and a computer language.</p>
<p>Allow principals to decide other offerings within their allocation and in consultation with the community they serve.</p>
<p>Establish an innovation fund to which schools could apply for special project funding<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>This would give the government the control it needs, significantly increase school autonomy as recommended by the OECD, and make for significant community engagement – all important characteristics of a quality education system.</p>
<p>With best wishes for the New Year</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Don Glendenning</p>
<p>A long-time student of education</p>
