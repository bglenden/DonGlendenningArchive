  D-9 Youth problem  
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Don frames youth employment/continuation challenges as an educational system problem rather than individual student failure. Many young people exit the school system lacking credits, knowledge, or skills needed for further education or employment, yet he rejects blame-the-student-or-parents interpretations. Instead, he advocates society has responsibility to increase these young people&#x27;s chances of success. Based on extensive conversations with educators and stakeholders, he identifies key systemic gaps: absence of clear educational model defining what education is, who it serves, and what outcomes matter; lack of a functioning Department of Education with appropriate mandate; and absence of delivery models matching the educational philosophy. The letter demonstrates his conviction that systemic responsibility precedes individual blame.</div>

<p>Dear Sir:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><b>Youth problem</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>PEI has a problem; I call it a youth problem but most call it an education problem. Until it is resolver, many of our young people face a bleak future, and life for all of us is less than it could be.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In saying this, I refer to the many young people who find themselves out of the public school system but, apparently, lacking credits, knowledge or skills needed to continue their education or secure employment.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Some would say, and many do, that the problem is of the student’s own making, or upbringing, and they may be correct, but I believe that we owe it to them and to ourselves to increase their chances of success.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Where to start?</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>During the past couple of years, I’ve been talking to anyone who would listen and listening to anyone who would talk about education and, in relation to the youth problem, here are some of the key things I learned.</p>
<p>We lack a clear mental model of what education is, who it is for<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>and what<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>We do not have a Department of educ</p>
<p>Lack a delivery model connsisten with the model and with good management.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
