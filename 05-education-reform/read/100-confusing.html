  100 confusing
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">An October 2019 letter to the Charlottetown Guardian editor expressing concern about inconsistent use of education terminology. Don distinguishes education (formative personal experience) from schooling (institutional provision), noting this confusion undermines policy coherence. He criticizes graded structures that assume uniform learner development and urges employers/institutions to recognize the distinction between credentials and qualifications. A concise statement of semantic confusion as a root cause of systemic problems.</div>

<p><b>Dear Sir:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b>Need Public discussion needed<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b>Communication oroblem</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>I’m getting confused about education; education terms just don’t seem to have meaning they once did.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Education seems to have lost iis reputation as a stickler for detail; on the other hand, maybe I’m getting grumpy in my old age. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Let’s start with education. I define education as ”any experience that has a formative effect on the way a person thinks, feels or acts”.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>One’s education results from experiences at home, school, in church, at work and in the community at large; education is a very personal matter and only happens with individuals (although often in a group setting). A person who helps another person with learning is known as a teacher.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Because of the numbers involved, learners and teachers often come together in a purpose built facility called a school.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Whereas in the health system, patients go<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>to hospitals for help with individual needs, in education, learners go to school every day for instruction whether they need it or not.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Furthermore, whereas, the length of stay in a hospital varies the length of stay in school is the same for all.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>While completing a period of study is worthy of recognition the matter of grades is somewhat problematic.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Individuals have different capacities, different experiences, and different interests; to group them in to grades and pretend that they are at the same level and will proceed on the same learning schedule does not make sense.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>On the other hand, employers and postsecondary institutions should be wary of using graduation as entrance to further study and the world of wor. The criteria for awarding a credential<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>and those for a qualification are seldom the same.</b></p>
