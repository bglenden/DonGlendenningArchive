<p><b>Excellence in Education Award - 2015</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>EDUCATION</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>Our future as individuals and as communities depends to a large degree on the quality of our education.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Gaining a quality education, therefore, should be a major focus of every citizen, providing a quality education should be the focus of governments, and providing a quality education the objective of every teacher and school.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><span>port for the view that incentives and awards help to improve student results; an award for having done something done rather than a grant to do something. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>EXCELLENCE IN EDUCATION AWARD</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>Thanks to the generosity of an Island family, Education 20/20 Inc. has established an awards program as a mechanism to call attention by the public to important characteristics of effective schools and to provide some financial support to schools for their efforts to implement them.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The focus of the award is on engagement in the daily operation of the school and on those items over which the school has substantial control</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>including </span>communication with family, the school culture, interaction with the community, frequency of community based events and parent/community involvement in curriculum development and planning.<span> <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
