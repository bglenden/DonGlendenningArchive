<div class="reader-summary">Don proposes creating an &quot;education drugstore&quot;—a physical location where parents, grandparents, and students can browse and purchase supplementary educational materials aligned with school curricula. After visiting the Provincial Learning Materials Distribution Centre, he recognized the gap between online availability and tangible access to materials. He envisions a retail-like space where customers handle actual resources before purchasing, potentially staffed by education specialists. Don identifies this as an underserved market niche that could enhance family support for student learning.</div>

<p>Dear Sir:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><b>An educational drugstore</b></p>
<p>Recently, I visited the Provincial Learning Materials Distribution Centre; it houses support materials for the public school system.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Most orders are “school sized” so it is not a place that has many visitors; while there, I picked up a copy of the curriculum guide for Grade 10 Math.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I’ve often perused curriculum guides on the Provincial website but I find it useful to have an actual copy to look at when talking with others about the subject.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Although not in the retail business, they are able to sell directly to people: parents may find the curriculum guides useful when helping their children, especially on subjects that children find difficult.</p>
<p>That got me thinking about the availability of supplementary resource material, material used by an earlier or later grade, or something not used in the system at all.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I know materials are available on line but I wonder if there is a place where people can actually handle the material?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In asking the question, I am visualizing an “education drugstore” where parents, grandparents or students themselves browse and even purchase education products; if traffic warranted, it could even be staffed by a specialist, equivalent to a pharmacist.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I know that book stores often carry some resource material but they are not referenced to the school curriculum. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The “education products” function, except for books, is not a part of the sector that we hear much about.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Don Glendenning</p>
