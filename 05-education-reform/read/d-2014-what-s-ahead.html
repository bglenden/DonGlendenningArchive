<div class="reader-summary">A January 2014 draft letter to the Guardian reflecting on education trends and predictions for 2014 PEI. Don observes rising public concern about basic skills gaps, notes increased media coverage of education issues (citing three of six Globe and Mail opinion pieces in December), and predicts growing pressure on schools from online learning, demands for transparency, and rising teacher activism in reform movements.</div>

<p>Editor, Charlottetown Guardian</p>
<p>Charlottetown, PEI	</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Dear Sir:</p>
<p><b>Education in 2014<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>I’m not one for year end or new year resolution s or predictions and I am wondering what the hot button items in PEI will be in the coming year.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I am of the view, however, that more Canadians are making their concerns public.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I was struck, for instance in early December to find three of the six opinion pieces in the Globe and Mail were about education. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In addition a few weeks ago, a friend who has sno special interest in education remarked that education appears to pop up more often in the guardian as well.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I have certainly encountered all the usual concerns</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Islanders are making their views known but, given the vi debate on education during the waning weeks, on wonders if we may actually be witnessing a shift of thinking on how citizens are feeling about the state of public education. There certainly is considerable unease about basic skills of young people still in school or those who have just graduated.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>are still waiting for a signal that something will be d <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I doubt that there will be any significant growth in on-line- courses mostly because the system is not able to take advantage of them. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>on line courses<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>steady</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Engagement, morepparents engaged in discussion, asking questions, parent teacher sessions</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Rise of degrees and diplomas<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>via technology wil pur t increased pressure on traditional institutionsDegrees<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>and diplomas will continue to lose value</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Rise in media coverage of educ concerns, letters to eitor <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>3/6 opinion pieces, local media</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Basic skills, especially math and writing. I know that this implies reading as well fed by PISA and the large number of young adults lacking work entry levels skills</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>May see a demand for schools to help students prepare for qualifications</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Demand for more and even more indepenedent information about education and even about a childs progress.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Rising visibility of teachers in the reform movement</p>

<p><b>Invisibility of Teachers<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
