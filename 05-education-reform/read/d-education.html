  D Education
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">From November 10, 2010, Don addresses postsecondary funding and student attitudes. He proposes recognizing high school graduation as significant by awarding cash prizes alongside diplomas, regardless of further study intentions. He advocates for measuring and reporting student attitudes on report cards, believing measurement drives teaching focus. His core insight—&quot;What gets measured, gets taught&quot;—reflects his data-driven approach to educational improvement and belief in explicitly valuing non-academic outcomes.</div>

<p>Dear Sir:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Improving education</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Two items caught my attention in this morning’s paper; one dealt with<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>postsecondary tuition and the other with the role of schools in developing positive attitudes<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>of students.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>As for tuition, I’d like to see more of the financial support flow directly to students.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>For example, I view high school graduation is a significant milestone in its own right.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Why not recognize its significance, therefore, by giving each graduate a cash award, along with their diploma, whether or not they enroll in postsecondary studies? <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The same principle could apply to students in college and university. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>If we are serious about wanting schools to help students develop more acceptable attitudes, then we should include “attitudes” on the report card -and give a rating.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As a colleague often said, “What gets measured, gets taught.” <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The role of schools in teaching attitudes contentious, but that does not mean it should be ignored.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Taxpayers fund schools; if they want schools to provide more attention to attitudes, they should say so.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Until then the issue will remain an item mentioned from time to time in letters to the editor.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
<p><br></p>
