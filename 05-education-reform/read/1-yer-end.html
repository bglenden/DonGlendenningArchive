<div class="reader-summary">Year-end editorial referenced as &quot;celebrating entrance to new personal decade,&quot; offering educational system critiques. Notes government difficulties distinguishing between education (universal, ongoing) and formal instruction (school-based). Advocates government focus on planning, funding priorities, monitoring rather than direct operation. Identifies need for clear philosophical framework, though acknowledges 4-5 year government horizons conflict with education&#x27;s longer-term requirements. Addresses themes of vision, role clarity, politicization, teacher autonomy, and accountability.</div>

<p><b>Year end<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>ahead. New year</b></p>
<p><b>To celebrate my entrance to new personal decade, I decided to offer a few more unsolicited views about education.</b></p>
<p><b>Significant improvement is unlikely; Seems satisfied to muddle through following he xisting philosophy, 30 years old,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>philoso without No<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>evidence of planned improvements<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b>VISION</b></p>
<p><b>Government seems to have difficulty in understand inng the difference etween education , which can and does happen anywhere, and formal “instruction” which usually happens in school and under the direction of a teachers or teachers.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>While formal may describe education<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>ny way it wishes, I believe that Governmeny has an obligation to define its use of the word and , in support of better communication find a definition that is widely accceptd. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Education is ongoing and needs underlying principles; plans, policies and a lengthy horizon. government thrives on events and announcements normslly not to exceed 4-5 years;<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Unfortunately</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>ROLE:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b>Government has an importn role to play in education and that is<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>to provide encouragement, support and regulation, Wants to do it all</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>POLITICIZATION</b></p>
<p><b>education has adopted may of government habits to the detriment of eduction. It seems to the writer that ducation is unique in the degree thatemployees are on a government payroll. While health is not without its problems, governments seem to have a found a way to allow professional to practice ther profession; not so in education</b></p>
