  Notes based on Objectives proposed for new Non Profit Act
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">(100-200 words):**
Policy analysis notes on objectives for proposed non-profit legislation, likely PEI-focused. Document outlines six core objectives: (1) public education and policy advocacy through newsletters, websites, and papers; (2) monitoring education systems and analyzing compliance with research/best practices; (3) engaging parents and communities through workshops on essential skills, learning frameworks, and educational models; (4) supporting learner-centered activities; (5) professional development for educators; (6) organizational growth and sustainability. Detailed budget line items indicate Don&#x27;s involvement in advocacy organization planning. Workshops mentioned suggest he envisioned Education 20/20 (referenced elsewhere in batch) as platform for community education. Notes reflect Don&#x27;s philosophy of systematic public engagement, research-based advocacy, and educator professional development - core themes throughout his career.</div>
