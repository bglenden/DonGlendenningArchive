<div class="reader-summary">Letter to the Charlottetown Guardian arguing for the restoration of exam exemptions for high-achieving students, a practice that existed at Colonel Grey High School until 2012. Glendenning cites evidence that non-traditional credit arrangements (exemptions, online courses, challenge for credit) are widely available across Canada and supported by both educators and parents. He appeals for the Premier to include flexible credit options in future policy announcements as a key student incentive.</div>

<p>April 6, 2015</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Editor,</p>
<p>Charlottetown Guardian</p>
<p>Charlottetown, PEI	</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Dear Sir:</p>
<p><b>High School Exemptions</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Now that Easter is behind us, students across the country will be thinking about year end and final exams. In other Provinces students who have done well during the year, may consider exemptions or challenge for credit.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>At one time, Island students thought that way too.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If they maintained high marks and met school standards, students could be exempted from writing some exams – at least this was the case for students in Colonel Grey High School until 2012. Exemptions were considered a student motivator; why they were discontinued is not clear.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>A quick internet survey finds non-traditional credit arrangements to be widely available at the high school level across the country; in addition to exemptions, some schools allow students to take courses on line, challenge for credit and receive recognition for independent study.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Numbers exercising that option are on the increase in colleges and universities, but I was unable to find numbers for secondary schools.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Most people I talk with, and most letters to the Editor, support exemptions, Senior High Working Group in their report in 2013 recommended flexible credit options, and Education 20/20 Inc. in its presentation to the English Language School Board.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Perhaps the next round of announcements by the Premier could include the opening up of credit options; doing so would reinstate an important incentive for students.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Don Glendenning</p>
<p>A long-time student of education</p>
