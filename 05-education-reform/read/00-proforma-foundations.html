<div class="reader-summary">Fundraising letter dated February 17, 2014, to potential foundation donors outlining Education 20/20 Inc.&#x27;s three-pronged strategy: independent information (monthly newsletter, website hub), engagement (workshop series across PEI, community discussions), and recognition/incentives (education awards, innovation encouragement). Requests $22,000 support: $15,000 for information gathering, $2,000 for incentives, $2,500 for workshops, $2,500 operations. Emphasizes system inadequacies in autonomy, innovation, teacher incentives, and parental choice. Demonstrates Don&#x27;s compelling articulation of educational system deficiencies and solutions.</div>

<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in"><span lang="en-US">Over
the past few months, I’ve been working with a small group of
Islanders who believe that </span>education is important, that it
needs some changes and that the key to change is an informed and
engaged public.  We are also of the view that the school system is
unlikely to make the necessary changes by itself; so, we’ve
established an independent group, Education 20/20 Inc. (Mission
statement attached).  Our initial strategy is three pronged,
independent information, engagement and incentives, with the
objective of encouraging changes that will improve the quality of
education for all.

<ul>
	<li><p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><b>Independent
	information:</b>
	 Most of our information about education comes from the people who
	operate the school system; to address the shortage and lack of
	independence, Education 20/20 Inc. produces a monthly electronic
	newsletter; in addition, our website has just gone live and we plan
	to use it as an information hub for surveys, announcements,
	occasional papers, social media, etc.<b>
	 (</b><u><a href="http://www.education2020.ca/"><b>www.education2020.ca</b></a></u><b>)

</p>
<ul>
	<li><p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><b>Engagement</b>:
	   Having information is one thing but understanding, internalizing
	and using it is another.  As a first step, we’ve launched a series
	of workshops across PEI, the first was held on January 20 in the
	Stratford Town Hall, was well attended.  A repeat is scheduled for
	Montague on February 18 and dates have been set for others.   Our
	thinking is to encourage discussions on educational issues of all
	kinds in many Island communities.  (As one participant pointed out,
	the very fact that an independent organization convened such a
	meeting is a breakthrough)

</p>
<ul>
	<li><p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><b>Awards
	and incentives</b>:
	The education sector lack incentives – students cannot finish
	early; there is little encouragement to innovate, principals have
	little autonomy to make local adjustments; teachers are paid for
	what they know rather than what they do, each school is a cookie
	cutter of all other schools, and parents have little choice in
	choosing a school and none in choosing a teacher.  As an incentive
	to greater engagement, and thanks to a generous donor, Education
	20/20 will soon announce an educational award for a school or
	learning centre that best demonstrates engagement in its everyday
	activities; we plan to expand our incentive program into other areas
	and beyond the borders of PEI.</p></li>

<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in"><span lang="en-US">Our
pressing need is for help in putting relevant information onto our
website and into the public domain; our longer term horizon, however,
includes facilitators to support engagement processes in local
communities, an expanded incentives program, technology based micro
clips on key education concepts, </span> math clubs for students,
professional support for teachers at all levels, creativity
workshops, student competitions, promotion, and surveys,

group cannot make this happen alone; funds are needed first to
continue the initiatives mentioned above, but also to develop new
ones.  Our current needs are modest, our short term goal for support
of the above initiatives is $22,000 broken out as follows:</p>
