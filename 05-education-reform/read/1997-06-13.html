<div class="reader-summary">Letter to the Editor of Moncton Times (June 13, 1997) from Don Glendenning addressing school closings in Maritime communities. Don critiques government plans to close small schools, arguing the closure debate focuses on confrontation and money rather than learning quality. He challenges the assumption that the current educational delivery model is the only viable option, suggesting governments pursue alternative delivery models. Don proposes schools use site-based management to examine operational efficiencies, asking principals to explore cost-saving measures working with teachers and communities. He questions whether small schools using different approaches might deliver quality education cost-effectively compared to large schools, advocating for innovative solutions before accepting closures.</div>

<p>1997 06 t3</p>

<p>Editor, Moncton Times</p>
<p>Moncton, NB</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>A number of small communities in the Maritime Provinces and elsewhere are in danger of losing</p>
<p>their schools. The debate about school closings rages with considerable heat but little light.</p>
<p>Governments are committed to closing a number of small schools and are engaged in a bitter battle</p>
<p>with the communities concerned. My concern is for the education of the children who will be</p>
<p>affected by such closures.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Media reports which I have seen focus on the confrontation and power struggle. The problem</p>
<p>seems to be one of money. The premise is that we cannot continue to offer educational services to</p>
<p>small communities. The government's position also implies that the current model is the only</p>
<p>model to be followed. In support of their current delivery model, governments lengthen the school</p>
<p>day, lengthen the school year, revise curriculum, enhance the staff/student ratio, increase the</p>
<p>qualifications of teachers, close small schools, add computers, etc. Laudable as these moves are,</p>
<p>they are not likely to significantly improve the quality or lower the cost of education. A more</p>
<p>fundamental revue of both learning and delivery models is necessary.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>A more productive approach, I believe, would be to examine alternative approaches to providing</p>
<p>education to small communities. The basic question is "Is it possible to offer a quality education to</p>
<p>youngsters in small schools (or is it small and rural communities ?) and at a reasonable cost ?</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Why not ask principals of the affected schools, working with teachers and community</p>
<p>representatives, to examine current operational procedures and budgets to see if savings can be</p>
<p>effected ? Or better still, why not provide schools with their grant and let them make the decisions</p>
<p>at the local level about how the money can best be spent to effect a quality education. Site</p>
<p>(school) based management is a recognized element of innovative schools; why not give it a try in</p>
<p>some of your small schools ?</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>There is no simple solution to the problem of small schools in New Brunswick or elsewhere. But</p>
<p>before we close them, let's see if there are steps which we can take to make them both efficient</p>
<p>and effective. It may turn out that small schools, using a different approach, can provide a quality</p>
<p>education at lesser cost than can large ones.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
<p><br></p>
