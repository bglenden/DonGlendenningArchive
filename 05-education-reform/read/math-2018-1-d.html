<div class="reader-summary">Policy paper addressing mathematics education following Community Foundation of PEI&#x27;s youth survey (2013) revealing preparedness gaps in postsecondary and workplace readiness. Documents Education 20/20&#x27;s six public discussion series responding to survey findings. Frames mathematics as essential citizen-level skill for all Islanders based on Oregon Department of Education principles. Identifies instruction providers spanning public schools (comprehensive Grades 1-12 with testing and streaming), postsecondary (UPEI programs and School of Mathematics), SkillsPEI (federal funding coordination), private schools, and independent learners. Analyzes proficiency determinants: skill number, performance level, and clustering. Distinguishes formative assessment (interactive teacher-student process) from summative assessment (regulatory independent function). Notes competencies as &quot;gradeless&quot; (learnable across all levels with varying achievement). Documents related developments including MPHEC competency adoption, Queens medical program conversion, holistic rating scales, independent field analysis, ungraded schools, separate grading authorities, and streaming disappearance. States eleven system conclusions emphasizing non-school-alone solutions, fragmentation, grading non-educational role, inconsistent teacher authorization, definition barriers, coordination absence, and provider cooperation willingness.

<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">In
late 2013, The Community Foundation of Prince Edward Island (CFPEI)
undertook a survey of over 200 Island youth to identify issues that
directly affect them; the report, T<u>aking
the Pulse of Island Youth</u>,
available on the Foundation<span lang="en-US">’s</span>
website at <u><a href="http://www.cfpei.ca/">www.cfpei.ca</a>,</u>
provides a snapshot of the findings.  Bright
spots include a positive sense of community, emerging entrepreneurial
spirit, volunteerism and new postsecondary offerings. The main
concerns include a lack of jobs, surviving on low-paying jobs,
educational deficiencies and drug and alcohol addictions.  On the
subject of education and learning, the study reports a high rate of
completion of high school and postsecondary education, a high level
of inclusivity and relatively affordable tuition costs; young people
also expressed concerns about their readiness for the next stage of
life including:

</p>
<p align="justify" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Following
the publication of the CFPEI Report, Education 20/20 organized six
public discussions for the purpose of informing the community of the
report and its findings, learning more about youth issues in our
communities, exploring issues of education and learning, and to
identify actions to be taken to close gaps.  Discussions were lively
and wide ranging and carried on well after the formal session ended. 
 Education 20/20 retained an interest in the subject and was
encouraged to resume discussions with providers and users of
educational services following the report of the Council of Ministers
in July of 2016

<p align="center" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">“<i><b>A
student’s ability to transition from secondary school to
post-secondary education and the labour market is a key measure of
the education system’s success for students” –</b></i></p>

</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Transition
through education has been the subject of a number of informal
discussions with educators, employers, students and the community at
large.  It is the writer’s view that, at the minimum, there is an
issue of communication among parties involved or interested in the
subject, a communication gap resulting from the number of service
providers, lack of joint planning and ongoing coordination.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Mathematics
is the study of the science of number, quantity and space; it is in
demand to some degree by all citizens:  employers, institutions and
the community at large. The Oregon Department of Education contends
that math provides “a foundation for the study of science and
technology as well as the interpretation of quantitative information
in other subjects.
Mathematics may
be structured in a number of ways but structure does not appear to
have a particular influence on the quality of instruction.  
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">The
writer is of the view that math is an essential skill needed to some
level by all citizens and can be learned to the citizen level by all
or practically all Islanders.  Furthermore, helping citizens acquire
math skills for citizenship is one of he key roles of our
public-school system but found no agreement, however, as to the
nature and level of citizen math and how it should be determined.</p>

<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><b>MATH
EDUCATION </b>
</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">A
person’s education begins early; the ability to count is often
quoted in reference to a child starting school and is often used by
parents to support a view that their child is “bright”.  At the
same time, many parents, unintentionally I am sure, encourage the
view that math is difficult and the literature tells us that a
person’s beliefs about mathematics can have a substantial impact on
their interest, their enjoyment and their motivation in math classes.

<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Providers
of math instruction: in PEI include:</p>
<ol>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in"><b>The
	public-school system</b>
	plays a key role in increasing and formalizing each student’s
	knowledge of math.  The school system accepts all children and not
	only provides but requires math instruction each year through to
	graduation. Math to be learned is identified for each grade and
	achievement in the time available is reported to parents and the
	public alike. Student results are used to stream students depending
	on the perceived view of the student’s likely career path. 
	Performance across course offerings has become a screening mechanism
	in the transition process.</p></li>

	may be provided by provincial schools and institutions, by employers
	and their organizations or NGO’s on behalf of clients.  Content is
	determined or agreed upon at time of purchase. Except for adult
	upgrading, there appears to be little coordination of math content
	across courses. It doesn’t appear that NGO operators can or do tap

	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Private

	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Individuals
	may study and improve their math skills on their own or with the

LEVELS</b></p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">As
to proficiency levels, there appears to be some agreement that
differences in math levels may be attributed to three factors:</p>
<ol>
	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">The
	number of skills that can be demonstrated</p></li>

<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Grade
levels are established by the Department of Education; individual
student proficiency levels are awarded by teachers.

•	Formative assessment is an
interactive process between student and teacher designed to inform
both parties how well students are learning what teachers are
teaching.  Formative assessment will likely be course or incident
based and sometimes anonymous and not even connected to passing or
grading.</p>

</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in; text-indent: -0.5in">
•	Summative assessment
(evaluation) is a regulatory function responding to society’s
demand for minimum levels of performance in certain life roles and,
therefore, should be carried out by an independent body.  may take
into account more than course content and academic success depending
on its purpose including discussion, cooperation, attendance,
presentation, etc.

<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Outcomes
and competencies are “gradeless” meaning that, at least
theoretically, that any competency can be studied in public school,
college and university.  What changes is the level achieved on each
outcome,</p>

<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><b>RELATED
DEVELOPMENTS </b>
</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">The
following developments have the potential to impact math instruction
in PEI:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">The
	MPHEC adoption of outcomes or competencies when describing
	institutional programs.</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Apparent
	general trend to adopt competencies as a basis for curriculum

	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Emergence
	of dynamic/ holistic rating scales,</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Field

<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><b>CONCLUSIONS</b></p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Based
on the literature, the above noted discussions and the writer’s
experience, the writer concludes that:</p>
<ol>
	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">The
	transition issue cannot be solved by adjustments to the
	public-school system alone</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Math
	instruction in PEI is fragmented</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Grading
	students is not an instructional or school function</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">The
	large number of teachers authorized to grade students increases the
	likelihood of inconsistencies across the system.</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Cooperation
	among providers is hampered by the lack of agreed- upon definitions
	of a number of key concepts. 
	</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Broadly
	speaking, education lacks an overarching statement of philosophy and
	direction; 
	</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">There
	is no formal mechanism for coordination among math providers</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Evaluation
	criteria for math should be the same for all levels of education.</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">The
	way content is described differs from provider to provider.</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Improving
	transition requires cooperation of all math instruction providers.</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Current
	instructional model getting out of date – alignment, curriculum
	map and rating</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">There
