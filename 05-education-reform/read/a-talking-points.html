Reiterates the six life roles framework and emphasizes education as a service system. Provides detailed definitions of key terms and discusses anticipated changes including increased independent learners, adult in-service education, professional autonomy, service expansion beyond schools, government service identification, student choice, accountability, and private sector involvement. Lists priority issues: terminology shift, purpose, services, structure, autonomy, accountability, in-service training, grading, and establishing a PEI Education Association.

<b>INTRODUCTION</b></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><b>It
is widely recognized that education is a key factor in determining
each citizen’s quality of life; in the same way, the collective
education of our citizens will determine to a significant degree the
quality of the communities in which we live. Government support is
justified for two reasons, one to support personal growth and
development for every citizen; the other is to ensure the common
good. Educating is a complex service made so by the fact that each
person is unique in many ways, unique in basic physical, mental,
emotional make-up; unique in the range and nature of previous
experience, unique in perceived futures, but also unique in terms of
learning pace, style and needs. </b>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><b>The
decision to draft this paper arises from discussion with a variety of
stakeholders and the hope of adding clarity to our education
endeavors, I’ve adopted the  view of Oregon Education that each
person fills six life roles – individual, family member, student,
citizen, consumer and producer. Education can support support
students for whichever role they choose.</b></p>

<ol>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
	<b>Terminology-
	change focus from schools to education</b></p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
	<b>Purpose –
	the literature refers to helping people find a place in society;
	that place is a role and should be named or described – a citizen,
	a producer, a consumer or?  Both content and assessment demand it.</b></p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
	<b>Services -
	Education is a service, typical education services include:
	information, counselling, instruction, products and technology,
	quality assurance. governance, funding and human resources. Learners
	may need one or all services at any point in their education journey
	and services should be front and center in our offerings.  Services
	need to be clearly identified and available to all Island citizens
	not only to citizens enrolled in schools and programs.  Whether or
	not all services are paid for by government is a separate issue.</b></p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
	<b>Structure -” Form follows
	function” is still the standard when structuring any venture; one
	would expect, therefore, that the education structure would reflect
	services provided.  Instead, the Department appears to be structured
	around clients served.</b></p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
	<b>Autonomy –
	as mentioned earlier, education is a service.  Front line service
	providers (our teachers) need both the expertise and autonomy to
	respond to learner needs.</b></p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
	<b>Accountability
	- The OECD tells us that PISA results are better for students in
	schools with autonomy for their day-to-day operation; the World Bank
	advises Ministries of Education to delegate. Mathew Bedard of the
	Montreal Economic Institute points out that “autonomy and
	accountability jointly applied” would cost practically nothing and
	allow education to better adapt to the diversity of student needs
	and aptitudes. Yet teachers and principals in PEI appear to have
	little freedom to tailor services to suit individual learner needs.</b></p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
	<b>In-service
	training for teachers</b></p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
	<b>Grades and
	grading, represents an attempt to apply standardized measurement to
	levels of achievement on the education journey. Grades also serve as
	a communication device between a provider and user of a service. 
	The technology allows us to record and track student progress. Most
	developed countries have established qualification bodies to deal
	with the rationalization of credentials and qualifications; Canada
	should consider the same.</b></p></li>
