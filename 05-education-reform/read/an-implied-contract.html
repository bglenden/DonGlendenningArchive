  An implied contract
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Drawing an analogy to professional relationships with lawyers, accountants, and doctors, Don proposes that schools carry an implied commitment to students comparable to the commitment professionals make to clients. He explores what schools might reasonably promise: safe environments, instruction, minimum literacy and numeracy, college-readiness, or employment skills. This foundational letter establishes the contractual thinking that underpins his education advocacy and reflects his belief in accountability and clear institutional commitments.</div>

<p>Editor,</p>

<p><br></p>
<p>Dear Sir:</p>
<p><b>An implied contract</b></p>
<p>In the case of my lawyer, my accountant and my doctor I believe that, once they accept me as a client, they are obligated to do whatever they can reasonably do to solve my “problem”; they may help me directly, hand me over to a colleague or employee, or refer me to a specialist.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The commitment by the firm, I assume, will depend on the how the firm is organized. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>I believe that there is a similar implied commitment to each student by a teacher and a school, but I am less clear as to what the commitment is for.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My scan of the internet was not very helpful although one school indicated that a student has a right to “be educated (and) become a productive member of the community”. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>What might a school commitment be to each student?</p>
<p>A safe environment<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>190 days of instruction?</p>
<p>Instruction in a variety of subjects?</p>
<p>A minimum level of literacy or numeracy?</p>
<p>A high school diploma</p>
<p>Skills needed to enter college and university?</p>
<p>Skills needed to enter work?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>We require our young people to attend school and we invest heavily in educational programming; what should each student expect in return? <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
