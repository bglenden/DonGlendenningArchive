  A Wilmot-2
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Detailed letter from Don to Louise and Jim Wilmot describing four separate garden program proposals: Souris Sprouts-2 (repeat of 2016 program with 20 students), Green Spaces (indoor living spaces for school), Program promotion (island-wide presentations), and Camp Bean (competitive challenge for island schools). Don outlines the evolution from direct Education 20/20 operation to fund &quot;flow-through&quot; arrangements with Souris Regional School or town council, citing CFPEI precedents. He emphasizes breaking down school &quot;silos&quot; through broader community engagement. The letter reveals Don&#x27;s sophisticated understanding of organizational structures, his commitment to community partnership, and his vision for scaling successful initiatives. His personal investment in teachers Sarah and Ilse is evident throughout.</div>

<div class="reader-content">
<p>Dear Louise and Jim:</p>
<p>Trust that you arrived back in Florida safely and that all is well; we’ve had great fall weather – still no sign of frost but our rain barrels are full.</p>
<p>As you know, we met with Sarah and Ilse and have exchanged a number of notes and drafts on possible projects; attached is a copy of the most recent.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We’ve prepared the attachment as four separate proposals (any one could be offered alone) so that you can select any and all that interest you; in our view; all are worthwhile.</p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li1"><b>Souris Sprouts -2</b></li>
</ul>
<p>A proven product; a repeat of the 2016 initiative; 20 instead of 40 students; may well find local funding even if you did not support it; some other schools do something similar.</p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li1"><b>Green Spaces</b></li>
</ul>
<p>A natural evolution from their initial work with the Souris Sprouts; for children who took basic program last year; limited to 20 students; quite manageable; potential to spread to other schools.</p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li1"><b>Program promotion</b></li>
</ul>
<p>Broadens their experience and influence; could be seen as a bit of a reward; could help break the “silo” mentality of educators; could be a factor in a “leaders’” rise in their profession;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li1"><b>Camp Bean</b></li>
</ul>
<p>Innovative; fun; expands their role, expands organizational and leadership skills; entrepreneurial</p>
<p>Our initial thinking was that the project be operated directly by Education 20/20; as we worked it through, however, this option appeared more bureaucratic than was necessary.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We are now proposing that, once a project is agreed upon,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>the money be transferred to either the Souris Regional School (where they have very close working relationship) or the town of Souris to be dispensed as per the project description and budget.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>CFPEI has similar arrangements with the City of Charlottetown for Ghiz Park improvements. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>We’ve checked with the Community Foundation and they are quite happy to facilitate the project.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I should point out however that Funds of this nature are considered “flow through” and CFPEI charges a administrative fee of, I think, two percent.</p>
<p>As you may recall, many of us are concerned about the “silos” in which schools operate.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Subject to your approval, but without commitment, we would like to continue to work with Sarah and Ilsa with a view engaging them more broadly in the educational activities of the community in future projects</p>
<p>Let me know if you have questions or need further information</p>
<p>Thanks for your interest and support</p>
<p>Warmest regards.</p>
<p>Don</p>
