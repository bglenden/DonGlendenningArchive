  14 News 3 Let- Implied contract
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Letter to Charlottetown Guardian (February 12, 2017) examining implicit contracts between educational institutions and students. Don references student guarantee programs at University of Regina and warranty programs at Canadian colleges, where students can return tuition-free if they lack employment-ready skills. He distinguishes between education as service (teachers helping students learn) versus education as product (institutions granting credentials). The document raises critical questions about institutional accountability and the distinction between credentials and qualifications, reflecting his deep engagement with education accountability frameworks.</div>

<p>Editor,</p>
<p>Charlottetown Guardian</p>
<p>Charlottetown, PEI	</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Dear Sir:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>	<b>The education contract</b><b></b></p>
<p>A few days ago, I came across an article about a student Guarantee Program at the University of Regina under which students, who do not find a full time job within six months of graduation, may return tuition free for an additional year of undergraduate study. I was reminded of a Canadian College that introduced a warranty program a number of years ago under which students<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>from the college who lacked skills for employment or certification in a field for which they had trained, could return to the College free of charge to fill the gaps.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And then there are the conversations I overhear about Island students who plan their high schools program in a way to take advantage of upgrading courses at Holland College – and perhaps even receive an allowance while doing it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>All of which raises issues as to the role of schools and postsecondary institutions and their accountability.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>One may argue that education is either a product or service; when I think of teachers helping students to read, calculate and operate equipment, I think of education as a service.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>On the other hand, when an institution hands a student a diploma or a degree, the relationship changes; the institution is treating graduates as products. It also seems to me that when an employer or postsecondary its entrance requirements like “high school graduation” must have completed Math 621 reinforces the product analogy</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>All this arises out of trying to sort out the accountability of schools and the school system.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Don Glendenning</p>
<p>A long-time student of education</p>
