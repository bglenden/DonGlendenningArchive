<div class="reader-summary">An occasional paper recommending comprehensive educational system reform in Prince Edward Island. Glendenning calls for a clear provincial vision of education, learner-centered service models, delegation of instruction to diverse providers, establishment of a qualification authority, and a professional service delivery model with greater educator autonomy and accountability.</div>

	<h1 style="margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: 0in"><span style="font-weight: normal">Preparation
	for life’s roles is called education and the better prepared we
	are, the better we are able to cope with all that we encounter, or
	create.  And education is made more complex by the fact that each
	person is unique; unique in basic physical, mental, emotional and
	social make up, unique in range and nature of previous experience,
	unique in perceived futures, but also unique in terms of learning
	pace, style and needs. Our education consists of what we have
	learned or perhaps even more accurately what we can do as a result
	of what we have learned</span></h1>

	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><a name="_GoBack"></a>
	It is widely recognized that education
	is a key factor in determining each citizen’s quality of life; in
	the same way, the collective education of our citizens will
	determine to a significant degree the quality of the community in
	which we live.  Our government supports education for two reasons,
	one is to ensure a high level of personal growth and development for
	every citizen; the other is to ensure the common good.

	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">There
	is a gap between what Islanders have and what they want in the way
	of education.  Indicators of the gap include: the limited engagement
	between educators and the community they serve; the lack of a
	philosophy of education that encompasses all our citizens;
	government’s focus on the young and schooling; service gaps such
	as the availability of independent information on which to make
	educational choices; availability of part time instruction; lack of
	market conditions normal for a sector; politicization of decision
	making and limits on professional autonomy and accountability.
	Citizens see most of the issues as organizational, created by
	government decision-makers and, therefore, capable of being changed
	by those same government decision-makers.

	</p>
	<ol>
		<li><p style="orphans: 2; margin-bottom: 0in; widows: 2; line-height: 100%">
		As
		an immediate step, Government engage in the development of a short,
		clear, overarching, public statement about education, who it is
		for, its guiding principles and basic beliefs.  Although much has
		been written about education, a comprehensive vision statement does
		not currently exist for PEI. We believe that having such a
		statement is required, especially for a service as large and
		complex as education, however, we are not suggesting another study
		but rather a document prepared by a small working with opportunity
		for citizen input.</p></li>

		Develop
		a learner centered service model that provides support in all
		domains to learners as, when and where needed.  Doing so would
		involve student centered outcomes, criterion referenced assessment,
		flexible scheduling, challenge for credit arrangements, and greater
		autonomy and accountability for teachers. 
		</p></li>
		<li><p style="orphans: 2; margin-bottom: 0in; widows: 2; line-height: 100%">
		Government
		reserve for itself a leadership role in creating a learning culture
		and providing a quality education for every Islander.  Such a role
		is important but currently lacking, and education suffers as a
		result. Government should  focus on matters of planning, setting
		priorities, funding, monitoring, quality control, ensuring the
		availability of professional resources, home support for preschool
		children,  information and continuing education. Under such an
		arrangement, the Department may well play an increased role in
		delivering support to families with pre- school children, more
		active role in promoting and offering continuing education classes
		and even in providing information and services to children and
		their parents.</p></li>

		Establish a
		qualification authority, a separate body for the purpose certifying
		individual levels of achievement to persons wanting or needing such
		documentation.  The role of teaching is to help others learn; when
		a teachers rank their students they are putting their ability to
		teach at risk; assigning student grades, selecting students for
		prizes and awards and awarding diplomas and degrees is a sorting
		process and should not be part of a teacher’s role. 
		Apprenticeship with certification through a Provincial Department
		of Labour and music through the Royal Canadian Music conservatory
		are examples of the preferred arrangement.
