</p>
<p lang="en-CA" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">
Without doubt, education is
important, changes are needed, and there is wide support for change
both inside and outside the system; on the other hand, proposed
<span lang="en-US">changes
fail to deal with a number of underlying weaknesses such as autonomy,
accountability and the mismatch between skills taught and skills
needed.  In addition, </span>required
changes are not likely to happen unless the public, you and I, demand
it. Traditional efforts to bring about change have not worked.  Some
innovative, perhaps even bold, measures are required, but we think
that a better education system is worth it.  
</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><br />

</p>
<p lang="en-CA" style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">During
the past few months, I’ve been working with a small group of
Islanders who share these views and are willing to devote time and
energy to the change process.   The group, Education 20/20 Inc. is a
broadly based, nationally incorporated, not-for-profit education
organization, located in Charlottetown, PEI.  It is governed
by a volunteer Board of Directors; people who have demonstrated an
interest in and knowledge of education but are not representative of
any educational constituency.   To date, we have:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Held
	consultations with education officials, met with both Home and
	School Federations (English and French) the PEI Professional
	Engineers Association, been in touch with other organizations  and
	held conversations with individuals and small groups from every walk
	of life.</p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Held
	two public workshops in Charlottetown</p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Published
	a monthly electronic newsletter and occasional papers, and have</p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">A
	website about to be launched</p></li>
</ul>
<p lang="en-CA" style="margin-bottom: 0.14in"><br />
<br />

</p>
<p lang="en-CA" style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">In
the New Year, we will be:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Teaming
	up with the Community Foundation of Prince Edward Island to organize
	public discussions about issues facing Island youth – many of
	which are related to education.</p></li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Announcing
	an award for an Island school, or family of schools, that best
	demonstrates engagement in its every-day activities.  
	</p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Undertaking
	 surveys of users of educational services.</p></li>
</ul>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><br />

</p>
<p lang="en-CA" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">
Our group cannot make this
happen alone and, while we are appreciative of general support
received to date, at the moment we are seeking $1,500 to cover out of
pocket costs for the five workshops throughout the Island.

nationally we do not, as yet, have charitable status.  Contributions,
therefore, should be directed to <span lang="en-US">Community
Foundation of Prince Edward Island, 119 Queen Street, Charlottetown,
