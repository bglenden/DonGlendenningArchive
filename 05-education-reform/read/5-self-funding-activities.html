<div class="reader-summary">Don explores potential self-funding service delivery models for Education 20/20 including coding instruction, Handle-With-Care programming, self-development courses, and professional development. Reflects his thinking about sustainable, market-responsive education services beyond traditional offerings.</div>

<p><b>Self-funding activities</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>From time to time the matter of direct delivery of services has come up, we should talk about it to determine the size and nature of the need/interest and is we can or should do something about it. Some examples:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Coding</b></p>
<p>The importance of knowing a computer language is not in question; how we meet the growing demand is still unclear.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There is a growing interest and need for instruction for all ages. Maureen Kerr ‘s experience illustrates the issue; she has tapped into a niche, expanded all ages need for an organization to handle the administrative side.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Handle With Care</b></p>
<p>Alice and I have had some conversations about both the need for and funding possibilities for this program.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Self- development courses<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p>I’m struck by an apparent lack of part time education other than credit courses; perhaps there is more available than I realize.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Continuing professional development</b></p>
<p>Seems to me that we have a cadre of educators on PEI whose skills could be tapped in terms of educational reform</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Such a service could be available for people of any age; it could be a continuing education model like Senior’s College; there is supplemental education for the young; then there are all the employed people.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There are no end of possibilities – even that of certification.</p>
