  Confusion in Literacy terms@2016-04-27T15;52;51
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Don proposes standardizing literacy terminology and assessment levels across PEI&#x27;s multiple education agencies and programs. He argues that while various literacy initiatives exist in high schools, adult programs, and workforce development, the lack of unified definitions and consistent level frameworks creates confusion and inefficiency. Don advocates for a common provincial framework to improve communication, curriculum sharing, assessment standards, and student transitions.</div>

<p><b>Make literacy less confusing</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>I find literacy confusing; I’m prepared to use any definition but it would be nice if, at least in PEI, we could agree on a meaning.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Sometimes I confuse literacy with basic education, citizenship skills, Basic Training for Skill Development and even with Adult Basic Education.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Let me try to explain.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>The Department of Education and Early Childhood Education introduced a Secondary Literacy<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Assessment (SLA) of levels achieved by the end of Grade 9; it includes two elements, Reading and Writing.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The system also offers a Secondary Literacy Course, presumably including the same two subjects and, it appears one must successfully pass the SLA or the course in order to graduate.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The Department of Workforce and Advanced Learning also offers literacy training which appears to include Adult Basic Education (Biology, Chemistry, English, GED Preparation, Math and Physics), GED, PEI School Graduation Certificate for mature students, and GED instruction.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Also , the PEI Literacy Association refers to four kinds of literacy, prose, document and quantitative or numeracy.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I understand and support all of these efforts, my only point is that it would be helpful if the three agencies used the same version.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Then there is the matter of levels of literacy; the high school program has three levels,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>adult literacy program identifies five levels. and there may be other schemes.</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>It seems to me that standardizing the terminology and levels of literacy within the provincial setting would improve both communication and understanding.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>An analysis would, I am sure, produce the same outcomes or skills, the criteria should be the same, the number of levels could be adjusted to serve all Islanders. A common framework would allow for shares curriculum development, present a common “language” to all ages, allow for better student flow, confirm a common set of criteria during assessment and even form a common basis for transcripts.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Perhaps above all, working through such a project could provide a great professional development from all levels and institutions.</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Sincerely</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
