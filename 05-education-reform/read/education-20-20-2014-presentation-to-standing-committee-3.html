20/20 is a national, not-for-profit education organization, located
in Charlottetown, PEI. We are governed by a volunteer Board of
Directors, comprised of people who have demonstrated an interest in
and knowledge of education, but are not representative of an
educational constituency. Our mission is to improve the quality of
education for every Canadian. Our activities to date have included
newsletters, workshops, Facebook, a website and an award to an Island
school for demonstrating a high level of activities in its day to day
operation..</b></span></p>

</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><span lang="en-US"><b>First
a few words about education.  We see education as one of the most
important issues of the day. An issue that confronts parents,
students, teachers, teaching and learning experts and everyday
Canadians concerned with the challenges we encounter within our
system and beyond.  Education is the force that shapes who we are as
individuals; shapes our communities and our country.  It is our view
that with a quality education, many of our other problems would be
reduced and some even eliminated</b></span></p>

<br />

</p>
<p align="justify" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><span lang="en-US"><b>To
start our presentation, we’d like to make a few comments about
education itself. Education is a complex matter and it is important
that we all start from a common base; or perhaps more accurately,
that you know where we are coming from.  The brochure we handed out
provides some working definitions; they may not be the ones you see
in text books or dictionaries but we consider them working
definitions for every day use.</b></span></p>
<p align="justify" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><br />

</p>
<p align="justify" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><b>In
a nutshell, </b>
</p>
<ul>
	<li><p align="justify" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">
	<b>education is any </b>experience that has a formative effect on
	the way we feel, think and act; 
	</p></li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li><p align="justify" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">
	<b>Its purpose is </b>to help each of us gain the attitudes, skills,
	knowledge needed help us cope with, enjoy and contribute to the
	situations we find ourselves in for the rest of our lives. 
	</p></li>
	<li><p align="justify" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">
	<b>Education starts in the home  with family being the main source
	of instruction, help and influence</b></p></li>
	<li><p align="justify" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">
	<b>Our community invests heavily in schools for two purposes, </b>to
	help individual Islanders develop their full potential and to ensure
	that our community has the <i>skills needed to grow and prosper</i> 
	</p></li>
	<li><p align="justify" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">
	<b>When we learn, we change, and those changes  may include </b>changing
	the way we think, feel and act</p></li>
	<li><p align="justify" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">
	<b>The role of a teacher is to help us change  from what we are to
	what we want to be –</b> to gain new information, gain new skills
	or change the way we  feel</p></li>
</ul>
<p align="justify" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><br />

</p>
<p align="justify" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><b>So
education and schooling are not the same, one becomes educated
whether or not one attends school, education is more than the
acquisition of knowledge, and being educated is a process of changing
behaviour.  </b>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><br />

</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><span lang="en-US"><b>But
the world outside schools is changing.  While core citizenship skills
are as important as ever, the emphasis on the transfer of knowledge
has been upstaged by information technology; the core of current
school activities is available unfiltered at our fingertips, while
the number of skilled workers in our plants continues to decline
those in the field continue to grow, the importance of the early
years and the right start is now recognized as never before, the
global workplace demands people with interpersonal and cultural
sensitivities as never before.  As we speak, events in the Middle
East give an urgency to developing the skills of citizenship.</b></span></p>
<p lang="en-US" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><br />

</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><span lang="en-US"><b>There
is a widespread call for change although perhaps not a clarion call –
at least not yet.  It demands a return to education not just a
revitalization of schools.  At the broadest level, we need to rethink
education, its components, its services, and how best to make  them
available to every citizen.  Obviously, schools will continue to be
needed but education tomorrow will likely be community not school
based. What do we want schools to do? How do we engage and harness
other community agencies in the education process.  But we also need
to rethink about who does what and for whom.</b></span></p>
<p lang="en-US" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><br />

</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><span lang="en-US"><b>The
community is calling for change; so far, organized education appears
not to have heard the call.  Or if it has heard, is ignoring the
call, or decided not to engage the community in the change process. 
The question is where should change start.  We believe that the place
to start is with a set of broad principles.  If we get them right,
individual decisions are easier to make and helps reduce
inconsistencies. </b></span>
</p>
<p lang="en-US" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><br />

</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><span lang="en-US"><b>Change
can begin anywhere; the kind of change required, however, demands a
review and restatement of our guiding principles.  We’ve found a
number of overarching statements about education; the one below draws
heavily on a couple of </b></span><b>OECD and  UNICEF reports.  They
are not </b>a perfest set of criteria but provide a good jumping off
point for further discussion.

<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0.14in"><br />

<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">A

specific recommendation to this committee it would be that you engage
the community in a direct  but simple exercise of reviewing and
restating a set of beliefs about education to guide us until our 200

schools.</p>

<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">In
Newsletter No. 10, we reported on characteristics of a quality
education published in a 2000 UNICEF report.  We’ve since reviewed
some OECD and UNESCO document and have expanded the list.  A quality
education system is one Teachers are professional, autonomous and
accountable</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0.14in"><br />
<br />

</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">To
put them in perspective, these characteristics would apply  to a
province, any province; the extent to which any or all would apply to
a school district or to a school will depend upon how a province
organizes its education support services..

</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-left: 0.75in; margin-bottom: 0in">
The strength of these
characteristics, over others I have seen, is their focus on learners
and learning.  Havin</p>
