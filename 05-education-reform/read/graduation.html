  Graduation
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">A refined version of Don&#x27;s graduation philosophy, emphasizing that schools should prepare students to live fully—enjoying life, making a living, and contributing to communities. Don contrasts the university-focused orientation of secondary schools with the reality that up to half of graduates pursue work directly. He presents Michigan&#x27;s outcome-based graduation requirements as superior to traditional discipline-based models, arguing that schools should answer the question: what should graduates be able to do? The essay champions outcome-focused education over subject-centered curricula.</div>

<b>HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATION</b></p>
<p align="center" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">We
need a lively debate about the meaning of high school graduation. 
What does it mean to be a high school graduate?  What should we
expect a high school graduate to be able to do?  These are basic
questions; perhaps that is why they are seldom asked.  Until we deal
with that question, answers to other questions about school matters
will remain fuzzy.  From time to time there is a flurry of interest
in how well our students do in comparison to students in other
countries but, such flurries are usually short lived.  My thinking on
the subject runs something like this.  
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">The
role of schools is to prepare young people to live life to the
fullest, which includes enjoying life, making a living and
contributing to their communities.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Schools,
on the other hand, see their roles as preparing people for further
education, they look to colleges and universities for direction as to
what should be taught at the secondary school level.  They have that
focus even though a large percentage, perhaps even up to one-half, do
not go to college or university but go directly into the community or
to work.  As evidence, publicity about graduates and graduations
emphasizes high grades, academic awards and acceptance at
universities; little is said about success of graduates going
directly to work.  
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Given
this orientation, it is natural that secondary schools look to
colleges and universities to determine what should be taught or
learned in high schools – subjects that meet university and college
entrance requirements..  Universities organize around disciplines,
therefore, secondary school organize around disciplines also.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">  
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Typically
students are required to gain credits in the following subjects in
order to graduate from high school:</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

<p style="margin-left: 1in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">If
schools were more focused on what students will do when they leave
school, they would look to the community to determine what should be
taught.  For example, Oregon Education Act for the 21<sup>st</sup>
Century identifies the following life roles we all fill: individual,
learner, producer, citizen, consumer and family member.  The state of
Michigan, on the other hand, states their high school graduation
requirements as (State of Michigan on August 22, 1990):</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"> 
</p>
<ol>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
	Students will be proficient in listening, speaking, reading,
	writing, mathematics, and the use of technology. 
	</p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
	Students will apply knowledge, concepts, and processes acquired
	through the study of the arts, sciences, and social sciences. 
	</p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
	Students will demonstrate a healthy self-esteem. 
	</p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
	Students will select and use thinking skills, individually and in
	groups, to solve problems and to make decisions. 
	</p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
	Students will be able to find, evaluate and use information. 
	</p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
	Students will demonstrate respect and co-operation within a
	community of individual and cultural differences. 
	</p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
	Students will demonstrate personal, social, civic, and environmental
	responsibility. 
	</p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
	Students will be self-directed learners who are adaptable to change.
		</p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
	Students will demonstrate a positive work ethic. 
	</p></li>
</ol>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">In
my views, the latter is a clearer statement of what to expect of a
high school graduate and a better reflection of preparation for life.</p>
