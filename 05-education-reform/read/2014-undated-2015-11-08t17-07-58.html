  <li class="li2"><span>Math gap</span>:  Iâ€™ve mentioned discussions about the â€œmath gapâ€ reported by students when seeking entrance to postsecondary studies or to work; I convened a group in early January to discuss the issue; have also had some discussion with Chamber of Commerce; next step is to find out what math skills employers want/ need; since our meeting I met with Lori Johnston of Workplace Learning PEI (<span>www.workplacelearningpei.com</span>) who has a lot of experience in working with employers and employees; I think that she has information that employers should know about; she has agreed to host a small session but it is a very busy time of year and weâ€™ve had many stormy days; in the meantime, Iâ€™m continuing to gather information.<span><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></li>
  <li class="li3"></li>
  <li class="li2"><span>Learning path</span>: Tim, Mike Chapman and I reworked the learning path a couple of times; I have a meeting with Holly Moses and ECE students at Holland College on February 12 at 9:00 am to discuss learning path;( discussed with Tim and decided to go directly to ECE Department rather than through Tim.)  Looking forward to getting studentâ€™s reaction and input; tentative arrangements with Tess Miller about meeting with some UPEI students but arrangements not confirmed yet. Would be happy to have one or two accompany me.<span><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></li>
