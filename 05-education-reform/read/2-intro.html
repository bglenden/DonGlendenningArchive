<div class="reader-summary">Don&#x27;s personal introduction explaining his unique educational trajectory—a &quot;sandwich education&quot; spanning 20 years combining teaching and study. He details his credentials as elementary/secondary teacher, principal, teacher trainer, and federal training specialist, alongside advanced degrees. He credits this diverse background as preparation for founding Holland College in 1969. The piece articulates his conviction that educational change must come from public demand rather than from within the system. He published his first Guardian letter in 1995 and compiled approximately 62 published letters over 18 years, viewing this collection as stimulus for public discussion and debate about educational reform. Emphasizes community engagement and citizen demand as catalysts for systemic change.</div>

<p>Dear Reader:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>The Glendenning Letters</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>Mine was a sandwich education spread over 20 years after high school graduation. A layer of</p>
<p>Study, perhaps a year or two, followed by a layer of teaching, then another layer of study and so</p>
<p>on, all seasoned with endless summer schools. As a result, I ended up with experience as a</p>
<p>teacher in both the elementary and secondary levels, a principal, six years a teacher</p>
<p>trainer and the same as a training specialist with the Federal government. During the same</p>
<p>period I earned several degrees, and held licenses to teach both academic and vocational</p>
<p>subjects. That sandwich nourished me in my role as Founding President of Holland College, a</p>
<p>community college established in Prince Edward lsland to broaden the range of educational</p>
<p>services available to lslanders. I write this only to support the view that my sandwich was</p>
<p>custom made, was somewhat unique and may result in a different perspective than that of others.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>For a number of years I wrote a column for the Canadian Vocational Journal. ln 1995 I wrote my first letter to the Editor of the Charlottetown Guardian; it was about education in Atlantic</p>
<p>Canada and is the first letter in the pages that follow. That letter was a simple response to an</p>
<p>item of interest; 18 years later with our education system under scrutiny and pressure to</p>
<p>change, a friend suggested that these letters be brought together and made available to the</p>
<p>public as a stimulus for discussion. This volume is the result.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I found or reconstructed some 62 letters, all of which were actually published; there were</p>
<p>perhaps a half dozen not included because they were short and congratulatory notes, were not</p>
<p>about education, were sent to a different newspaper, or may not have been published. I also</p>
<p>found an equal number of letters in various stages of readiness; some of the latter look more</p>
<p>interesting than the published ones. Most of the letters would have benefitted from editing,</p>
<p>rewriting or even not having been written at all but I decided to include them anyway. I</p>
<p>suppose I shouldn't have been surprised by number that were repeats.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Readers may wonder why I write letters to the editor instead of writing for educational journals.</p>
<p>The answer is twofold, I do not consider myself a writer neither do I have the interest or</p>
<p>discipline to write a book. But secondly, I am of the view that the changes required in</p>
<p>education are not likely to come from within the system but rather will result from demands for</p>
<p>change arising from interested parents, citizens, students, employers and the public at large.</p>
<p>Putting these letters in circulation is, I believe a contribution to that debate.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>My thanks to all who, over the years, contributed to the ideas expressed herein; I hope they</p>
<p>contribute as much to your education as they did to mine.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
<p><br></p>

<p>The Government provides opportunity, encouragement, teachers and other resources to assist students</p>
<p>to obtain a quality education but only learners can learn. lt is a responsibility of learners, or their</p>
<p>parents, to ensure that learners take advantage of the resources. Teachers certainly play a role in</p>
<p>motivating students" Students make individual decisions about if what, when, how and how much they</p>
<p>learn; even when we are teaching, learners may be learning something quite different from what is</p>
<p>intended"</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>As for transportation, there are at last two separate points of decision-making. People providing the bus</p>
<p>service, or the operators themselves, should decide whether or not it is safe to drive. lf conditions are</p>
<p>unsafe, buses should stay off the road and students along the route should be informed of the change of</p>
<p>plans. Even when buses are operating, parents are the ones to decide each day whether or not their</p>
<p>child gets on the bus. lf bus transportation is not available, a parent may arrange alternative</p>
<p>transportation if they know the school is open.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Frequently I am asked if the above policies will not result in some students being ahead or behind others</p>
<p>and if the gap will widen. This implies that students in the same grade are at the same level of</p>
<p>achievement and move forward in a lock-step fashion. This is far from the case. ln any class, some</p>
<p>students are ahead and others behind the average - whatever average means. The system copes with</p>
<p>students who lose a day due to illness, why can't it also cope with a student who loses a day due to bad</p>
<p>weather? Granted the number of absentees may be larger on a storm day, but the problem remains</p>
<p>essentially the same.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Closing schools on stormy days is administratively convenient but I believe is disruptive to students and</p>
<p>learning. The decision to attend or not attend on any given day belongs to the student and/or parents. I</p>
<p>am quite satisfied that teachers are both willing and able to deal with school absences in a less</p>
<p>disruptive fashion. .</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
