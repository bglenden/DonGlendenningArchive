There is a large unserved and even growing body of people engaged in
education outside public institutions; I refer to a dozen agencies on
PEI part of whose educational programs have been accepted by the
Department of Education for external credits, some private schools,
home schooling parents, employer based training and a number of
organizations receiving funding to mount programs for underserved
youth.  Education 20/20 Inc. plans to address that need through a
series of webinar-style  3-5 minute video clips for use by educators
either alone or in groups.  Our first series, “A Learning
Framework” is under development and consists of four sessions:  
</p>
<ul>
	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><b>Learners</b>

</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">It takes an informed
and engaged community to educate a child; evidence shows that
students perform better in schools where parents and the community
work together; there is a movement towards greater engagement with
community organizations; in PEI, during the last few months, the
Department of education has dramatically expanded the number of
external credits.  Education 20/20 would like to see cooperation
between schools and other community organizations expanded even
further.  We plan  to:

</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><u><b>Work with
employers:</b></u></p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">About a year ago,
the Community Foundation of Prince Edward Island conducted a survey
of over 200 young people to better understand their issues. 
(<u><a href="http://www.CFPEI.ca/">www.CFPEI.ca</a></u>).
 On reviewing their report, Education 20/20 was struck by the
“preparedness gap”, that is the preparedness of young people for
further education and for work.   Early in 2014, Education 20/20 Inc.
organized workshops in six communities across the Island to publicize
the findings, determine the extent of the concern, and identify
actions, if any, that could or should be taken. Perhaps the most
significant finding was the lack of communication about educational
matters between providers and users of educational services.  Survey
results have informed the following activities: 
</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><br />

</p>
<ol>
	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Working with
	employers and educators seeking alternative ways for employers to
	obtain the information they want about an applicant’s basic
	skills.  A mechanism for PEI is now emerging that will see the
	<u>Holland College Assessment Centre</u> and <u>Workplace Learning
	PEI</u> offer a testing service for employers and employees.    
	</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Development of
	a  “math ladder” as an alternative to grade-level outcomes and
	high school marks, as a way define levels of achievement.  Based on
	discussions to date with employers, UPEI and Holland College, the
	likely outcome will be a system, similar to that practiced in music,
	whereby the establishment of levels is handled by the Royal Canadian
	Conservatory of Music rather than local teachers of music;
	exploration continues.</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">One of the
	conclusions resulting from our preparedness workshops is the need
	for direct dialogue between education and the community it serves. 
	To bridge the gap, we are organizing a series of discussions, each
	session will have a one page background paper, a presentation if
	appropriate, followed by open discussion.  The objective is to
	increase communications rather than to reach agreement.  The pilot
	run of discussions will begin in early 2015 between 4:30 and 6:00 pm
	with a group not to exceed 20 people; additional groups will be
	organized if numbers warrant.</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">We will
	continue to engage employers and educators in projects and panels to
	increase communication; service clubs will be encouraged to invite
	educators, especially principals, as speakers, and will make a
	special attempt to produce occasional papers and media releases
	about items of interest to them.

community-based education organizations</b></u></p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><br />

</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">We are all familiar
with schools, colleges and universities as providers of educational
services; we are less familiar with, and often overlook, the many
other providers of educational services including youth
organizations, cadet programs, sports development programs, etc.  
More to the point, staff in these groups are seldom included in
conferences, workshops or other educational activities.  Education
20/20  Inc. views them as an important and growing segment of our
education system and will actively recruit their participation in
ongoing activities but also survey them as to their needs and
interests.</p>

community at large</b></p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><br />

</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Parents play a
pivotal role in the education of their children; children perform
better when their parents and the community are engaged in the
education process and yet, broadly speaking, the school system does
not encourage deep engagement.  To encourage engagement, Education
20/20 Inc. has instituted an award of Excellence to a school or
learning centre that best demonstrates a high level of engagement in
its day to day activities, especially those activities over which the
school has control.  (Announcements, descriptions and other
supporting information provided with supporting documents).

<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><br />

</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Surveys of parents
and other stakeholders are being planned:</p>

	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">A survey of

EDUCATION BY CATERING TO NEEDS OF LIFE-LONG LEARNERS:</b></p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><br />

</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">There are a number
of significant gaps in our instructional services:</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><br />

</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><b>Continuing
Education </b>
</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><br />

</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Education is a
lifelong process; most of our educational funding goes to
institutions and for the education of the young.  But in rapidly
changing times and internationalization of the business world,
continuing education becomes even more important.  Although
technology has put knowledge building within reach of many adults,
maintaining and progressing in the workplace may also require new
skills and attitudes that can best be dealt with in group settings.
Our first step will be to undertake a survey to better define the
gap.  With that in hand, we can develop a plan of action.  Terms of
reference for such a study are now being written.</p>

<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><br />

</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">We have identified
at least two groups of young people who need help: 
</p>
<ul>
	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">One group with
	a high school graduation diploma but insufficient skills to enter
	further studies or work.  Education 20/20 plans to help by offering
	a tutoring program fashioned on the Sunshine tutoring program
	offered in Dartmouth Nova Scotia.  Each session will be of two hours
	duration once a week from 4-6:00 pm. Tutors will be volunteers;
	space has been offered by the PEI Association of Professional
	Engineers; costs will be minimal and will be met through donations
	from individuals and businesses.  If demand warrants, we will grow
	this service into a full service study centre where youth can get
	customized help to meet their particular needs.  That help may be as
	simple as counselling and advice but also may include diagnosis,
	access to resources, tutoring, counselling or referral to another
	source of help.   Our longer term plan is to expand the service as
	needed and as resources allow including career information
	counselling and advice but also may include diagnosis, access to
	resources, tutoring, counselling or referral to another source of
	help.   The services may be expanded to other communities</p></li>

	with the skills that employers need/want but do not have the
	documentation to prove it.  Education 20/20 Inc. is actively engaged
	with the business and education communities (Holland College, the
	University of Prince Edward Island, and community educational
	organizations) seeking a resolution to the problem. The resources
	and good will are available in the community; information and
