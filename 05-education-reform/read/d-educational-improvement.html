  D Educational improvement
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Dated December 1, 2010, this substantive letter distinguishes education from schooling and argues improvement must focus on individual learning at the teacher-student interface. Don contends schools teach subjects while learners need skill development (communication, social, analytical). He critiques school grades as administrative conveniences lacking real meaning. He argues work habits should be rated on report cards and advocates allowing students to challenge courses for credit once standards are met, reducing the role of time-based progression.</div>

<p>Dear Sir:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>More Effective Schooling</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Lately, it seems, I have encountered an unusual number of people who want to talk about education.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Other than Homberg University, most conversations dealt with issues of reading, literacy, report cards, school attendance and work habits and standards.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Rather than talk about the problem, I like to comment on<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>solutions – especially the place to start the improvement process.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Let’s start the improvement process by changing our focus from education to schooling; the two are not the same and using the words interchangeably is confusing.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We’ve established schools, students go to school, teachers work in schools, schools provide report cards on what students learn while they are in school. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>No two learners arrive at school at the same stage of development, and the differences will widen rather than narrow the longer learners stay in school.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Learning is an individual matter although it may take place in a group setting.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>School grades, therefore, are an administrative convenience and mean little in terms of what an individual student knows or is able to do. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Learning is about changing behaviour.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Changes are observable and may occur in attitude, knowledge or skill.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Parents send their children to school to improve their communication skills, improve social skills, develop skills of analysis and problem solving, prepare them for being self-sufficient and to earn a living, and to enable them to maintain a reasonable quality of life.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Teachers teach subjects; it is difficult for parentlearn skills required to be a dividual comments, perhaps even complaints, were legitimate but I’m not given to stopping there.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I wondered as I was driving home, where one might start to address the issues they raised.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is my view that the focus for improvement can only start with the learner and the learning-teaching process.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Why do people go to school?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>What are their expectations or the expectations of their parents?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>All would agree, I believe that one expectation is that each student will be able to demonstrate a reasonable level of communication skills before being granted a high school diploma. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Schools, on the other hand, teach and report student performance on English; they infer that satisfactory performance on English means a satisfactory level of communication skills.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It isn’t so.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Developing a common set<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>of expectations in this area alone would be a significant step in improving schooling.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The issue of work habits came up in one conversation.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Should schools be expected to teach “work habits”?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A recent news item about Nova Scotia suggested that, at least in some schools, student grades may be lowered because of poor attendance.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The logic of that decision escapes me.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I certainly would support the idea, however, of<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>allowing students to challenge for credit and allowing them to leave school as soon as credit is earned.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I should hasten to point out that I believe that work habits are very important, perhaps even more important than some of the required subjects.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Because of that importance, I suggest that<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>work habits be added to the report card and given a rating.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
<p><br></p>
