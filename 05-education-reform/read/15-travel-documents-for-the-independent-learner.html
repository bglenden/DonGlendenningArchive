  15 Travel documents for the independent learner
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Using his family&#x27;s travel experiences as metaphor, Don proposes &quot;travel documents&quot; for independent learners including curriculum maps, learning models, learning guides, and learning plans. He contrasts the travel industry&#x27;s flexibility with education&#x27;s inflexibility, advocating for documents that help learners navigate the &quot;learning world&quot; independently. Reflects his belief that education should accommodate diverse learner needs.</div>

<p><b>Travel documents for the independent learner</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>	</p>
<p>We are a family of travelers.<span><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span></span>As I write this, I am preparing for a trip to South East Asia.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I’m meeting my daughter in Bali and we will back-pack for a week or so on the Island of Java.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My son has just returned from a week of hiking alone in the mountains of Colorado. My wife will travel to New Mexico to visit our son and his family.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We start from different locations, have different interests and expectations, bring different backgrounds and use different modes of transportation.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My son was an independent travel3er for the entire eight days; the rest of us are involved in some group travel, some independent travel, and some independent travel but in a group setting.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>In preparation for my trip, I have been pouring over maps, airline schedules, land transportation schedules, insurance coverage, visa requirements, currency regulations, travel guides, the Internet, etc.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>most of the information so far I have gathered myself although I am now consulting my travel agent.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She has access to more, different and, in some cases but certainly not all, better information which she can use to help me plan and execute my journey.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I’m about ready now to make some binding commitments, lay down my hard earned cash and begin reading in detail about my anticipated new adventures.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>While my travel objectives have never been to obtain recognition or certification, on occasion my travel experiences have been recognized.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Certificates have been awarded but not by my travel agent.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My passport certifies me to be a Canadian; visas have been require to enter some countries but increasingly this barrier is coming down; my health record, more of a transcript than a certificate, has never been shown.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I have certificates to show that I have crossed the equator, “kissed the cod”, spent more than 48 hours as a tourist in one province; and there are others.</p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Parallel in education</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>There is a parallel with education; it is often referred to as a journey.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And learners, parents and taxpayers certainly lay down great amounts of hard earned cash in support of our individual and collective educational journeys.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>As learners, we start from different points, travel in a variety of ways, have differing interests and expectations, have differing amounts of time available for the journey, and have differing degrees of interest, energy and capability to travel independently.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The travel industry can handle both group and independent travelers; the education industry, in spite of the rhetoric, cannot.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In education, most of the travel literature is designed for the “travel” advisor.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The one exception is the availability of information about places in interest.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>All learners, but especially independent learners, could benefit from more, better and different travel documents.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Here are the first ones I would prepare.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This is not a complete list; the possibilities are many.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b><i>An atlas which would provide learners with a quick visual overview of the learning world,</i></b></p>
<p><b><i></i></b><br></p>
<p><b><i>Curriculum maps to show learners the scope of the curriculum, how the curriculum is structured and how various subjects are related,</i></b></p>
<p><b><i></i></b><br></p>
<p><b><i>Learning models which show learners a variety of paths which they may follow in order to meet their educational objectives,</i></b></p>
<p><b><i></i></b><br></p>
<p><b><i>Learning management models which<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>professionals the various intervention points and the variety of roles required to support independent learners,</i></b></p>
<p><b><i></i></b><br></p>
<p><b><i>Learning guides to explain in some detail what is involved in reaching specific outcomes and how a learner can assess his level of achievement,</i></b></p>
<p><b><i></i></b><br></p>
<p><b><i>Learning plans or contracts between a teacher and a learner to assist both in the management of the learning activity.</i></b></p>
<p><b><i></i></b><br></p>
<p>Most, but not all, of these travel documents can be found in some of the more innovative schools.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Others would like to introduce them.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Many teachers would like to know how to prepare these travel documents.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Learners could profit from them.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In-service teacher education is the place to start.</p>
