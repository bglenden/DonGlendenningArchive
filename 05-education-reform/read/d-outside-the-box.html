  D-Outside the box 
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Don expresses cautious skepticism about education improvement prospects in PEI, noting &quot;new people bring new ideas but I&#x27;ve not picked up any buzz yet&quot; and observing that &quot;educators are still thinking within the box.&quot; He discusses charter schools (Alberta model) as a possibility but questions whether adding charters truly improves systems. He then presents more radical alternatives: disconnect specific schools from system control, grant them autonomous trustee boards with staffing autonomy, and operate them as pilot projects (suggesting Murray River and Alberton to remove bureaucratic influence). Don also proposes siphoning resources to Summerside&#x27;s learning center and opening one school summers for remedial support. The letter reveals both his skepticism about genuine reform willingness and his creativity in proposing concrete alternative structures.</div>

<p>Editor,</p>

<p>Charlottetown, PEI	</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Dear Sir:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><b>Are we making progress?</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>I had coffee with a friend a few days ago and he asked if I thought that education on PEI was improving; my answer was a” definite maybe”.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>New people bring new ideas but I’ve not picked up any buzz yet.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Educators are still thinking within the box.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>We talked about charter schools, at least the Alberta model; that’s always a possibility.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I know that some people are interested; charter schools are good but I’m not sure that adding a charter school does much to improve the system.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>There were a couple of other items that have potential.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>One was to disconnect a couple of schools from the system, give them their own “trustees” and autonomy to staff as they see fit, and sun them as pilot projects.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My friend thought that they should be put in Murray River and Alberton to remove them from the influence of the education bureaucracy.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I suggested that a bit of money be siphoned off to support the new learning centre in Summerside. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And we should be planning now for next summer, perhaps something as simple as one school open for people who want help.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Hope springs eternal, but don’t hold your breath.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
