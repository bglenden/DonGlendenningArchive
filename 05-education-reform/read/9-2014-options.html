<div class="reader-summary">Don critiques a school&#x27;s decision to place a struggling math student in a lower-level course rather than providing extra instruction. He frames schools as places that should &quot;open doors, create opportunities, and help each child find a meaningful place in society.&quot; By transferring the student to a lower level, the school created a barrier rather than supporting access. This choice delays postsecondary entry, reduces college/university likelihood, diminishes employment prospects, and contradicts education&#x27;s stated goal of helping students develop to full capacity.</div>

<p>Dear Sir:</p>
<p>Options</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The role of a school is to open doors, to create opportunities, to help each child find a “meaningful place in society”; schools that do this to a high degree are sometimes called schools of opportunity.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The impact on students of “choices” made by schools came to my attention a few weeks ago; there may be things that I<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>do not know about this case , but here’s my unswestanding</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>A high school student, with hopes, even plans to go to college or university, was having difficulty with math; that’s not unusual; I am told that struggling with math is not uncommon. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Assuming the school wants to do the best for the child, what are a school’s options?</p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li1">Let the a student struggle and continue to fall behind<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li1">Suggest an upgrading course after graduation</li>
  <li class="li1">Provide extra instruction</li>
  <li class="li1">Transfer the student a lower level course</li>
  <li class="li1">Recommend private tutoring</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p>Options three and five keep doors open and create opportunities, however, the cost of private tutoring is out of reach for many parents and providing extra time on task seems foreign to school thinking. So the school recommended/chose option four.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The student is now in a lower-level math class. In effect, the school created a detour, no a barrier, in his path to education.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>At best, this option delays entrance to postsecondary studies, reduces the likelihood of that student going to college or university, reduces the chance of a smooth transition to employment and<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>likely means a significant reduction in lifetime income; at worst, it may divert him from being the citizen he is capable of being, the citizen we want him to be.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Education documents tell us education, and presumably schooling, is intended to help students to develop to their fullest capacities.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The option chosen for this student fails to fulfil that goal. Personally, I am more concerned by cases of this kind than by low PISA and PCAP scores.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
