  1  Chief Supt
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Inspired by a presentation by Dr. Heather Morrison, Chief Health Officer for PEI, Don proposes establishing a Chief Education Officer position focused solely on improving education quality. He notes historical precedent: New Brunswick&#x27;s Department of Education once had separate Deputy Minister (administration) and Chief Superintendent (programming) roles; PEI had a Chief Superintendent until at least 1930. He recommends &quot;Director&quot; over &quot;Superintendent&quot; to reflect education&#x27;s breadth beyond schools, aligning with modern educational scope.</div>

<p>Editor,</p>
<p>	</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Dear Sir:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><b>PEI needs a chief education officer</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>As I write, I am reflecting on a presentation earlier today by Dr. Heather Morrison, Chief Health Officer for Prince Edward Island. Not surprising, the presentation on Island health matters was both interesting and informative.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>While listening, my mind wandered back to my early teaching days in New Brunswick when the Department of Education had both a Deputy Minister and a Chief Superintendent; the Deputy Minister, as I recall, handled administrative matters and the Chief Superintended dealt with programming.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>PEI, and perhaps other Provinces, had a Chief Superintendent as well at least up to 1930.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Given the current concerns about education, it may be time to establish a new senior position that of Chief Education Officer whose sole role would be to improve the quality of education in PEI.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I suggest the Director rather than Superintendent in recognition of the fact that so much of our education occurs outside our school system.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>	</p>
<p>Don Glendenning</p>
<p>A long-time student of education</p>
