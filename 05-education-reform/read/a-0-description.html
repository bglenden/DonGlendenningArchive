<div class="reader-summary">Foundational description document outlining eight major concerns about PEI&#x27;s education system. Don identifies a core conflict of interest: teachers set standards, measure achievement, and determine student levels—contrary to practice in most industries. He highlights issues including grade inflation, social promotion, confusion between age-based grouping and achievement levels, and erosion of public confidence. The document contrasts PEI&#x27;s approach with international models (apprenticeship, language authorities, IB programs) and articulates why current proficiency level systems are fundamentally flawed due to uncertain outcome origins and lack of external criteria.</div>

<p><b>Achievement levels in education</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Public has major concerns about the quality of its education system</p>
<p>lssues/Con€e.ns lnclude</p>
<p>1. Standards fo. most products and services are established by or in consultation with users or the government acting on</p>
<p>their behalf; not so in the public education system where those who teach, not only set the standards but measure</p>
<p>and determine the level reached by students served. ln the views of the writer this not only constitutes a conflict of</p>
<p>interest but casts doubt on the quallty ofthe product.</p>

<p>the US, Labour mobility, impact of technology instruction and assessment, the perceived erosion of public school</p>

<p>Perception that our economy is sufferlng because of either the lack of skilled workers or their education levels,</p>
<p>Education system changes - levels are less clear grade inflation, social promotion, report cards Confusion over the issue</p>
<p>of school standards is further confused, some would say exacerbated, by the practice of using grade level to mean "a</p>

<p>PEI practice:</p>
<p>Views on current system of recognizing student achievement at the public school levet:</p>
