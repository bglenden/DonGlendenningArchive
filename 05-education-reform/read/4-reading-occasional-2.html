  4 Reading Occasional-2
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Dated April 20, 2013, Education 20/20 Inc. document exploring reading from learning perspective. Don defines education&#x27;s purpose as developing individual potential and preparing for life roles (individual, family member, learner, citizen, producer, consumer). He emphasizes reading as foundational, enabling access to life&#x27;s challenges and treasures. Documents widespread concern about reading through Islander discussions, noting it&#x27;s a community problem unsolvable by schools alone. The paper provides multiple reading definitions emphasizing meaning-making, independence, comprehension, fluency, and mental text engagement. Includes extensive statistics on literacy challenges: 40 percent of Islanders lack adequate literacy/numeracy for high school completion, PEI students rank below national average internationally, 30 percent of Islanders cannot deal with common printed materials. Details Atlantic Canada Grade 12 English Language Arts curriculum expectations for reading and viewing, including text selection, diverse literature experience, comprehension strategies, evaluation skills, and critical response. Proposes reading level frameworks and discusses strategies (scanning, skimming, underlining, highlighting, summarizing) with resources for learner support.</div>

<b>Learning
to Read</b></p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-left: 0.5in; font-weight: normal; text-indent: -0.5in">
NOTE:	This
paper was pulled together to provide background information for a
discussion on reading.  The document is based on the view that
improving learning levels should start with a clear understanding of
the nature of reading and the process of learning to read.</p>
<p lang="en-US" style="margin-left: 0.5in; font-weight: normal; text-indent: -0.5in">
<br />

</p>
<p lang="en-US" style="font-weight: normal"><br />

</p>
<p lang="en-US" style="font-weight: normal">Our
futures, as individuals and as a community, depend, to a large
degree, on the nature and level of education available to, and
actually attained by, our citizens.  Education helps us to develop
our individual potential to the fullest and prepares us for our many
life roles (Oregon Education Act-1990) that
of an individual, family member, learner, citizen, producer and
consumer.  Educating ourselves requires engaging in a variety of
activities with a view to assembling a range of skills, knowledge and
attitudes supportive of functioning in the various life roles for the
remainder of our lives.   Based on this thinking, the quality of
one’s education would be measured by how well one is able to
function in the various life roles.  
</p>
<p lang="en-US" style="font-weight: normal"><br />

</p>
<p lang="en-US" style="font-weight: normal">One’s
education is the result of everything that we learn in our lifetime
that has had a formative effect on us.  It starts at birth with some
of our most important learning occurring in the first few year of
life; skills learned at that time, to a large degree, determine what
we become in later life.  Learning is a partnership and nowhere is
that partnership more important than in helping every citizen learn
to read well. Reading
is the one skill that undergirds and even unlocks life’s challenges
and treasures.   
</p>
<p lang="en-US" style="font-weight: normal"><br />

</p>
<p lang="en-US" style="font-weight: normal">Concern
about reading is widespread.  During the past few months I’ve
talked about education with Islanders, teachers, retired teachers and
the public at large, from Souris to Alberton and, invariably, they
expressed concern about reading.  And literacy is a frequent subject
in our local media whether it be the Raise A Reader initiative, the
work of the PEI literacy Alliance, initiatives by the Atlantic
Ministers of Education, or the need for skilled workers.  Reading
is a community problem; it cannot be solved by schools alone. While
informal reports suggest that reading levels in schools are
improving, much remains to be done.  Raising
the reading levels of our citizens is a major undertaking and one
worthy of our support.  
</p>
<p lang="en-US" style="font-weight: normal"><br />

</p>
<p lang="en-US" style="font-weight: normal">When
one learns, one changes behaviour; in simple terms, learning results
in a change in attitude, skill and knowledge and often a combination
of the three.  We recognize that learning to read, and learning to
read better, occurs in the context of learning to communicate
generally and includes learning to listen, to write and to speak.  We
also believe, however, that it is important to understand each
component separately, and have limited this paper to an examination
of reading from a learner’s perspective.

<p lang="en-US" style="font-weight: normal"> <b>What
do readers do?</b></p>
<p lang="en-US" style="font-weight: normal"><br />

</p>
<p lang="en-US" style="font-weight: normal">Based
on the view that reading ability reflects what one can do and how
well one can do it, I searched for and found a number of lists of
reading outcomes, competencies, skills or expectations; none were as
complete or comprehensive as  I had hoped.  The Atlantic Provinces
cooperate on curriculum and the website for the Department of
Education and early Childhood Development publishes curriculum guides
for all high school subjects.  I am not sure which guide best suits
our purposes but, on the assumption that reading competencies or
skills at the PEI Grade 12 level and those of adults would be roughly
the same, I opted to include in this paper the reading and viewing
component of the Language Arts graduation expectations.  (Readers are
also encouraged to visit the PEI Department of Education website).
