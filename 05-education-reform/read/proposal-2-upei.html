<p><b>Education 2020 Numeracy Award Application</b></p>
<p><b>A Proposal to Improve Data Literacy in Prince Edward Island Students</b></p>
<p><b>Submitted by the Outreach Committee of the School of Mathematical and Computational</b></p>
<p><b>Sciences (SMCS), University of Prince Edward Island</b></p>
<p><b>Contact: Dr. Shannon Fitzpatrick, Associate Dean, SMCS, sfitzpatrick@upei.ca,</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>ISSUE</b></p>
<p>Digital literacy has become an important issue for a number of reasons:</p>
<p>• Personal data is being collected at unprecedented rates. It is important for all of us to</p>
<p>understanding how data is stored and used.</p>
<p>• Data is used to advocate for change, inform policy and justify decisions. Many of us do</p>
<p>not have the tools required to understand and question the data that is presented to us.</p>
<p>• In business and industry, quantitative models have become a vital part of decision</p>
<p>making, and the need for skilled employees is ever increasing. The ability to work with</p>
<p>and analyze data is becoming a vital skill in our knowledge-economy.</p>
<p>As the amount of data being created and collected explodes, improving data literacy in all young</p>
<p>Canadians has become increasingly important.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>Data literacy is the ability to collect, interpret, analyze and use data in a critical manner.</p>
<p>However, we should not view data literacy as being distinct from numeracy and other</p>
<p>mathematical skills - all require the same problem-solving and critical thinking skills. By</p>
<p>developing educational tools that are built around data analysis, we expand students’ numeracy</p>
<p>skills through concrete examples that inform students about the world around them.</p>
<p>A key tool in increasing data literacy is inquiry-based learning. Inquiry-based learning, which</p>
<p>has gained significant popularity in recent years, encourages students to take an active role in</p>
<p>the design and implementation of their own experiments. Many studies support the</p>
<p>effectiveness of such an approach. [1]</p>
<p>While inquiry-based learning may be typically associated with science education, this approach</p>
<p>can also be applied to mathematics education. The PPDAC approach (Problem, Plan, Data</p>
<p>Collection, Analysis and Conclusion) [2] applies the inquiry-based model to statistical analysis.</p>
<p>Where the PPDAC approach differs from typical inquiry-based model is that the traditional route</p>
<p>of posing a question, collecting data and a drawing conclusion is not always followed. With</p>
<p>PPDAC, students can begin with an existing data set and, by analyzing the data, decide what</p>
<p>relevant questions can be answered.</p>
<p>Along with learning basic statistical concepts and principles, student would participate in</p>
<p>• Collection of data</p>
<p>• Selection of data (querying existing data sets)</p>
<p>• Creation of data visualizations</p>
<p>Of course, when dealing with large data sets, the use of technology also plays a significant role.</p>
<p>One example of how statistical reasoning has been brought into the classroom is the Census at</p>
<p>School project (censusatschool.ca). Through various surveys and activities, students can not</p>
<p>only collect and analyze data from their own class, but examine data collected both nationally</p>
<p>and internationally. Learning activities are available for grades 4 through 12.</p>
<p>Another example is the approach outlined in [3], where researchers created lesson plans based</p>
<p>on large data sets related to solar energy generation and use in the UK. In this study, a group</p>
<p>of 10-11 year-olds were presented with visualizations of the data and tasked with answering a</p>
<p>number of questions. (In the PPDAC model, students were starting with the conclusion.) It was</p>
<p>found that “students demonstrated that they were able to make valid interpretations and tell nice</p>
<p>stories from the relatively sparse information given in visualizations”.</p>
<p>While data literacy can be obviously integrated into traditional mathematics and science</p>
<p>education, we should not ignore the need for data literacy in the arts. Data can be used to</p>
<p>engage people and encourage change; data can be used to create a narrative. Some examples</p>
<p>of data-driven arts projects can be found datatoolkit.org,uk. Data Toolkit encourages arts</p>
<p>organizations to combine art and data to examine social issues, and provides the framework for</p>
<p>creating such projects.</p>
<p>GOALS</p>
<p>We are interested in providing tools for teachers that will encourage them to integrate data</p>
<p>inquiry into their curriculum. In particular, our goal is to provide teachers with concrete learning</p>
<p>activities that can be used in conjunction with Census at School to teach specific components of</p>
<p>the PEI curriculum. We will hire two undergraduate students to collect, organize, and update</p>
<p>existing Statistics learning activities for use with Census at School in Mathematics classrooms</p>
<p>on Prince Edward Island. These students will identify specific numeracy components of the PEI</p>
<p>curriculum at each grade level that are well suited for Census at School projects, and they will</p>
<p>provide teachers with collections of self-contained learning activities that will explicitly address</p>
<p>each curriculum goal.</p>
<p>Specific outcomes for the project are:</p>
<p>1. To complete a survey of available materials, identify the best materials for each grade level,</p>
<p>and indicate how they align to PEI Curriculum outcomes.</p>
<p>2. Update and modify available materials to work within the Census at School framework and</p>
<p>the newly-created Canadian Census at School R Shiny interactive web apps.</p>
<p>3. Create an online repository of the best resources related data literacy.</p>
<p>4. Create a brochure to be distributed to schools that provides teachers with a quick reference</p>
<p>for locating data-driven activities.</p>
<p>5. To develop activities that use the PPDAC approach to learning, utilizing data sets that are</p>
<p>relevant to island students.</p>
<p>Such activities could be used by teachers, or become part of a data literacy outreach initiative.</p>
<p>Once resources are developed, the Outreach Committee of the School of Mathematical and</p>
<p>Computational Sciences will offer training to teachers and other educators on the available</p>
<p>materials.</p>
<p>LOCATION, DATES, and PERSONNEL</p>
<p>This is part of an ongoing initiative of the Outreach Committee at UPEI’s School of Mathematical</p>
<p>and Computational Sciences. The committee consists of Dr. Michael MacIsaac (Statistics), Dr.</p>
<p>Christopher Power (Computer Science), Dr. David LeBlanc (Computer Science) and Dr.</p>
<p>Shannon Fitzpatrick (Mathematics).</p>
<p>Two undergraduate students will be hired for a 14-week period between May and August, 2020</p>
<p>to contribute to this project. These students will be mentored by Outreach Committee members.</p>
<p>Funding from the Education 2020 Numeracy Award would be put toward student salaries.</p>
<p>The rate of pay at UPEI for students with specialized skills is $15.75 per hour. Based on a 35-</p>
<p>hour work week, the total cost of personnel is $15,435. We have applied for funding from the</p>
<p>Canada Summer Jobs Program, which would contribute approximately $6,000. Remaining</p>
<p>funds would come from a gift to the School of Mathematical and Computational Sciences from</p>
<p>TD Bank.</p>
