  2011-11 Graduate
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Don addresses complaints from parents about graduates&#x27; reading levels, noting both positive improvements in elementary instruction and concerns about overall performance. He examines how reading ability is measured (fluency, range, comprehension, independence, speed, vocabulary) and notes the lack of clear standards for high school graduates. Don proposes a simple standard: &quot;In order to obtain a high school graduation diploma, a person must demonstrate the ability to read a range of printed materials with independence, fluency and ease.&quot; He argues such clarity would improve stakeholder communication and invites suggestions for better articulations.</div>

<p>Dear Editor:</p>
<p><b>How Well Should a Graduate be Able to Read?</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>Over the past few months, people have engaged me in conversations (it isn't hard to do) about reading.</p>
<p>Parents, and grandparents, wonder why they should have to pay the cost of private tutoring; most,</p>
<p>however, complain about the low level of reading of recent graduates. ln fairness, I also hear positive</p>
<p>comments about improvements in reading instruction at the elementary level.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>While reading is not my specialty, I browsed some literature and the internet to see how reading is</p>
<p>measured. I did not find a simple description but did find that the ability to read is usually described in</p>
<p>terms of fluency, range of material, comprehension, independence, speed, vocabulary and flow. What I</p>
<p>was really looking for was a simple statement to describe the level of reading expected of a high school</p>
<p>graduate. I didn't find one, however, so I created the following:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>ln order to obtain o high school graduation diploma, a person must demonstrate the ability to</p>
<p>read range of printed materials with independence, fluency and ease</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Having such a description would, I believe, clarify both expectations and communication among</p>
<p>stakeholders. I am sure that there are better descriptions and would welcome yours at</p>
<p>standards2020@gmail.com</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
