  2013-07-07 School Credits
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">A complex, lengthy piece arguing that schools conflate teaching and sorting functions, which creates inherent conflicts. Don distinguishes between testing as a teaching tool (confidential, diagnostic) versus testing for administrative control and credentialing. He proposes separating these functions: schools should teach while external qualification authorities (like a proposed Atlantic Qualification Authority) handle certification and sorting. He critiques the control exercised by the Department of Education over scheduling, curriculum, and staffing as incompatible with teaching responsibility.</div>

<p>Dear Sir:</p>
<p><b>Challenge for Credit</b></p>
<p>Schools, colleges and universities are teaching institutions; people go there to get help with learning.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Teachers test students to inform teaching, that is, to help both the learner and teacher to plan further study. Test result are, or should be confidential and only be shared by or with the consent of the student.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I take this stand for a couple of reasons.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>First of all, grades are simply an administrative convenience, some might even say a means of exercising control.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I am aware from personal experience, and from conversations with teachers, of the range of levels on any subject in a given grade.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I also believe that all, or most all, students could successfully finish high school if given a bit more instruction.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The fact that they do not, is mostly the fault of an inflexible system.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>, that is the inability of the system to schedule additional help.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>To withdraw support when a<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>student is time or to find Getting an education is not a competition, how well a student performed, how long it took It is not, and should not be, the role of a school, or a teacher, to award diplomas, degrees or prizes.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Sorting students based on tests designed to help teachers is not, at least in my view, part of the educational process; in fact the very idea of using test results for anything other than helping a learner is in conflict with the idea of teaching.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Let me hurry to say that I am not against sorting, diplomas or degrees, or prizes, but that function should not be performed by the person paid to teach me.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The same applies to college or universities. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>If we need a public sorting agency, and we probably do, we should set one up outside of our teaching institutions, and give it a clear mandate.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Because of the likely focus on qualifications, and their importance to employers, perhaps the sorting function should be assigned to Chambers of Commerce, or better still, establish a purpose driven organization, The Atlantic Qualification Authority.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>is a testinI’m not sure that schools should also be running a public sorting business.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I find the two roles, teaching<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>and sorting, to be in conflict.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That conflict carries over to exams.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I think of exams<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>as a way of determining what one has learned so far and a measure to be used in deciding what, when and how to teach tomorrow.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>I Not only do schools teach, they also sort. The Department of Education certainly exert a lot of influence and control over our early years. We are required to attend a school of its choosing, at days and times it sets, study prescribed courses, must leave school when told whether you’ve finished or not, hire the teachers, issue the transcripts and diplomas, act as though they own<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>the buildings.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Not a very good way to teach responsibility, entrepreneurship or good work habits.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>There is a growing recognition, however, that schools cannot be, and should not try to be, all things to all people; one’s education is much broader than one’s schooling. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Some post secondary institutions and employers are beginning to look beyond schools transcripts and diplomas to a broader range of skills as part of their selection process. Nova Scotia Department of Education offers credit for some student activities outside school including Junior Achievement, arts, music and perhaps cadet programs.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Credentials no longer capture this concept of education.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>It’s time to rethink education, the role of schools, and how we report achievement.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Perhaps it’s time for a “passport to learning” that would report on a broader range of educational experiences.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>And, if you want to share your ideas with me, you may do so at standards2020@gmail.com. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
