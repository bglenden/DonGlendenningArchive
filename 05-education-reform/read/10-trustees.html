<div class="reader-summary">December 2019 letter to The Guardian signed by Don Glendenning reflecting on school board re-establishment in PEI. References Patrick Watson&#x27;s &#x27;The Day the Schools Disappeared&#x27; and advocates for autonomy, accountability, and rethinking education beyond institutional schooling models—consistent with Don&#x27;s lifelong education reform philosophy.</div>

<p>I was delighted to read that plans are afoot to re-establish community based school boards; the political benefits are obvious; the likely improvements to education are less clear and will be determined by what Boards are mandated and allowed to do.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The OECD, which gave us PISA assessments, tells us that PISA results are better when schools have autonomy and accountability for their day to day operation.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>So, if improvement is the reason for establishing school boards, not only should we delegate to School Boards, we should also delegate much of the day to day operation of schools to schools themselves.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>While I generally agree, such a move by itself is unlikely to improve the quality of public education.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Some 50 years ago, I sat on the top step in the Confederation Centre theatre during a PEI Teachers’ convention and listened to Patrick Watson describe what happened “The Day the Schools Disappeared”. Fifty years later, my mind is still stirred by the possibilities.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Watson led his audience through a series of reactions and events of citizens as they grappled<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>with events and set<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>course of action.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We, like Watson, should revisit the question; unfortunately, however, I was unable to secure a copy a copy of Watson’s text.</p>

<p>Education in Prince Edward Island could benefit from some structural changes.T</p>

<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Education is messy, institutions are not enough; squeezing education into schools distorts education services and may be likened to delivering all health services through hospitals.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Communities suffer. It’s time, even past time, to rethink our practises.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Given all the changes in the world we inhabit, it’s time to revisit the subject.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Doing, may reveal new roles, even for trustees</p>
