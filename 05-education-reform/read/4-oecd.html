  4-OECD
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Responding to OECD education assessment results, Glendenning advocates not increasing class sizes or changing teacher requirements, but instead clarifying outcome expectations, defining performance levels, distributing standards to all stakeholders, developing aligned materials and teaching strategies, and providing frequent progress reports. He emphasizes that clear, measurable, learner-understood expectations should precede structural changes. His recommendations prioritize clarity and alignment over resource increases, reflecting his philosophy that systemic coherence matters as much as spending levels.</div>

<p>Charlottetown, PEI</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Dear Editor:</p>
<p>OECD Report</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>While we should not over-react to the results of the recent OECD report on education, neither should</p>
<p>we ignore them.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The most likely response from the education community will be to reduce the student-teacher ratio,</p>
<p>increase the length of the teacher education program, change the requirements for teachers entering</p>
<p>the profession, lengthen the school day or revamp the curriculum.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>All of the above may be required. From my quick review of PEI school program guidelines, however, let</p>
<p>me suggest a different first response, namely:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>1' A clearer statement of expectations for each assessment period - the end of Grades 3, 5, 9 and</p>
<p>12. Outcomes should be clear and measurable and stated in a way the learner understands.</p>
<p>2 A clear definition of each performance level. Whether the scale is a number or letter, each</p>
<p>level should be defined. ln other words, what does an A, B or other rating level really mean</p>
<p>in terms of performance?</p>
<p>3 Providing written copies of each standard for each subject and each grade level to teachers,</p>
<p>learners, test makers, employers and parents. lt is important that all stakeholders work from</p>
<p>the same set of expectations.</p>
<p>4 Developing teaching materials and strategies in support of each outcome.</p>
<p>5 Providing learners with regular reports on progress towards meeting the standard. A redesign</p>
<p>of report cards will likely be needed.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>As to the review process, who is responsible for setting standards, anyway? Who should be consulted?</p>
<p>How do we ensure that standards are relevant to the life outside school? And how do we know?</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The problem of unclear expectations is not unique to PEI nor to the school system, however, the OECD</p>
<p>results give urgency to addressing the issue.</p>
<p><br></p>

<p><br></p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
<p><br></p>
