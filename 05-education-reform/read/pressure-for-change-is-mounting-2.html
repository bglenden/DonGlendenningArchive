  Pressure for change is mounting 2
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Don Glendenning penned a letter to the Charlottetown Guardian editor in March 2014 advocating for educational system reform. He identifies mounting pressure for change across multiple dimensions: changing marketplace demands emphasizing developmental over content-driven models, escalating costs of schooling, quality concerns requiring remedial courses at Holland College and UPEI, technology underutilization in schools, professional desires for teacher autonomy, and political domain removal from education. Glendenning notes that while officials may address these issues privately, public awareness and involvement remain essential for meaningful reform.</div>

<p>Dear Sir:</p>
<p><b>Pressure for change is mounting</b></p>
<p>Although I’ve not tallied the column inches of recent media coverage, the pressure for change in our school systems appears to be mounting; included in the calls for change is a growing recognition that many of the blockages to change are structural and not professional.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Parents are looking for a developmental model but schools are organized to deliver predetermined content; the latter takes a different model from the former.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Pressure for change arises from:</p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li1">changing market place: increased support for social and emotional development, help in obtaining qualifications not just credentials, increasing availability and quality of on line courses and the ability to customize content.</li>
</ul>
<p>2	The cost of schooling is coming under increasing scrutiny:<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>schools have not been able to use the new technology to contain costs; what’s a fair portion of a Provincial budget to allocate to schools?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>3	Quality:<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>increased concern about the level of basic skills and the need for Holland College and UPEI to run courses for work already taken in high school.</p>
<p>3	Technology:<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>schools have been unable to take advantage of emerging technology either to improve the product, produce product in shorter time</p>
<p>5	Professionalism – teachers want more control over what they do, when, where, and how and, I believe are quite prepared to take responsibility for theor actions.</p>
<p>6	Politics: the public believes that education should be removed from the political domain.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>While it is likely that these matters are being addressed by our educational officials, the public does not know that and, in fact, the public expects to be involved in the change process.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
<p><br></p>
