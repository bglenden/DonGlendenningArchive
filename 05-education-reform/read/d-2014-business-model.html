  D 2014 Business model
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Dated March 12, 2013, this comprehensive letter argues that current school models are unsustainable due to cost escalation (rising 90% in five years), quality decline, inflexibility, technological limitations, and public dissatisfaction. Don applies business model frameworks (value, resources, processes, revenue) to education, identifying that while PEI has strengthened resources and revenue, values and delivery processes remain outdated. He contends schools must shift from content delivery to learner development and explores whether current institutional structures can support needed transformation. The letter exemplifies his analytical rigor and belief that education requires systemic innovation.</div>

<p>Editor, The Guardian</p>
<p>Charlottetown, PEI</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Dear Sir:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Pressure for change is mounting</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>Although I’ve not tallied the column inches of recent media coverage, the pressure for change in our school systems appears to be mounting; included in the calls for change is a growing recognition that the many of the blockages to change are structural and not professional.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>More professional development, another million dollars worth of computers, a different approach to teaching will not in themselves make much difference. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>At the moment, schools are organized to deliver predetermined content over extended periods of time to a captive market; that model won’t survive for the following reasons:</p>
<p><br></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li5">The market place is changing, increasing emphasis on development, outcomes other than knowledgeand the need for qualifications instead of credentials</li>
  <li class="li5">Knowledge once available through teachers is now available through technology</li>
</ul>
<p>2	The cost of schooling is coming under increasing scrutiny-<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>$11,000 per student per year, rapid indraws attention of the public and economistsper year, economist; cost per unit has risen 90 5 in past five years; will bankrupt us</p>
<p>2	Quality – stable or declining, special concern for decline of basic skills, inflexible, declining need for knowledge based programming</p>
<p>3	4	Advent of technology – unable to take advantage of emerging technology either to improve the product, produce product in shortet time, customize product, put knowledge at a learners fingertips</p>
<p>5	Growth of professionalism – teachers want more control over what they do, when, where, how, etc</p>
<p>6	Public is getting fed up with the politics of education</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li5">Much of this can now be delivered with the aid of technology <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p>Education is a developmental process; Increasing call for teachers to h</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Wont survive<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b>Cost:</b> Overhead costs are swamping the system; Current model cannot be sustained – will bankrupt us</p>
<p>Market place is changing</p>
<p>Quality decliningCannot afford the current model</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Relatively routine educational tasks are being delivered by over qualified staff</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Reward to teachers: </b>System lacks highly qualified staff to deal with more challenging cases</p>
<p>Different business models may be required</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Unloikely that the current model can be rejigged</p>
<p>Universities ae not yet producing teachers for the emerging model</p>
<p>Model wont survive</p>
<p>The <b>educational market place is changing</b>, costs have skyrocketed, quality has<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>not improved and in fact, some would argue it has declined. The cost disease (AIMS 0 has struck, bureaucracy has grown,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>without an earket Several times recently mention has been made of the structuralAIMS the costs disease</p>
<p>Schools need a different business model.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Switch from content delivery to development</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>Schools, colleges are businesses; they have a mission, to provide instruction to students, resources in the form of people and building; has established criteria and procedures for delivering its services, and while it does not make a profit, it certainly has revenue. Let me hasten to add that I am not suggesting that the public achools be run by business nor that the purpose of schools is primarily to prepare students for employment.</p>

<p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>esses.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I beg to differ.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>While business is not my field of study, I am of the view that public sector organizations, including schools, colleges and universities are businesses and, in fact, have, or should have,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>business plans which are updated from time to time.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>According to Forbes, there are four components of business models in the sector:</p>
<p><b>- Value - </b>what is offered to individuals<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>or the community</p>
<p><b>- Resources – </b>that an organization assembles</p>
<p><span class="Apple-converted-space">          </span>to provide that service</p>
<p><b>- Processes – </b>that the organization goes through</p>
<p><span class="Apple-converted-space">                        </span>to deliver its services, and</p>
<p><b>- Revenue - </b>gathered in support of its work.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Of the four, I believe that the first and third, what is offered and the manner in which it is delivered is out of synch with the times.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>II say this because out province, and most provinves have made great strides in gathering quality resources and in providing revenue; values and processes are relatively unchanged<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Gains have not been commensurate with the increases. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
