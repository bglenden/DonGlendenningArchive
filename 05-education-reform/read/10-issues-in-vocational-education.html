  10 Issues in vocational education
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">A comprehensive analysis identifying twelve critical issues in secondary vocational education: definition, image, versus general education, graduation requirements, articulation, curriculum, staffing, teacher certification, facilities, counseling, administration, and employment. Don criticizes academia&#x27;s bias and the degradation of vocational education&#x27;s image through renaming (technical, applied). He questions why fewer vocational educators occupy leadership roles and why comprehensive schools have lost vocational administrators. He notes the declining labor-intensive job sector requiring corresponding curriculum shifts toward service-sector roles. This article synthesizes decades of Don&#x27;s practical experience with competency-based and vocational education.</div>

<p><b>Issues in vocational education</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Introduction</b></p>
<p>Secondary vocational education is in a state of flux and many educators, academic and vocational, are concerned about its survival and, even more important, the negative impact its demise would have on the education of our young people.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Secondary education ahs a strong bias towards university preparation even though a relatively small percentage of students who enter school pursue that objective.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The recent trend across the country to increase the number of academic courses required for high school graduation reflects this view but appears to have little support in either research or logic.</p>
<p>Within this context, vocational secondary education itself is undergoing considerable change including a movement towards more generic courses, exploration rather than occupational specific training, and less streaming.</p>
<p>Against this background, the following are identified as some of the critical issues in secondary vocational education.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Issue 1 ─ Definition</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Vocational education has traditionally been defined as that part of one’s education intended to help one choose an occupation, prepare to enter income-generating employment, hold employment, keep abreast of change in a specialty, secure promotion, or to change occupations. Is this an appropriate definition for the 21<sup>st</sup> century?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>What is the relationship between vocational education and technical, adult, or continuing education?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If vocational is defined as a level, what are the criteria used to determine levels?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>What is the role of “vocational educators” in defining vocational education?</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Issue 2 ─ Image</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The image of vocational education appears to have deteriorated and “vocational” is frequently replaced by such terms as technical, technological, applied education, etc.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Some people view vocational education as narrow and academic education as broad.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Some still define education as a level rather than a focus; other people believe that there should be a number of levels within any vocational subject in the same way that there are levels in academic subjects.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Should vocational courses be offered in secondary schools, and if so, what should be done to improve their image?</p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Issue 3 ─ Vocational versus General Education</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>There is a wide agreement that everyone needs a good general education.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Frequently this is interpreted as including ability to communicate, good human relations skills, ability to solve problems, to be a contributing member of a community and exhibiting responsible behavior.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>These can be taught using vocational subjects as a vehicle.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Why do we continue to emphasize academic subjects when there is little or no evidence that they are the best vehicle for general education, especially when the academic offerings are restricted to a narrower career path?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In the view of some writers, vocational subjects are excellent vehicles for teaching general education.</p>
<p><b>Issue 4 ─ Graduation Requirements</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>In response to criticism of the public schools, the overall number of credits required for high school graduation has been increased.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As well, there has been an increase in the number of compulsory academic courses needed to meet secondary school graduation requirements.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>At the local level, schools frequently require a higher number of credits that the provincial graduation requirements.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The additional courses also tend to be from traditional academic offerings.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The outcome of all the above is decline in the number of students who elect vocational courses.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>One wonders about the logic of this.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Are the current graduation requirements appropriate for the next decade?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>What should the graduation requirements be?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Are the graduation requirements consistent with the purposes of secondary education?</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Issue 5 ─ Articulation</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Students who take vocational courses in secondary school often find that those courses are not accepted for entrance into college or university.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A sequence of courses in traditional trades, on the other hand, frequently leads to advanced standing in a designated trade.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Is there any evidence that one pattern or sequence of courses rather than another pattern provides better preparation for college or university?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Is it reasonable to expect advanced standing in a college or university program when it is frequently not granted for an apprenticeship program?</p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Issue 6 ─ Curriculum</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Are some new thrusts required in the secondary vocational curriculum?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>More pre-technical courses?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Increased co-op education?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Entrepreneurship?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Does the curriculum reflect the current and future needs of the nation?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>What are the implications for the curriculum of a move toward generic vocational courses in high school?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Should some pre-employment training be retained at the secondary level?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Who should participate in the development for vocational education courses?</p>
<p>Centers of excellence and quality assurance are key issues for vocational educators.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>What program characteristics will carry vocational education into the next century?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>What is the role of advisory committees?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Do we have clear and well-understood mission statements?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>What about instructional methodology ─ teacher-directed or self-directed?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>How are the programs being organized and managed?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Should secondary vocational programs be competency-based instead of time-based?</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Issue 7 ─ Staffing</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Staff for vocational programs traditionally are drawn from appropriate business and industry and are required to have journeyman status or equivalent in a single field.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>All instructional staff are required to have occupational experience.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Given the movement towards generic vocational education, are the traditional qualifications still valid?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>What qualifications are appropriate for secondary vocational instructors for the next decade?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>What are the implications for the preparation or training of vocational education teachers?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Are salaries and benefits of vocational teachers comparable with those in business and industry?</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Issue 8 ─ Teacher Certification</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The current certification system appears to favor academic teachers in that the requirement for a university degree works an extra hardship on vocational staff.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Vocational teachers are required to have significant business and industrial experience: academic teachers do not (perhaps this requirement should be added to the criteria for academic teachers also).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Why should vocational teachers alone carry this additional burden of preparation time?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A teacher of history can take a history course during the summer and increase both certification level and salary.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Why shouldn’t vocational teachers be treated the same way?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Should teacher certification be designed to encourage teachers to keep up to date in their field?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>What is the purpose of a certification system?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Do we have any evidence that it works for the betterment of education?</p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Issue 9 ─ Facilities</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Traditionally, vocational facilities have been large, unit shops or labs, with equipment that replicated that found in business or industry.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Is this still appropriate?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Can generic vocational courses be taught in industrial arts facilities?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If the answer to this question is no, what kind of facilities do we need for secondary vocational programs?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>How can the change of focus be best accommodated?</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Issue 10 ─ Counseling</b></p>
<p>	</p>
<p>Guidance counselors appear to give most of their time and attention to the university bound.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Students are often discouraged from electing vocational courses and frequently learn about such options from peers rather than professionals.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Most guidance counselors are not well versed in vocational options.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The non-university bound student is frequently viewed as a “trouble-maker” and a source of embarrassment to school personnel.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Early drop-out relieves schools of a nuisance.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>What is the role of the guidance counselor for a student who is not university or college bound?</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Issue 11 ─ Administration and Organization</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>At one time, comprehensive schools had principals or vice principals with a vocational background.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Today, fewer administrators seem to have emerged from among vocational instructional staff.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>People with vocational backgrounds are not emerging in leadership roles.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Even Departments of Education appear to be downgrading vocational expertise.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Are these statements true?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If so, why is this happening?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>What, if anything, should be done about it?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Can quality vocational programs be led by academic educators?</p>
<p>Specialized vocational high schools appear to be on the decline and vocational programs are now being delivered as part of comprehensive school offerings.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>What advantages does the comprehensive model of organization have for vocational education?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>What disadvantages?</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Issue 12 ─ Employment</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The decline in labor intensive jobs as a result of technology advances will certainly have an impact on the design and substance of secondary vocational education program sin the future.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Will high tech create new jobs?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Or will the growth of high technology obscure the fact that the demand for workers now and in the future will be in the service sector – secretaries, nursing aides, sales clerks, home service workers.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Is this switch reflected in secondary vocational education programs?</p>
