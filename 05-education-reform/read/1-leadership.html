<div class="reader-summary">Editor letter to Charlottetown Guardian (July 27, 2018) arguing that education, particularly public education, remains in &quot;constant turmoil&quot; with growing gap between needed and provided services. Analyzes three key issues: government education role overly narrowed to school operations (criticizing as equivalent to delivering all health through hospitals); &quot;fear factor&quot; and politicization limiting professional autonomy; and structural misalignment preventing adequate services. Notes structural change unlikely without systemic reorganization, though commends ministerial efforts.</div>

<p><b>Editor,</b></p>
<p><b>Charlottetown Guardian</b></p>
<p><b>Charlottetown, PEI	</b></p>
<p><b>D-1</b></p>
<p><b>Dear Sir:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b><b></b></p>
<p><b>Education leadership</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>It seems to me that education, especially public education, is in constant turmoil.; it’s been thus for many years; from my perspective, the gap between the education services<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>needed and education services provided gets wider and wider.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>While the current government is not the cause of the gap, successive governments seem unable or unwilling to effect required changes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Some roadblocks are considered structural.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><b>Mission</b></p>
<p>Most government departments adopt a role of “encouraging and supporting” their sector; not so for Education.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is focused on running schools.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It’s the equivalent of delivering all health services through hospitals. It’s a narrow focus and deprives students of some important educational experiences <span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></p>
<p><b>Fear factor</b></p>
<p>Books have been written about the “Fear Factor” in education.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It’s found to some extent in any large organization but it is compounded when that organization is government.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I attribute it to politization arising from the large measure of government intervention and control.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Autonomy and accountability for helping Islanders learn should be the domain of the professional<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>and those who practice education should have the same level of freedom and accountability as those who practice medicine or law. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><b>Structure</b></p>
<p>An education system is an array of programs and services put in place by a community to encourage and support the education of its residents; given the complexities of serving so many people, designing and operating an education system is no easy task.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Unfortunately, the current structure does not reflect the services normally required.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It appears that the desire to run schools overwhelms the system and and drowns out a number of other functions.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>While I commend the Minister and Department for their efforts to improve public education, the likelihood of meeting their objective is slim until structural issues are resolved.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Sincerely,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>t</p>
