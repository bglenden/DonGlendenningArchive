<div class="reader-summary">Don critiques the grading system, noting that despite being called &quot;absolutely uncalibrated&quot; since 1913, grades continue shaping young lives. He distinguishes formative assessment (diagnostic teaching tool) from summative assessment (sorting learners by achievement), arguing teachers shouldn&#x27;t rate students they teach due to conflict of interest. Standards should be set independently. He separates credentials (what was studied) from qualifications (what can be done), advocating for better assessment aligned with actual learning progress.</div>

<p>Dear Sir:</p>
<p><b>Calibrating educational achievement</b></p>
<p>The practice of grading students is thought to have originated at Yale in the late 1700’s and, in spite of being described in 1913 as “an absolutely uncalibrated instrument”, grades remain a significant component in determining the future of many young lives. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Although I’ve had concerns about the issue for some time, problems with the current grading system became much clear when Education 20/20 plotted a “Learning Path.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>(The Learning Path, Occasional Paper No. 4,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>HYPERLINK "http://www.education2020.ca" <span>www.education2020.ca</span>). The process was most revealing and confirmed my belief that:</p>
<p>Formative assessment is a diagnostic tool used by teachers as part of the teaching process, and provides teachers with valuable information about how to help students along the learning path.</p>
<p>Summative assessment is process of sorting learners by level of achievement and is not a teaching function.</p>
<p>Teachers should not set the requirements for achievement levels.</p>
<p>Teachers who participate in ranking and grading students constitute a conflict of interest.</p>
<p>Where standards are needed, they should be set and measured by a body independent of people who teach.</p>
<p>Credentials, diplomas and degrees, are marketing tools of teaching institutions and should not be confused with qualifications which describe what<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>a person can do; credentials tell what has been studied and not what has been learned.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>We need a better way to both describe and measure progress along the learning path.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p><br></p>
