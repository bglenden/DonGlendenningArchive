  26 News-Let-change
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Incomplete draft letter criticizing PEI Department of Education for focusing on efficiency rather than effectiveness, observing that change announcements only involve large expenditures. Don lists hoped-for improvements including increased school autonomy, quality emphasis, curriculum updates, and grading system reform. He identifies the lack of a visible change leader as a significant problem and comments critically on government idiosyncrasies that impede educational reform. The document appears to cut off mid-sentence.</div>
