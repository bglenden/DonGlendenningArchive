Mr.  Howatt:</span></p>
<p lang="en-US" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">This letter is a request for funds
in support of a workshop for educators and the public on the delivery
of courses to students on line, but first  some background about
Education 20/20 Inc.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">Education 20/20 Inc. is a national
not-for-profit organization whose purpose is to encourage and support
a quality education for every Canadian.  We are governed by a
volunteer Board , people who have demonstrated an interest in  and
knowledge of education but do not represent any institution or
institutional point of view.   Our purpose is to inform, educate,
provoke discussion, encourage, and support quality education and
lobby for change when the evidence warrants it.  We operate
independently, but cooperatively, with other organizations in a
transparent manner based on sound business practices. 
</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0.14in">As a result of
meetings and conversations with a large number of people throughout
the Island, we have found a widespread interest in and desire for
change on the part of the public and educators alike; there is also a
realization that the changes that are needed are unlikely to take
place without some external interventions.  As you know, changing an
existing organization is not easy but we believe that change is both
possible and necessary; our focus will be on learning rather than
teaching, because much of what is important in education occurs
outside schools.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Activities to date
include:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Publication
	of a newsletter, copy enclosed, directed to the public at large</p></li>
	<li><p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">An
	award to a school that best demonstrates the concept of engagement
	in its day to day activities</p></li>
	<li><p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Discussions
	with educators about the improvement in the level of literacy of
	Islanders, especially levels of reading.  
	</p></li>
	<li><p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">A
	series of workshops on innovation and best practices.</p></li>
</ul>
<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0in; margin-left: 0.5in; line-height: 100%">
<br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">To be more specific, MOOC’s
(Multiple Open On-line Courses) are now a fact of life; educators
need to learn how to take advantage of them.  To aid in
understanding, we have organized a workshop on the delivery of
courses on line.  Our instructor, Professor White-Hassler who has
many years of experience in computer based applications for teaching
and administration in Arizona, Alaska and Connecticut.  He has
offered a number of courses on line, is currently living on PEI and
delivering courses on line to students enrolled at Manchester
Community College in Connecticut.  In addition to his experience, I
have had a number of conversations with Professor White-Hassler and
am very impressed with his philosophy of education</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">We think that this course is a
natural fit with your company and are seeking your financial support
in amount of $350.  The course will be offered in Charlottetown on
May 14; an early response therefore would be appreciated.  We do not
have charitable status at the moment, however, the Community
Foundation for Prince Edward Island is supporting our initiatives and
can offer receipts acceptable for tax purposes.  Contributions should
be made to the Foundation a 119-121 Queen Street, Charlottetown, PEI,
C1A 4B3.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">I would be pleased to provide more
information about Education 20/20 Inc. our findings about education,
our activities in general or about the proposed course.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">Thank you for your consideration</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">Sincerely 
</p>
