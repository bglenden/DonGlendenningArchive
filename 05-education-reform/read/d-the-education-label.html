  D The education label
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Don critiques both employers and the school system for their approaches to hiring and credentialing. He argues employers spend insufficient time defining job requirements and evaluating actual competencies, instead relying on vague credentials. He suggests employers learn to &quot;read the label&quot; by consulting school principals and understanding transcript categories rather than blindly accepting degrees. The letter proposes a collaborative approach where employers specify needed skills upfront and schools align curricula accordingly, challenging the disconnect between education and workforce needs.</div>

<p>Dear Sir:</p>
<p><b>Employers Urged to Read the Label</b></p>
<p>One frequently hears stories about the employee who cannot make change without using a cash register, write simple reports, perform other skills even at a basic level.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The school system is usually blamed but should it be?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Perhaps employers should first remove the mote in their own eye.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I often scan the help wanted ads and am usually surprised at how little the tell about the wor to be done or the skills required to perform it. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Too few ask employees if they can read and write, or about any other skill.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When hiring, employers seem to be satisfied with knowing the make and model, an how long it took to make it. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My guess is that they put much more thought into the purchase of a new piece of equipmentI than they put into the hiring process.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Xpecifying skills needed is step one tineliminating the problem</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>A second step is to get to know your supplier, I’d start with the principal.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>With the applicants transcript before you, what I call the dducation label, ask what the categories mean and what you can expect od a holder. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>If you feel schools should have more autonomy, tell your MLA – and do it now while new regulations are being written. I’d also be interested in your views at standards2020@gmail.com</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
