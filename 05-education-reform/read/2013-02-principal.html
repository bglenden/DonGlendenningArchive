  2013-02 Principal
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">While reaffirming principal importance in school success, Don calls for shifted emphasis toward greater autonomy. Supported by OECD and New Zealand research linking school-level autonomy and accountability to student performance, Don advocates for principals&#x27; freedom to allocate operating funds uniquely, organize and fund professional development, select and assign staff matching school priorities, and lead outcome identification and program implementation. The letter balances recognition of principal leadership with conviction that greater autonomy—not constraint—maximizes effectiveness.</div>

<p>Dear Sir:</p>
<p><b>Principals make a difference</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>I’ve always thought that a principal makes a difference in a school, and I still do; while a teacher sets the tone of a classroom, a principal sets the tone of a school. By their personalities, by their knowledge and experience, and by their management style, principals create an environment that either supports or discourages effective learning; if given greater autonomy, I am sure that most would do even better.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This view is supported by a recent OECD study that found autonomy and accountability at the school level is a key to how well students perform, at least on PISA tests.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And out of New Zealand this morning as I write comes further evidence about the importance of a principal’s leadership role, this time in setting and achieving student outcomes.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>This letter is a call for a change of emphasis in the role of a principal; it is a plea to allow principals freedom to:</p>
<p>Allocate operating funds to better support activities unique to each school.</p>
<p>Organize and fund professional development for school personnel.</p>
<p>Select and assign staff in a manner that reflects the needs and priorities of students in that school, and to</p>
<p>Be a leader in identifying outcomes and implementing programs<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>There are other organizational models that I could support, however, given current organizational arrangements, principals play a key role in the quality of education that schools offer; greater autonomy for schools will not guarantee improvement but it will increase the odds that improvement will happen.</p>
<p>Feel free to share these views and your views, whether or not they are the same, with the new school board, and with me at<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>HYPERLINK "mailto:standards2020@gmail.com" <span>standards2020@gmail.com</span><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
