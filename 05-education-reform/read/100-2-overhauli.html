</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Editor letter addressing &quot;credibility gap&quot; between PEI education and community, describing system as fragmented, cognitively narrow, bureaucratic, lacking accountability and self-correction. Notes government inherited problematic structure but bears responsibility for improvement. Recommends broadening education definition beyond school-to-youth focus, organizing by functions rather than institutions, adopting PISA recommendations (school autonomy and accountability), developing independent qualification authorities, and shifting focus from institutions/programs to learners/learning. Includes supporting outline of current problems and first steps (vision, functional organization, autonomy, accountability).</div>

<p><b>Editor</b></p>
<p><b>PEI Education Needs an Overhaul</b></p>
<p><b>There is a growing credibility gap between education and the community it serves; education services on PEI are fragmented, cognitively based, bureaucratic, lack accountability and a self-correcting mechanism.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I do not, we cannot, blame the current government, the previous government or any single government that went before for the current status; we do, however, expecblame governments for not instituting improvement. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b>While it is true that opportunities for improvement abound throughout the system, it is the writers view that much of the needed change is blocked by an outdated structure; to initiate the improvement process. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li1"><b>Broaden our definition. </b>PEI has a very narrow view of education – much narrower than that encountered on my arrival in PEI<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>50<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>years ago; narrower in terms of both offerings and availability.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Government sees its role is to deliver programs in French and English to young people.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There is no indication that learning is a developmental process nor mention of support for adult learners or encouraging independent and part time learners.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Yhe addition of Early childhood development by the previous<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>government and “life long learning” to the name of the Department implies that they are not legitimate parts<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></li>
  <li class="li1"><b>Organize based on functions: </b>I may be out of date on this issue but I was taught that in designing an organization, form follows function.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Typical function include funding, instruction,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>education products, information an counselling, quality control. Aligning the organization with functions would, I suggest, improve both communication and efficiency.</li>
  <li class="li1"><b>Adopt PISA recommendarion</b></li>
  <li class="li1">Public educators cite PISA and other rst results in support of educational improvement; yet the system ignores the findings of the OECD, the creator of PISA, when it poinys out tht PISA results are<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>better in schools that provide schools with a significant measure of autonomy in the ir day to day operations and hold schools accountable for school results. Significant measure of autonomy and accountability shifted to front line staff</li>
  <li class="li1"><b>I have never been a great believer in school document as a measure of what has been learned;<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I prefer transcripts.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Most western countries, other than Canada and the USA. I am told, have developed qualification authorities to help translation of the myriad of school credit systems.</b></li>
  <li class="li1"><b>A system focused on learners and learning rather than institutions and programs.</b></li>
</ul>
