  Vocational
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">A personal reflection on what makes education &quot;vocational&quot; rather than academic. Don draws on his unique position as one of the few New Brunswick teachers holding both academic and vocational licenses. He argues that vocational education&#x27;s essence lies not in program naming, duration, or institutional designation, but in the learner&#x27;s purpose. He introduces the concept of &quot;life roles&quot; (learner, citizen, family member, individual, producer, consumer) and argues that vocational education develops skills for the producer role. He emphasizes that performance standards in vocational contexts measure quality and quantity of work similar to employment standards, making this the defining characteristic that distinguishes vocational from general education regardless of content.</div>

<p><b>WHAT MAKES EDUCATION VOCATIONAL?</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>For most of my life, I have been a vocational educator, and proud of it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The truth is, however, that my early training and experience were in academic or general education, and my major in graduate school was in secondary education. In addition, I was one of a very small number of teachers in New Brunswick who held both an academic and a vocational teacher’s license.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Those who read my letters to the editor will, I believe, find that they address a broad rather than the narrower field. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The term vocational has long lost its luster in North America but, I am told, is still perfectly acceptable elsewhere in the world.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That being the case, some potential readers may have already passed this subject by.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>For those still reading, I am referring to that part of one’s education designed to help one earn a living.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Many vocational programs are identified quickly by their names; welding, carpentry, electrical, mechanics and machinist are examples.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Some would add cooking, photography, secretarial, and many others. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Each of these is an integrated program of studies leading to a recognized<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>qualification. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Is a single course within one of these programs be considered a vocational course?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Probably.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>How about on unit within a course such as using power tools?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Could be.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Where do we draw the line?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Or is a line even needed?</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Or perhaps we determine “vocationalness”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>of programs is by the number of years of schooling required to gain entry.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Fifty years ago that my have been the case; one could enter most trades after Grade 8 or 10 but graduation from high school was required to enter University.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Community colleges were not part of the education scene at that time<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>But that has changed and now you need high school graduation for entry into most any education program.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>One could consider the length of training program as a factor in distinguishing vocational programs.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>With the advent of institutes of technology, the Canadian pattern seemed to be one year for a vocational program, two or three years for a<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>technology or technologist program and four or more years for a degree.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But that has changed also</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Maybe vocational programs can be distinguished by the designation awarded by the training institution; but that does not seem to be the case either.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Collelges give both diplomas and degrees, as do universities.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Somme diploma programs require a degree for entrance while others provide entry directly from high school.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>.Or perhaps the name of the institution est identifies whether or not it offers vocational courses.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But that does not seem to work<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>either because, for example, you can find acconting courses that are essentially the same being offered in secondary schools, community colleges, universities and in the private sector.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>In thinking about the subject, Icame across “life roles” as developed in the State of Oregon; these life roles are that of learner, citizen, family member, individual, producer and consumer.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The focus and emphasis may change throughout one’s life, but the roles remain. Preparation for these roles underlies all schooling, although preparation for these roles is seldom clearly understood and even more rarely stated.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In addition, many of the attitudes, skills, and knowledges basic to one role apply also to others.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In other words, while the roles may be discretely identified, preparation for roles have significant overlap.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The final point I will make is that of program or course standards.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The performance of a person learning for vocational purposes is measured in the same way as the performance of a person employed in the field.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The performance of a person employed in a field is usually measured against such criteria as both quality and quantity of work performed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Performance may also take into account the degree of supervision required or even special problem solving capability.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>For a non-vocational student, the rating is usually on the quality of the final product regardless of how long the learner spent or how much supervision was required.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Vocational education, therefore, is that part of one’s education designed to develop and improve those skills used by the learner in his/her role as a producer.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is the learner’s purpose that determines whether or not a course is vocational.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Two people may study the same subject together with one interested because of his work and the other staking the course as a hobby.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This applies to all the content being studied whether the skills being learned are general, technical, general and personal</p>
