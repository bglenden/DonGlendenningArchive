  4 Reading criteria
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Extensive document detailing reading skill assessment and improvement framework. Defines reading as &quot;ability to use printed information as meaningful language&quot; with key assessment criteria (range of material, comprehension, fluency, independence, speed, vocabulary, flow). Establishes seven-level performance scale with benchmarks (e.g., Level 3 = reading daily newspaper with comprehension). Identifies reading issues (program emphasis gaps, funding continuity, specialist availability) and intervention points (standards setting, rating scale development, assessment training, reading clinics, specialized teacher roles). Comprehensively addresses reading competency components (phonemic awareness, fluency, vocabulary, comprehension), teaching approaches (phonics, rime-based instruction), and evidence-based instruction strategies (previewing, predicting, skimming, context guessing). Includes detailed statistics on literacy crisis and recommendations for systematic reading improvement including outcome identification, benchmark setting, teacher training, specialist support, and community engagement. Proposes establishment of reading organizations, societies, and support structures. Demonstrates Don&#x27;s systematic, evidence-based approach to addressing a major educational need.
- **Key People**: Don Glendenning (author); National Reading Panel (referenced); Kotter (change management); various literacy researchers
- **Key Organizations**: Department of Education, schools, libraries, reading clinics, teacher organizations, parents groups, communities
- **Tags**: EDUCATION, PROFESSIONAL, COMMUNITY
- **Eulogy Relevance**: HIGH - Comprehensive demonstration of Don&#x27;s analytical and strategic approach to educational problems; shows his commitment to evidence-based, systematic reform addressing real community needs; includes innovative institutional proposals</div>

<p><b>Statistics:</b></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li9"><b>Phonemic awareness</b>: The ability to distinguish and manipulate the individual sounds of language. The broader term, phonological awareness, also includes rhymes, syllables, and onsets and rimes.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
</ul>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li9"><b>Fluency</b>: The ability to read orally with speed, accuracy, and vocal expression. The ability to read fluently is one of several critical factors necessary for reading comprehension. If a reader is not fluent, it may be difficult to remember what has been read and to relate the ideas expressed in the text to his or her background knowledge. This accuracy and automaticity of reading serves as a bridge between decoding and comprehension.<span><sup>[11]</sup></span><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
</ul>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li9"><b>Vocabulary</b>: A critical aspect of reading comprehension is vocabulary development. When a reader encounters an unfamiliar word in print and decodes it to derive its spoken pronunciation, the reader understands the word if it is in the reader's spoken vocabulary. Otherwise, the reader must derive the meaning of the word using another strategy, such as context.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
</ul>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li9"><b>Reading comprehension</b>: The NRP describes comprehension as a complex cognitive process in which a reader intentionally and interactively engages with the text. Reading comprehension is heavily dependent on skilled word recognition and decoding, oral reading fluency, a well-developed vocabulary and active engagement with the text.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
</ul>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li9"><b>Rapid automatized naming</b>: The ability to quickly say the names of letters, objects and colors predicts an individual's ability to read. This might be linked to the importance of quick retrieval of phonological representations from long-term memory in reading and the importance of object-naming circuits in the left cerebral hemisphere that are recruited to underpin a child's word-recognition abilities.<span><sup>[9]</sup></span><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
</ul>
<p>Phonics is a teaching method that stresses the acquisition of letter-sound correspondences and their use in reading and spelling. This helps beginning readers understand how letters are linked to sounds (phonemes), patterns of letter-sound correspondences and spelling in English, and how to apply this knowledge when they read. For struggling readers, traditional phonics instruction can have the unintended consequence of promoting dysfluency. The difficulty lies in the coarticulated nature of speech. Speech sounds are overlapping,<span><sup>[12]</sup></span> while print is discrete and sequential. This can be appreciated if one shapes the mouth in position to begin to produce the word <i>cat</i> compared to the word <i>cot</i>. The initial hard <i>c</i> is colored by the subsequent vowel even before speech begins, i.e., the smiling position as one prepares to say <i>cat</i>, and the more limp position as one prepares to say <i>cot</i>. As early readers work from left to right, beginning with the onset consonant, they typically do not yet know the vowel with which it must be coarticulated. The vowel sound itself cannot be known until the remaining rime (the portion of the syllable beginning with the vowel and extending to its end: e.g. <i>ight</i> in <i>right</i>) is fully encountered.</p>
<p>For these reasons, teaching reading through orientation to rime first and then adding the onset (ought-bought) can be helpful in promoting fluency through supporting the phonological problems of coarticulation. Emphasis on the rime also supports the development of an intuitive, and therefore more fluent, awareness of orthographic patterns.<span><sup>[13]</sup></span></p>

  <li class="li3"> The Ministers of Education (?) in the Atlantic Provinces are much aware of the need for improvement and Departments of Education have launched new initiatives directed at the problem.
