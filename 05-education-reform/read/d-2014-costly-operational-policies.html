  D 2014 costly operational policies
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Don explains why education faces more reform pressure than health or justice services, identifying four key problems: public schools lack market incentives for improvement, operation follows formulas (ratios, hours, salaries) rather than standards, scripted curricula ignore individual needs, and services are bundled through single providers. He articulates government&#x27;s appropriate roles: providing leadership, funding, access, learning culture, quality monitoring, and accountability reporting—notably excluding direct school operation. This letter synthesizes his governance philosophy, emphasizing market mechanisms and accountability within government-funded systems.</div>

<p>Dear Sir:</p>
<p><b>Role of Government<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>There is growing pressure for change in education, more pressure than I’ve seen on any other government department.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>One cannot help but wonder why.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Compared to health a and justice services, There are many reason; my initial examination suggests the following:</p>
<p>Public schools are not market sensitive; no financial incentive to produce a better product or to do it more efficiently.</p>
<p>Operation of schools is largely formulae driven (student teacher ratio, hours of instruction rather than standards achieved, salaries based on credentials rather than nature and level of position)<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Schools deliver a scripted curriculum to all regardless of individual interests and needs</p>
<p>Services (instruction, credentials and assessment) are bundled and available through only one supplier.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Public or private</b></p>
<p><b>Choice or determined</b></p>
<p><b>Employees or self employed<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b>Education or knowledge</b></p>
<p><b>Education or school based</b></p>
<p><b>Bundled or diverse</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>I understand why a government believes that education is important and why it should have a Department of Education; what puzzles me, however, is why government wants to, or thinks it should, actually operate schools. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Schooling is only part, and a declining part at that, of what constitutes an education system, yet it appears to consume most of the Department’s time and energy.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>So why does the Department operate our public schools?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I’ve asked the question of many people and no one has been able to provide a plausible answer. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Government is preoccupied with schools to the detriment of education; it needs to step back from the daily operation and assume a leadership role.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Education would benefit from less bureaucracy, more school autonomy,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>greater engagement and and increased accountability for student progress.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Delegating operational responsibility should also depoliticize most educational issues.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>My thinking is that Government’s role is to:</p>
<p>Provide leadership</p>
<p>Provide funding</p>
<p>Ensure access</p>
<p>Create a learning culture</p>
<p>Monitor quality, consistency and fairness.</p>
<p>Report to its citizens</p>
<p><br></p>
