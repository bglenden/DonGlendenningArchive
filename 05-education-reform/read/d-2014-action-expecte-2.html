  D 2014 Action expecte -2 
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Dated January 25, 2014, Don establishes foundational premises for his educational critique: most young people can achieve subject mastery given appropriate support, and schools cannot blame communities or homes for student failure. He documents widespread Islander concern that graduating students lack basic reading, writing, and arithmetic skills. He argues that government, having monopolized education delivery and limited competition, owes Islanders explanation and action plans. This letter encapsulates his fundamental conviction that schools must ensure foundational competencies for all students.</div>

<p>Dear Sir:</p>
<p><b>Action expected<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I start from the premise that most young people can learn most things that schools offer although it may take some a little longer than others; failure to reach a desired standard cannot and should not be blamed on either the community or the home, but may require an adjustment in the nature or extent of services needed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Lack of support in the home or school may be a factor but is not an acceptable excuse.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Islanders want their schools to provide young people with a reasonable level of reading, writing and arithmetic; but they are of the view that that is not happening at the moment and may even be getting worse.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It appears that many young people are graduating from high school without the basic skills needed to access further studies or enter employment.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The view must be valid because so far at least, government has not explained, denied or refuted this view.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If this were in any other field, Islanders would simply take their business elsewhere, and that is only possible for the people who can afford it. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Islanders are concerned; they expect action and they also expect to be consulted. As long as government continues, not only to run schools, but to limit competition, it owes Islanders an explanation and a plan of action; the alternative is to withdraw from<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>being the operator.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>This is likely as good a place as any to begin the improvement process.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
