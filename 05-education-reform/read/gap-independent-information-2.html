  Gap - independent information 2
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">From December 1, 2013, Don identifies a critical information gap: insufficient independent, practical information for educational decision-making beyond school. He describes conversations with students unable to assess course implications, employers dismissing report cards as useless (proposing independent assessment bodies like Royal Canadian Conservatory of Music as models), and parents and graduates seeking better career information. He argues career counseling should relocate from schools to community access centers open evenings and Saturdays, making services available to post-secondary adults. This reflects systems thinking beyond traditional schooling.</div>

<p><br></p>
<p>Dear Sir:</p>
<p><b>Information gap</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>Although we are in an information age, there appears to be a shortage of independent information about education available to people making decisions about their education. The exception is young people still in school, is either available to in-school youth who are college and university bound or people who qualify for training under a federally funded program.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Let me tell you about some recent conversations:</p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li1">Students either take or drop subjects without being fully aware of the implications.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As a result students may not meet entrance requirements for postsecondary institutions, the military or apprenticeship.</li>
  <li class="li1">Employers see chool report cards and credentials are declining in value as measures of achievement and, at least at the moment, there is no alternative measure they can turn to or as for.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>there is a need, I believe, for an independent body, something on the model of the Royal Canadian Conservatory of Music, to establish levels of achievement<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>or the National Swimming levels.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>An external body to provide independent assessment of a person’s level of achievement</li>
  <li class="li1">Parents still remain a major source of help to students when deciding ehat to do next; need more and better information also;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li1"></li>
  <li class="li1"></li>
  <li class="li1"></li>
  <li class="li1"></li>
  <li class="li1"></li>
  <li class="li1">mpleted school 2-3 years ago, is only casually employed, living with parents.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></li>
  <li class="li1">Parents with limited formal education and a son about to graduate but with little interest in further education, no skill training courses in his school.</li>
  <li class="li1">A small construction contractor with a vacancy, in conversation with a potential employee and looking at a grade of “C”on a report card.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>What<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>can the employee do with a C?</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>There is a shortage of information about education matters available<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>available to peoplemajor gap in the information about education available toand what there is, is focused on students still in school or interested in further studies; I find it a bit like going to one of the local churches seeking help with life’s choices.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In both cases, you’ve already chosen the lens, or is it the filter, through which information will be provided.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I’ve heard the plea for more and better information most recently from parents, students and young adults; their’s is a plea for more better and even independent information on which to make career choices.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>(I’ve also heard a plea from parents about more informative report cards and from employers about educational levels, but I’ll save those for later letters.)</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>This need first became evident to me when charting<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>a learning diagram; the learner often needs information to give put learning in perspective but also to make choices about future learning; and teachers need information in order to plan an appropriate teaching strategy.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>it seems, make important choices based on insufficient and perhaps even erroneous information.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The most frequent examples mentioned were decisions about career choices, about having chosen courses in school that resulted in not qualifying for some programs in college, university or apprenticeships, and general information about what to expect in your first full time job. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Most of the information and counsel available and needed, it seems, is housed in a school and not readily accessible to parents or to students who have already graduated.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Furthermore, while newspapers carry items on education, they are seldom of the nature to be helpful in making educational decisions.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And as we know, important career decisions involve more than simply selecting appropriate mix an level of courses.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Career counselling is not a school issue.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>One option is to relocate career counselling services from schools to Access Centres, or some other facility open to the public at large and open during evenings and on Saturdays.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Another option would be to house it with some of our service or youth clubs</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Career counselling is a education function but reaches beyond schools</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>o While career decision making is an educational matter, it is not a school matter.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is make career information and advice more widely to Islanders<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>of all ages.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>timeThere is no question in my mind that more and better information is needed but it should be housed in the communiMore should be done but, in my view, not The provision ofNow I am not suggesting that the provision of information about education<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I believe it is a legitimate concer</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li1">Course selection while in school – students take courses only to find out later that they the courses not acceptable for entry into their chosen field of study</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li1">Knowledge of and skills for the workplace – Students coming out of school would like to know more<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>about,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>how to especially personal management skills<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li1">Reading -<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They know that reading is important, feel that they should be better informed on how to help and on the options for their child<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Closing the expectation gap is both urgent and simple; a simple statement perhaps by the School Board, is the first step.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Whatever the statement, it should be prominently displayed for use by providers and users alike.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Ask your neighbours, your principal or even your MLA what if they think schools should help young people prepare for work and of course, your views are always<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>welcome at<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>standards2020@gmail.com.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p>A few days ago, I picked up a copy of the Vital Signs report published by the Community Foundation (www.cfpei.ca).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>While the Report dealt with a number of issues facing Island youth, my particular interest is youth views on education.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Quite a few respondents to the survey were not satisfied with the quality, nature or extent of their education, especially in relation to preparedness for work.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Students expect their schooling help prepare them for employment not just for further education. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
