<div class="reader-summary">Framework document outlining a comprehensive approach to organizing education services on PEI. Don articulates education as a lifelong, multi-role process spanning individual, family, citizen, student, consumer, and producer roles. Identifies eight core education functions (Information, Instruction, Feedback, Counselling, Funding, Products/Technology, Leadership/Governance) and critiques the current focus on age-based institutional delivery rather than service-based organization. References &quot;Education 2020&quot; initiative and the &quot;Road of Life&quot; framework.</div>

<p><b>FRAMEWORK FOR ORGANIZING<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b>EDUCATION SERVICES ON PEI</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>Some 150,000 people call PEI home; they differ dramatically from each other in terms of n age, interests, address, education, experience, aspirations, level of good fortune, physical, mental and emotional state.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>As they travel the road of life. a metaphor for the experiences one encounters between birth and death, each person fills a number of life roes, that of that of being an individual, a family member, a citizen, a student, a consumer and producer. They also encounter many obstacles including time, age, personal and family responsibilities, geography and funding, obstacles which may even be compounded and compromised by those we meet along the way: they also encounter obstcles that can be mastered by improved education – lack of skills, qualifications, and credentials. and of course he personal baggage of culture and our personal make up.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>At any point they may find that that the skills they have and the skills they need will frequently differ.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The process of developing new skills, knowledge and attitudes is called learning and the discernable change that occur in us as a result of learning is called education. Education 20/20 convened a group of learners; they told us they needed, but not necessarily at the same time, Information, counselling, demonstrations, instruction, diagnosis,, learning plans, encouragement, etc. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Provinces, as the level of government responsible for education, typically put together the following functions or services in support of the education of its citizens.</p>
<p>•	Information: recent, independent, reliable, timel<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>•	Instruction: presentation, tutoring, demonstrations, debate, diagnosis, coaching and guided practice.</p>
<p>•	Feedback:<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>effective, valid, transparent, relevant</p>
<p>•	Counselling: planning, coaching, referral, advocacy</p>
<p>•	Funding: access, space, time, funding, practice</p>
<p>•	Products and technologies: texts, reference, self instructional material, MOOC’s and assistive technologies</p>
<p>•	Leadership and Governance: Planning, research, advocacy, encouragement, quality assurance.</p>

<p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Deliver educational services typically involves the following functions, Provinces<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>put together a set of institutions, systems and services</p>
<p>Where do we start and how do we put it all together; Need an education system</p>
<p>Develop a set of guiding principles such s:</p>
<p>Encourage everybody</p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li7">Province will encourage and promote education among its citizens</li>
  <li class="li7">Province will cover full cost of the following education services: literacy, numeracy, self management,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>required for citizenship in a modern economy</li>
  <li class="li7">Every Islander or Island family<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>will have access to a professional education adviser,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li7">Establish Independent qualification authority</li>
  <li class="li7">Directtors of educational services<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>geographic<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p>An education system is put in place by a community to encourage and support the education of its people; Typical education services to a community, known as functions to the organization offering them, include:</p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li7"><b>Information: </b>recent, independent, reliable<b>, </b>timel<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li7"><b>Instruction: </b>presentation, tutoring, demonstrations, debate, diagnosis, coaching and guided practice.</li>
</ul>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li7"><b>Feedback:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b> effective, valid, transparent, relevant</li>
  <li class="li7"><b>Counselling: </b>planning, coaching, referral, advocacy</li>
  <li class="li7"><b>Funding: </b>access, space, time, funding, practice</li>
  <li class="li7"><b>Products and technologies: </b>texts, reference, self instructional material, MOOC’s and assistive technologies</li>
  <li class="li7"><b>Leadership and Governance:</b> Planning, research, advocacy, encouragement, quality assurance.</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p>. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Under the British North America Act, education in Canada is a provincial responsibility, however, both levels of government are major investors; support is provided for two reasons,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>firstly for the benefit of individual citizens and, secondly to ensure the availability of the skilled people needed to maintain<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>the future of the community in which citizens live.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p>The nature and availability of a quality education will, in large measure, determine the future of individual Canadians, Canadian communities and Canada itself; in view of its importance and given the concern about the state of public education, some thoughts<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>on a framework for making educational decisions may be in order.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The Road of Life is one such framework; it starts with the view that one’s education is preparation for the next stage on the road of life.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Having a framework for learning increases the chances of making relevant decisions and making those decisions more consistently.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It also provides common language and perspectives when collaborating with colleagues in the field.</p>
