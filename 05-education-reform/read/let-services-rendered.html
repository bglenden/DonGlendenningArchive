</div>

<div class="reader-summary">A letter to the editor of the Charlottetown Guardian (July 27, 2018) signed by Don Glendenning. The letter addresses PEI&#x27;s substantial education budget (approximately $250 million annually, about $12,000 per student) and questions how educational services are organized and delivered. Don contrasts provider-driven versus user-driven systems and notes that PEI self-delivers most services through schools, resulting in a &quot;politicized, bureaucratic, out of date&quot; culture lacking accountability. He suggests alternatives including educational centers that co-locate services in community centers. The letter calls for developing a clear educational philosophy and long-term goals emphasizing a learning culture that fosters continuing education, accountability, self-reliance, and collaboration. The closing lists aspirational goals: &quot;all can learn,&quot; &quot;all will learn,&quot; &quot;learn together.&quot;</div>

<p><b>Editor,</b></p>
<p><b>Charlottetown Guardian</b></p>
<p><b>Charlottetown, PEI	</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Dear Sir:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b><b></b></p>
<p><b>For services rendered</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Education is a big budget item. If my figures are correct, last year the Government of PEI spent about $250 million on public education services alone.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That’s about $12,000 per student which, I’m told, is similar to the cost per student for similar services elsewhere in the country.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The government does this so that Islanders can develop the skills, knowledge and attitudes needed to survive, live and thrive in the years ahead. But some of that money is intended to ensure that our “Mighty Island” has the skills needed to ensure is mightiness.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Encouraging and supporting education involves a number of services; typically, we think of funding, instruction, diagnosis, assessment, educational products, technology, information, counselling, quality assurance, administration and leadership. How best to organize and deliver services is seldom debated, should he system be user or provider driven? <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Schools, like shopping malls, are simply places organized by suppliers of some volume educational services, but they are not necessarily best for all services or all learners.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The PEI Government has chosen to self-deliver practically all public education services.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It does this mostly through schools,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The result is a culture that is politicized, bureaucratic, out of date and lacking accountability. Other possibilities include giving each Islander $12,000 and let them find and manage their own learning. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>the health system under which citizens have a professional advisors and products and services; perhaps a supply management approach could work best in small communities.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Education centes, co-locating ducations svics a community centres</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>So, whither bound? Unfortunately, we do not know. Our philosophy of education us unclear. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b>Develop a learning culture that fosters continuing education, accountsbility, self reliance, collaboration</b></p>
<p><b>Long term goals</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>In this together</b></p>
<p><b>all csn learn</b></p>
<p><b>All will learn</b></p>
<p><b>Learn together</b></p>
