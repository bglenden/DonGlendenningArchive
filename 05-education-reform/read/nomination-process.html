  Nomination process
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Internal reflective memo from Don Glendenning analyzing the governance question of whether to request government distribution of award materials through the Department of Education. Don systematically examines his reasoning through a series of questions: whether requesting distribution represents approval-seeking, cost-saving, courtesy, or endorsement. Considers whether Department distribution ensures wider reach, adds prestige, or fits government guidelines. Reflects on consistency: if awards were in health or justice, would the relevant department distribute? Anticipates future awards in Nova Brunswick or Nova Scotia and whether similar departments would be expected to distribute. Concludes that Education 20/20 should merely inform the Department courtesy while requesting nothing more. Demonstrates Don&#x27;s thoughtful governance philosophy and commitment to organizational independence.</div>

<p>Award</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Since our conversation, I’ve been wrestling with the question of how we should deal with the Department in announcing our education award..</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I think that we agree that the nomination papers, (announcement, guidelines and references) wil be put on our website for people to read and down load, if interested.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It seems to me that the Committee TOR and the conflict of interest rules are our internal documents.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>So my questions to myself run something like this? <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li3">Why should we ask the government internal mail system or the department  to distribute an announcement or nomination papers</li>
</ul>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li3">A form of approval?</li>
  <li class="li3">Save money/</li>
  <li class="li4">Want their blessing?</li>
  <li class="li4">Courtesy?</li>
  <li class="li4">Ensures notice to more peple?</li>
  <li class="li4">Schools will initiate nomination process?</li>
  <li class="li4">To give advance notice?</li>
  <li class="li4">Endorsement?</li>
</ul>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li4">Would having the Department distribute the papers ensure wider distribution?</li>
  <li class="li4">Why should the government bear the cost of distribution?</li>
  <li class="li4">Would it add prestige to the award?</li>
  <li class="li4">Does it fit within government guidelines as to information schools will circulate?</li>
  <li class="li4">Increase chances of getting nominations?</li>
  <li class="li4">If we were making an award in the field of health or justice, would we ask the DM to circulate a nomination package?</li>
  <li class="li4">Next year, if we have a sponsor for an award, in NB or NS, will we expect their Departments to distribute announcements?</li>
  <li class="li4">Do we expect nominations to come back through Department mail?</li>
</ul>
<p>The more I reflect on this issue, the more I believe that we simply hould inform the Department out of courtesy but ask nothing more; I can think of other issues where I might conclude otherwise.</p>
<p>I simply wanted to share my thinking process; do not expect a response to each question but would be interested in your or other views.</p>
<p>Regards</p>
<p>Don</p>
