  102-b Role of Gov
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Substantial draft paper addressing education system overhaul. Criticizes government&#x27;s narrow definition conflating education with schooling, cites OECD and Donald Savoie on government effectiveness, and proposes structural reforms including autonomy, accountability, functional organization, and clear vision. References learner-centered approaches and the principle that early childhood experiences shape personality patterns.</div>

<p><b>Not sure what government id trying to do</b></p>
<p><b>Role of government in education	103</b></p>
<p><b>Time for an overhaul of education</b></p>
<p><b>Communities are of the view that education is important; in response, government has put in place an education system, an array of programs and services to encourage and support the education of its citizens .Governments do so for two reasons; (1) to support the education of its citizens and (2) because they need skilled people to ensure the viability of the commniity in which they live. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Education support typically comes in the form of funding, regulation, information,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>counselling, instruction, quality assurance, education products.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b>Communities suffer, however, because government narrowly defines education (using education and schooling interchangeably) , by labelling of<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>the portfolios as “Education and lifelong Learning” or,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>as the case of the<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>former Government, “Education and Early Childhood Development”, <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Government fails to recognize that education already<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>encompasses both. In addition, Government has a patchy record when it comes to responding to community needs,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>part time and continuing education, services to small<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>communities. I<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>’ve reported before on he interest of Souris residents in lifelong learning,limited offerings on psrt time ssnd ecening in practical and hands on training and in online courses. Nor do they address the issue of quality seem to operate</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Encouragement is quite straight forward and could be as simple as providing information. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Then we need some overarching statements g principle such as:</b></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li2"><b>PEI will underwrite the cost of instruction in literacy up to level three (whatever that is)</b></li>
  <li class="li2"><b>Instructional services in literacy will be provided through public schools</b></li>
  <li class="li2"><b>Te fundamental responsibility for education rests with the family</b></li>
  <li class="li2"><b>Funding for post secondary education will be provided through grants to families</b></li>
  <li class="li2"><b>Achievement levels will e st and measured by a body independent of schools .grants to families (Like post-war veterans’ training)<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></li>
  <li class="li2"><b>Information and counselling will be provided through a series of education offices strategically located across the Island</b></li>
  <li class="li2"><b>Learning model</b></li>
  <li class="li2"><b>Organization of rvices wil follow rganizational best practices.</b></li>
  <li class="li2"><b></b></li>
</ul>
<p><b>t is my view that while many changes are being introduced, it is unlikely that they will<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>bring about the desired inprovements uti, the structure itself<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>is improved</b></p>
<p><b>Sincerely</b></p>
<p><b>.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Ii is a key portfolio and one that should not be confused with the running of schools</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>•	Donald Savoie, did not mention education in his book “What government is good at”, he does say that government generally shouldn’t run things.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The OECD tells us that students do better on “PISA” exams in schools that have autonomy<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>and accountability for their day to day operation; the attached paper from the Montreal Economic Institute supports the OECD view.</b></p>
<p><b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>My own examination of the education system on PEI reveals a very narrow mandate (to deliver programs to schools), an organization that ignores a major organizational principle (form follows function).</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Current situation</b></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li6"><b>Isolated<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></li>
  <li class="li6"><b>Fragmented</b></li>
  <li class="li6"><b>Narrow focused on instruction not education</b></li>
  <li class="li6"><b>Not meeting public expectations</b></li>
  <li class="li6"><b>Bureaucratic<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></li>
  <li class="li6"><b>Politicized/fear factor</b></li>
</ul>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Responsibility</b></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li6"><b>Current govt inherited</b></li>
</ul>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li6"><b>Has responsibility to make it better</b></li>
</ul>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li6"><b>At the moment, Premier appears to be only person with the responsibility</b></li>
  <li class="li6"><b>Govt has leadership responsibility</b></li>
</ul>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>What literature says</b></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li6"><b>Know how to make it better;</b></li>
  <li class="li6"><b>OECD</b></li>
</ul>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>First steps</b></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li6"><b>Vision</b></li>
  <li class="li6"><b>Functional organization</b></li>
  <li class="li6"><b>Allow Autonomy</b></li>
  <li class="li6"><b>Accountability</b></li>
</ul>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>\xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx</b></p>
<p><b>We are all born with roughly the same level of education; then our experiences as a family and community member begins to shape us</b></p>
<p><b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>until about age six our personality patterns are pretty well set; a least that’s what my psychology professor told me; this is why the early years are so important. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
