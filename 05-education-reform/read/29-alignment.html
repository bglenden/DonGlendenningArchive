  29 Alignment
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Using vehicle alignment as metaphor, Don identifies misalignments requiring attention in school systems: between school practice and research, outcomes and life roles, assessment and real-world standards, reporting and stated outcomes, timetables and individual learning speeds, and benchmarks and community standards. He advises parents concerned about student progress to review course outcomes with their child before parent-teacher meetings, then bring these outcomes to discussions. Don notes that course outcomes are sometimes provided during course orientation and are available on the Department of Education website, positioning knowledge of outcomes as essential to productive parent-school conversations.</div>

<p>Dear Sir:</p>
<p><b>School alignment<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>It’s not unusual at this time of year to have our cars checked for alignment; we may not realize it, but school systems also struggle with alignment issues.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>While educators usually think only of curriculum alignment, we need to also check alignment of:</p>
<p>School practice and research</p>
<p>Outcomes with life roles</p>
<p>Assessment criteria with those in life outside school</p>
<p>School reporting with specified outcomes</p>
<p>Timetables and individual learning speeds<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Benchmarks and community standards</p>
<p>priorities</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Improving alignment may require changing priorities, rewriting resource material, adding community members to committees, making surveys, If you have concerns about your child’s progress, I suggest that start with the course outcomes, review them first with your child then take them to the parent teacher meeting.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Doing so will help focus the discussion.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In fact, sometimes copies of relevant outcomes are given to each student as part of the orientation process at the beginning of each new course.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If not, they are readily available on the website of the Department of Education</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p><br></p>
