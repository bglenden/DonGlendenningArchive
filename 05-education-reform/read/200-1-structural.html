  200-1 Structural
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Newsletter No. 95 (August 20, 2020) analyzing structural impediments to PEI education quality. Don defines structural issues as policies, procedures, culture, teaching approaches, and physical dimensions interfering with quality. He identifies seven key impediments: political filtering through government departments, narrowed vision compared to 50 years prior, lack of professional autonomy (both principals and teachers &quot;non-existent&quot;), inadequate accountability focused on school operations rather than skill development outcomes, &quot;fear factor&quot; discouraging open discourse, product-oriented (credentials-focused) rather than service-oriented approaches, and undervalued vocational/technical education. Don cites OECD PISA research and proposes &quot;clear, compelling&quot; vision as starting point. This synthesizes his systemic critique.</div>

	<b>STRUCTURAL
	IMPEDIMENTS</b></p>
	<p align="justify" style="margin-right: 0.01in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%; background: #ffffff">
	A
	few years ago, I chaired a half dozen public sessions  across PEI
	about the education concerns of youth. Sometimes, discussions
	continued long after sessions closed. After one session, a side
	discussion between two trustees  turned to “structural
	impediments” to better education. A recent reading of a World Bank
	report on education, although not using the term “structural”,
	reminded me of trustee comments and prompted this letter.

	By
	structural issues, I refer to “policies, procedures, culture,
	teachers, and physical dimensions”  of the educational framework
	that interfere with educational quality.

	Examples:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><p align="justify" style="margin-right: 0.01in; orphans: 2; margin-bottom: 0in; widows: 2; line-height: 100%; background: #ffffff">
		Political
		filter:
		Provincial Governments have a leadership role in encouraging,
		supporting and regulating education. But embedding the delivery 
		process in a government depa rtment seem to simply add to the
		bureaucracy. Our health system, I suggest, has been able to support
		professional service with lesser government interference than is
		the case for education.</p></li>
		<li><p align="justify" style="orphans: 2; margin-bottom: 0in; widows: 2; line-height: 100%">
		Vision:
		compared to   my arrival on PEI fifty years ago, PEI education
		documents indicate a narrowing view of education; in fact  it seems
		that the Department now views going to school and getting an
		education as one and the same. Not so says the World Bank, a large
		funder of public education throughout the developing world.  
		</p></li>
		<li><p align="justify" style="orphans: 2; margin-bottom: 0in; widows: 2; line-height: 100%">
		Professional
		Autonomy:
		 the OECD (who gives us PISA tests)  tell us that students in
		schools where the school has autonomy for a school’s day to day
		operation, do better on PISA tests than olther students. Informal
		evidence suggest that neither  principals nor teachers in PEI have
		much freedom even in professional matters.</p></li>
		<li><p align="justify" style="margin-right: 0.01in; orphans: 2; margin-bottom: 0in; widows: 2; line-height: 100%; background: #ffffff">
		Accountability:
		is a “duty to report (give account of) on events, tasks and
		experiences.  The education task task is to help Islanders gain
		skills, knowledge and attitudes of value to their and our futures.
		Reporting, however. Is mostly about the operation of schools.  
		</p></li>
		<li><p align="justify" style="margin-right: 0.01in; orphans: 2; margin-bottom: 0in; widows: 2; line-height: 100%; background: #ffffff">
		Culture:
		Although not widely mentioned, “the fear factor” is alive and
		well on PEI.  In fact it has It’s come up in discussions in
		recent days.  To paraphrase one administrator “anyone who plan to
		live and teach on PEI will not speak openly about desiring change”
		.  Some time ago, one small businessowner declined an invitation to
		participate in an education activity because he “gets small
		contracts  with the Province.”</p></li>
		<li><p align="justify" style="margin-right: 0.01in; orphans: 2; margin-bottom: 0in; widows: 2; line-height: 100%; background: #ffffff">
		Product
		or service:
		Dictionaries that I consult consider education to be a service to
		people who want/need to learn.  My sense of what’s happening,
		however, is that instead, education has become a product. As a
		result, much of focus is on years, days hours of schooling,
		credits, courses, diplomas and degrees.  Employers use degrees and
		diplomas as a screening device. Credentialling may be likened to a
		huge Board game.  In the word of one writer, employment does not
		require degrees but employers do.</p></li>
		<li><p align="justify" style="margin-right: 0.01in; orphans: 2; margin-bottom: 0in; widows: 2; line-height: 100%; background: #ffffff">
		Work
		ready education for employment – public educators have not been
		active supporters of technical and vocational education; leadership
		in education for work rested with the government of Canada. 
		Unfortunately, the federal government has vacated, or been squeezed
		out of its leadership role.

		Colleagues
		often said, training for employment is not valuedUnfortunately,
		however, the Federal government has vacated the leadership role and
		simply transfers money to the Provinces.  The change is now being
		felt. Still encounter Islanders who decry the loss of PVI and PCVHS
		as training grounds for business entrepreneurs</p></li>
