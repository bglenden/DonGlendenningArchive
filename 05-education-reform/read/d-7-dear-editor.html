  D-7 Dear Editor
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">A comprehensive synthesis of Don&#x27;s education concerns, based on discussions with Islanders, personal experience, and international research. He identifies three core problems: (1) Structural—confusing education with schooling, a problem the World Bank identified in developing countries but which applies to PEI; (2) Definitional—difficulty finding education definitions in Department literature or school websites; (3) Organizational—services organized by age rather than by educational functions (essential skills, citizenship values, employment skills, social graces). He argues the Department should lead public discussion on education&#x27;s purpose, services, and standards through an &quot;education plan.&quot; He contrasts having a &quot;school system&quot; with needing an &quot;education system.&quot; Contact: 902-892-5859.</div>

<p>Dear Editor: D-7</p>
<p>About Education</p>
<p>PEI needs a public conversation about education; I say this based on discussions with Islanders, my own experiences and what’s happening in education elsewhere. While I write about PEI, my views reflect the Canadian education scene and likely other countries as well. Let me explain.</p>
<p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Education has a structural problem; a World Bank Report in 2018 cautioned developing countries about treating education and “going to school” as though they are one and the same. We are doing that in PEI. It is interesting that we do not similarly confuse health care and hospitalization.</p>
<p>Then there is the matter of definition. While I am not an IT expert, my search of Department literature, school websites, failed to unearth a definition; a definition, even if others do not agree, is an important contributor to clear communication.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The main cause of confusion, however, is the prevailing practice of organizing services around age groups served<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>rather than functions performed. Education is process, a process of helping others gain essential skills, citizenship values, employment skills social graces, raising one’s general level of education to mention a few. These are the purposes for which we operate schools; that’s where the system should focus. These become the functional divisions of the Department. The Minister, and the system, need regular access to this kind of advice more so than advice on running schools.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The literature tells me that education benefits from community engagement.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Based on this, I’d like to see the Department of Education invite public discussion on education, what it is, who it serves, services offered and standards – an education plan so to speak. With an updaed plan, we could discuss the appropriate organization.</p>
<p>We have a school system; we should have an education an education. Let’s start the change process now.</p>
<p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Sincerely</p>
