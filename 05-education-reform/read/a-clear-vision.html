  A clear vision
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Dated October-December 2014, this letter responds to the Chamber of Commerce&#x27;s call for &quot;a clear vision&quot; in education. Don notes PEI has a published Philosophy of Education but identifies two critical limitations: it addresses only youth education, not lifelong learning, and it focuses narrowly on schooling rather than recognizing learning in homes, workplaces, and communities. He invokes John Dewey&#x27;s principle that understanding an organization&#x27;s philosophy reveals its essence, arguing that education policy requires comprehensive rethinking to encompass all citizens and learning settings.</div>

<p>October December 7, 2014</p>
<p>Editor, Charlottetown Guardian</p>
<p>Charlottetown, PEI	</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Dear Sir:</p>
<p>A clear vision</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The recent presentation by the Greater Charlottetown Area Chamber of Commerce to the Standing Committee on Education called for “a clear vision” as the first step in improving education in PEI; because the question had also come up on a number of conversations with members of the public, I decided to browse the PEI Government website to see what I could find.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Sure enough, I found a “Philosophy of Education”; not all Provinces are as well served; I urge readers to take a look. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>On examination, however, I find the statement has two limitations.</p>
<p><br></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li1">It deals only with the education of youth – but education is a life- long activity for all.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I looked for a statement of philosophy about education for the rest of us; it may exist but I was unable to find one.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If all citizens are not included in the statement of philosophy, they are also likely to be left out of the services that follow.</li>
  <li class="li1">Education is more than schooling; some of our most important learning experiences occur at home, at work and in the community at large.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>At the moment, our credit system counts only the experiences that occur in school.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Perhaps it’s time for a new credit system, one that counts educational experiences wherever and whenever they occur.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p>John Dewey once said that if he could only know one thing about a person, he would want to know that person’s philosophy; we can probably say the same about an organization.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Until we have a clear, thoughtful, overarching statement about education, including schools, we can expect little in the way of real improvement in in our school system.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Don Glendenning</p>
<p>A long time student of education</p>
