<p><b>EDUCATION 20/20 INC. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b>Form T2050 (E) – Application to register a Charity</b></p>
<p><b>Question 11a</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>To promote education and educational opportunity for every Canadian</b></p>
<p>Education is the issue of the day; our individual futures as well as the future of our community depends to a large degree, on the quality of our education system.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>More of the same is not the answer; the technology revolution, changed labour market conditions and requirements, globalization, opportunities for self-study, need for entrepreneurs demand significant changes in our education system.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Education 20/20 will (1) provide information to the general public through a newsletter, occasional papers, news and social media, and public presentations on a broad range of educational items, and (2) convene groups in local communities and provide facilitators to aid in the discussion.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We want people to be as comfortable and knowledgeable about family education as they are about their health.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Based on discussions to date, our initial focus will be on such underserved areas as Early Childhood Development (Preschool), credit for independent learning, basic literacy skills, consumer information, and the arts. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><b>Improve public understanding of the education system<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p>Education 20020 Inc. will become a catalyst for change by bringing stakeholders together to exchange information and ideas, identify challenges, seek new solutions, and generally work together for the betterment of our communities.</p>
<p><b>To exercise leadership in the improvement in all facets of education<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p>During the past few weeks we have been meeting with interested groups, including parents, to identify some of their interests.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Early childhood education appeared as a top priority among the people consulted.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Based on this, we convened a workshop, led by practitioners, but attended by others as well including parents, faculty members from the local university, and other interested citizens.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We plan to repeat this activity in other parts of the Province and with other subjects of interest including reading skills, challenge for credit, on-line courses and the most recent matter of skill shortages and available training.</p>
<p><b>To foster cooperation between and among all stakeholders</b></p>
<p>A quality education results from the efforts of many teachers, with the family and the school being most prominent; evidence supports the view that a high level engagement in education results in improved student performance. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In view of this, Education 20/20 will organize a variety of meetings, workshops, presentations and discussion groups in a variety of combinations.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Directors, and committees will include people from all walks of life who meet for the purpose of improving the quality of education for every Canadian and we will seek partnerships whenever possible. We will also offer an award annually to a school that best demonstrates engagement in its every day activities.</p>
<p><b>Undertake and support research and innovation<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p>We will work with all providers to encourage innovation and identify needs for further research, host meetings of researchers and innovators, include information about research and innovations in our newsletters and reports, and seek funds to support both research and innovation in and about our schools, identify innovators,<b> </b>arrange for innovators to meet other innovators, provide<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>a mechanism for innovators to keep in touch, publicize their accomplishments, arrange for them to share their experiences with others.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
