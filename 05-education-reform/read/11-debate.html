  11 Debate
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Don celebrates the increasing public debate about education and calls for continued coverage of educational issues equivalent to business and sports reporting. He responds to specific articles about reading requirements and school responsibility for work preparation, noting that PEI Department of Education literature lacks clear statements about required reading achievement or work-preparation roles. Emphasizes that clear, unequivocal statements from school systems about their purposes and responsibilities would provide necessary direction. Calls for Guardian to publish a full page of responses from students, parents, and citizens about educational expectations. Illustrates his belief in transparency, clear communication, and public dialogue as mechanisms for educational improvement and accountability.</div>

<p>Charlottetown, PEI</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Dear Editor:</p>
<p>Debate</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I am delighted to see an increasing debate about educational issues and look forward to the day when</p>
<p>articles about education take as much space in the paper as articles about businesses or sports.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Following the piece by Lloyd McKenna ('That all children may read', The Guardian, Nov. 9, 1998) I went</p>
<p>through my documents from the P.E.l. Department of Education to see if "being able to read" was a</p>
<p>requirement for graduation, or even for moving from elementary school to high school. While I admit</p>
<p>that my documents are out of date, no where did I find a statement about required achievement in</p>
<p>reading. A clear unequivocal statement on required reading achievement would serve a useful purpose</p>
<p>in setting direction for our schools.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Leo Broderick's article ('Who are we teaching, anyway?' Guardian, Nov. 21,, L998) raises a very</p>
<p>important issue. Does the school system have a responsibility to help young people prepare for work?</p>
<p>Secondary schools appear to be saying "no", unless a student is going to university first. But it is not</p>
<p>clear. My literature from the P.E.l. Department of Education, or from other provinces, is fuzzy on the</p>
<p>issue. Again, we need a clear statement to give direction.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I hope that an early issue of the Guardian will include an entire page of responses to these issues, and to</p>
<p>others which are likely to arise. lt would be especially interesting to hear from students and parents as</p>
<p>to what they expect from schools.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Don Glendenning,</p>
