  D 2014 An insight into schooling
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Published January 25, 2014, this analytical letter deconstructs the school system&#x27;s structural characteristics and limitations. Don identifies three school functions: skill development for societal participation, workforce development, and childcare. He notes that schools control curriculum delivery for all students over 12 years regardless of progress, offer limited accountability mechanisms, and operate without market incentives for improvement. The letter reveals his systems analysis approach and conviction that structural reforms (not just professional development or technology upgrades) are necessary for meaningful change.</div>

<p>Dear Sir:</p>
<p><b>An insight into the operation of the school system<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>To deal effectively with our math concerns, we<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>first need to deal with the following questions:</p>
<p>Why do we want our schools to do?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It seems that they have three functions: (1) to help students gain the skills they need to function in, contribute to and enjoy the society the live in (2) to help the Province and country develop the people it needs to participate in a global economy. (3) Provide care for young people while parents work. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>What math skills are needed? Ask students, Ask the community, Ask employers. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>We need a clear statement to this effect or a different</p>
<p>Through our agent,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>students, our government, we establish and fund schools to provide specialized help to young people in gaining or improving skills needed throughout life. mathematics is included among the skills we fund.</p>
<p>Schools deliver instruction in mathematics to every student for 12 years; students are not allowed to finish early and receive credit; nor can they het help for a few extra days to get caught u.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>I’ve not found any evidence of minimum levels of performance required to receive a diploma.</p>
<p>Students, parents and taxpayers generally have very limited recourse if they are not satisfied with the results; they cannot change teachers, change schools, stop payment,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The school system defies all normal market conditions; governments require students to attend, decides what will be taught, by whom, where and for how long; it licenses teachers; then employs them text books <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As a result, there is no reason or incentive<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>to do better.</p>
<p>Withdraw services, seek another supplier, become more effective or efficient.</p>
<p>Because the government is also the employer, and governors are politicians, even small incident becomes a political issue and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Fail to separate what will be taught from how it will be taught.roles and functions, Teachers appear to believe that they decided</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
