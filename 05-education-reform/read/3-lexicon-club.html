  3 Lexicon Club
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Open Education No. 66 (July 2018), authored by Don Glendenning introducing the &quot;Lexicon Club&quot;—an imagined community of education stakeholders who communicate precisely about education. Members understand distinctions between schooling and education, learners and students, instruction and education, credentials and qualifications. The article describes the club&#x27;s jurisdiction extending across Don&#x27;s farm north of Finnegan&#x27;s Brook and supporting education quality improvements across Canada. The Souris Study findings are reported (surveying continuing education needs), and the century-long history of federal education support is acknowledged. The piece reflects Don&#x27;s commitment to precise language as essential to education reform and documents ongoing research initiatives.</div>

<p><b>LEXICON CLUB</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>If you are reading this newsletter, you are likely eligible for membership in the Lexicon Club; in fact, you may already be a member. I live on PEI in Canada’s smallest Province, and know that there are thousands here who are eligible for membership. I’ve met and enjoyed conversations with many of them.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Many, however, would not qualify for membership and are destined to trudge the learning path alone</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The LEXICON CLUB is for people who communicate clearly about education, people who differentiate between schooling and education, who know the difference between<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>learner and<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>student or instruction<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>and education, and even between credential and qualification. They probably are good at crossword puzzles and DACUM analysis, but that is not a requirement for membership.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The Club is fully incorporated into my thinking, applies s legal on all pats of my farm north of Finnegan’s Brook.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The LEXICON Club supports initiatives to improve the quality of education any where in Canada.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Donations to Education 20/20,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>a charitable organizations will issue receipts for $10.00 or more in support of its work, has d has arranged with <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Education 20/20 Inc. to accept donations and carry out activities in support of education In PEI.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>All donors of $10.00 or more will be added to our mailing list</p>

<p><b>SOURIS STUDY</b></p>
<p>Education 20/20 is undertaking a survey of needs for continuing education in the Souris area of PEI.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The study will include a review of current offerings and capacity, interests and needs for further training as viewed by residents, employers and the community at large.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The final report will include a strategy for the future.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The study is being funded by <span>the Department of Workforce and Advanced Learning through the Canada-PEI labour Market Agreements."</span></p>

<p><b>A CENTURY OF FEDERAL SUPPORT</b></p>
<p>Among readers who responded to last month’s newsletter was Dr. Austen Bowman who, some of you may remember, was Director of the Federally funded PEI Newstart Corporation located in Montague, PEI.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We were also pleased to hear from Rupert Murdoch who was part of the major expansion in secondary technical and vocational programs in Ontario in the 1960’s.</p>
