  D-Clarity D  -
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">This is an extended draft/revision containing multiple versions of Don&#x27;s call for conceptual clarity in education. The core argument: education and schooling are fundamentally different concepts (education is a service; school is a place). World Bank guidance supports this distinction. Don critiques the Education Act&#x27;s elimination of an education definition in favor of a schooling definition, signaling institutional narrowing. He analyzes departmental literature, organizational structures, and terminology choices. The document includes repeated sections addressing departmental reorganization, the misalignment between government structure and educational services, and specific recommendations for defining key terms (education, school, student). His recommendation: the department should reestablish itself as &quot;Department of Education&quot; and publish clear definitions as &quot;Step One&quot; in education improvement.</div>

<p>Dear Editor</p>
<p><b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>CALL FOR CLARITY</b></p>
<p>											</p>
<p>Some time ago, I set out to explore public education with a view to increasing my knowledge and understandings. Education is complex; information plays a key role.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Learners have different interests, experiences, capabilities and needs; they also fill a variety of life roles and learn at their own pace.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The chief cause of confusion, I find, comes from the tendency to use education and schooling interchangeably. In a report in 2018, the World Bank reminded us that education and going to school are not the same. We should listen to the world Bank. Education is a service; school is a place. Experiences in school are major contributors to one’s education but so too are experiences at home, in our communities and through travel. In other words,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I sought definition of education.; I browsed Department literature, agendas and minutes of various education groups; lack of success may be more a<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>reflection of my IT level than Department policy). But the bottom line is that the Education Act no longer includes a definition of education. Instead I found a hybrid definition of schooling” intended to cover the education function.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Altthough needed <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>changes are many, I believe in the inevitability off gradualness. my recommendation is simple. The Department reestablish itself as a Department of Education an post definitions for a few key words: education, school,student,etc. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>	y</p>
<p>I considerthist Step One in the education improvement process; step 2 and three will come in future letters.</p>
<p>Sincerely</p>

<p>Thw Department plays a key leadership role in providing public education services. The Department needs a definition and it should be widely available to both the education community at large. Whether I agree wih it is quite a separate issue.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Didwould define it; my view is that in a Department as divers as Education, there should be I searched reports, agendas, minutes and oher documents without success. Si I searched the Department literature and foundBut I had trouble finding a PEI working definition</p>
<p>Lack of clarity must be addressed directly so that the concept of education won’t become diluted; We can all contribute to the change process.</p>
<p>Sincerely</p>

<p>•	Governments usually structure around branches or fields. PEI Agriculture lists its divisions as land, water, crops, animals, etc. Health is organized around primary care, drugs, Covid, hospitals, etc. Education should also be organized around fields. life roles or services but, instead, is organized around the running<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>of schools. The focus should be on helping people learn rather than running schools in which they learn.</p>
<p>•	The PEI Department uses<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Education and Lifelong Learning” in title; doesn’t education include lifelong learning?</p>
<p>•	Documents refer to helping young people “secure a place” in society; what do we mean by<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“a<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>place”?; what criteria would one use to assess progress?</p>
<p>•	The Department refers to its goal as one of “developing and delivering programs”; the literature refers to education as a service of helping people gain “skills, knowledge and attitudes needed to thrive in future years?</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The conclusions that follow are based on my own experience, exploration of literature, agendas and minutes, conversations, school websites, education associations and partnership.</p>
<p>Conceptual clarity is a must to understand the people we serve, the services we provide, learner needs, product, processes and values especially when the subject carries layers of subjectivity</p>
<p>October 20,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>2023</p>
<p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>As a frequent participant in conversations about education, I am struck by the absence of definitions and boundaries; communication and understanding may suffer as a result.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The Dictionary of Education (Good) defines definition as “the process of determining the definition or meaning of a word, idea or proposition in general and within a given context; the process of assigning meaning enhances both precision and clarity.”</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>. Those who teach, or other-wise serve learners, must be very clear in their communication</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>. Conceptual clarity heightens our understanding of key words and concepts;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Lack of clarity may arise from an idea itself, from the person promoting the idea or from the person receiving the idea; Lack of clarity could also signal conflicting ideas and levels of discomfort or disagreement from within the education family group itself.<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Conceptual clarify is also a must in planning and assessing performance.</p>
