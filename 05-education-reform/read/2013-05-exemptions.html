  2013-05 Exemptions
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Supporting Keith Hogg&#x27;s suggestion that high school students successfully challenge examinations could be exempted from taking courses, Don recalls similar exemption policies during his university studies. Exemptions would free students to concentrate on challenging subjects, explore new interests, or graduate early, eliminating wasted time re-learning previously covered material. Don identifies only positive impacts (student motivation, personalized pacing, exposure to new learning) and no downsides. He frames this as a practical incentive encouraging student achievement.</div>

<p>Dear Sir:</p>
<p><b>High School Exemptions</b></p>
<p>Keith Hogg made the suggestion (‘Exams fail to prepare students for the workforce’, The Guardian, March 7, 2013) that high school students be allowed to write exams and, if successful, be exempt from taking the courses.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It makes sense and would be a real incentive to students.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I’ve had it happen twice during my university studies but I’ve also sat through courses where the material had already been covered in an earlier course or by another teacher; there was nothing wrong with the material, it was just that it was a repeat. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Under an exemption policy, students could spend more time on subjects where help is needed, study a different subject, or even finish early.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There are so many new and exciting things to learn, it’s a shame to think that students must spend valuable school hours listening to things they already know. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>What would the impact of an exemption policy be on learners and learning?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>All positive, I would venture.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Is there a downside?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I can’t think of any; at the least, it is worth a try. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Let your school trustee know that you agree with Keith, and let me know what you think at <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>HYPERLINK "mailto:standards2020@gmail.com" <span>standards2020@gmail.com</span><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
