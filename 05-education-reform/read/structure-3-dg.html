  Structure 3-DG
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Policy document addressing structural education reform, arguing that education needs a clear and compelling vision focused on general human development rather than knowledge delivery. Recommends adoption of competencies as basis for curriculum, decentralization of service delivery with professional autonomy, and learning assessment based on demonstrated performance rather than testing alone.</div>

	An organization’s structure outlines
	how activities are to be directed to achieve goals, roles and
	responsibilities. Typical education services usually include:
	governance, instruction, assessment, products and technology,
	information and counselling, human resources, administration and
	finance; typically leaders or directors of key services form the
	management team.  While organizations may take many forms, service
	organizations, like education, are usually decentralized giving
	members freedom to respond to individual and local demands. 
	</p>
	<p style="margin-left: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
	It is the writer’s view that the view
	of educators and the views of the public have diverged in recent
	years; the view of public educators has narrowed in recent years,
	that it is focused on knowledge, achieved through institutions, and
	that both quality and quantity are marked by courses and years,
	majors, diplomas and degrees. the public appears more focused on
	general development.</p>
	<p style="margin-left: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
	 Based on my exploration of public
	education and experience, I believe that public education needs an
	overhaul starting with: 
	</p>
	<p style="margin-left: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
	1.	A “clear and compelling” vision -
	although much has been written about education, a comprehensive
	vision statement does not seem to exist for PEI; the pr0cess of
	developing such a statement is needed to refocus on education,
	clarify direction and regenerate engagement. Current documents are
	vague and may even be misleading; they fall far short of setting a
	direction foor education services needed n the 21st century. Current
	documents lack clarity, leaves the impression that education is for
	the young,  is achieved by going to school, and is marked by grades,
	years, diplomas and degrees</p>
	<p style="margin-left: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
	2.	 Adoption of competencies as a basis
	for program planning and curriculum development, individual profiles
	and tracking student progress</p>
	<p style="margin-left: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
	3.	Education is a service, a service of
	helping others change the way they think,; feel or act. They apply
	whether dealing with one or 1,000 learners. Embedding services in
	government and delivering through schools misses many who could use
	help. Successful service organizations decentralize ; Successful
	service organizations require professional workers to have
	significant levels autonomy. In act, the OECD tells us that students
	from schools with autonomy for their day to day operation show
	better PISA results</p>
	<p style="margin-left: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
	•	Lerner achievement should be based
	on demonstrated student performance, nott just tet taking, and
	should include student self rating.</p>
	<p style="margin-left: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
	•	Given the importance of parents in
	the education process, it may be time for the Department to become
	more active in publishing informationRoles and accountabilities are
	not clear  
	</p>
	<p style="margin-left: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
	•	Organization of health services are
	an interesting alternative.</p>
	<p style="margin-left: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
	•	Schools should be largely
	accountable for their day-to-day operation</p>
