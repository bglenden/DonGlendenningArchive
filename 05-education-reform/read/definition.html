  Definition
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Drawing on World Bank guidance, Don explains the education-vs.-schooling distinction. Education is an umbrella concept encompassing all learning—at home, in school, through travel, self-exploration. School/schooling refers to physical facilities and institutional settings. COVID accelerated this distinction by expanding home-based and independent learning. Don again notes his unsuccessful search for the Department of Education&#x27;s definition of education in official documents. Upon inquiry, he learned the definition was replaced with &quot;school&quot; in the Education Act. He questions whether this applies to all schools or only public ones, and argues such a significant change deserves public discussion. The letter emphasizes that clear definitions enhance communication and mutual understanding.</div>

<p>Dear Editor:</p>
<p>Clarity</p>
<p>Some time ago The World Bank cautioned developing countries about confusing education and schooling; I’m afraid we do that too.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Education is an umbrella word that includes all kinds of learning whenever and wherever it comes about – at home, in school, through travel and self-exploration. School and schooling, on the other hand, refers to a building or room set aside and equipped to learning and teaching. Recent years, thanks to Covid, have brought about a significant increase in the number of home based and independent learners.</p>
<p>A couple of weeks ago I went looking for the definition of “education” used by the Department of Education; couldn’t find it. (IT is not a personal strength)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I couldn’t even find the definition in the Education Act.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>On enquiry, learned that the definition of “education” had been replaced in the Act by a definition of “school”. Not sure if this applies to all schools or only to public schools</p>
<p>Definitions are crucial to the clarity of communication Seems to me that a change of this magnitude deserves some public discussion.</p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
<p>Don Glendenning</p>
