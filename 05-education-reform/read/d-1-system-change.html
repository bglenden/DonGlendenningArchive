	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Preparation
	for life’s roles is called education and the better prepared we
	are the better we are able to cope with all that we encounter, or
	create.  Educating is a complex matter made so by the unique
	characteristics of each person served.  Each person is unique in
	many ways, unique in basic physical, mental, emotional make-up;
	unique in the range and nature of previous experience, unique in
	perceived futures, but also unique in terms of learning pace, style
	and needs.  Education is often described as any experience that has
	a formative effect on the way we think, feel or act; it may also the
	thought of as what we can do with what we have learned.</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">It
	is widely recognized that education is a key factor in determining
	each citizen’s quality of life; in the same way, the collective
	education of our citizens will determine to a significant degree the
	quality of the community in which we live.  In recognition of its
	importance, governments provide massive support for public
	education; the investment is justified for two reasons, one to
	ensure a high level of personal growth and development for every
	citizen; the other is to ensure the common good. 
	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">There
	is a gap between what Islanders have and what they want in the way
	of education.  Indicators of the gap include: the limited engagement
	between educators and the community they serve; the lack of a
	philosophy of education that encompasses all our citizens;
	government’s focus on the young and schooling; service gaps such
	as the availability of independent information on which to make
	educational choices; availability of part time instruction; lack of
	market conditions normal for a sector; politicization of decision
	making and limits on professional autonomy and accountability.
	Citizens see most of the issues as organizational, created by
	government decision-makers and, therefore, capable of being changed
	by those same government decision-makers.

	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">To
	close the gap between what Islanders want and what the Province
	provides; Education 20/20 Inc. recommends that:</p>

	</p>
	<ol>
		<li><p style="orphans: 2; margin-bottom: 0in; widows: 2; line-height: 100%">
		As
		an immediate step, Government engage in the development of a short,
		clear, overarching, public statement about education, who it is
		intended to serve, its guiding principles and basic beliefs. 
		Although much has been written about education, a comprehensive
		vision statement does not currently exist for PEI. We believe that
		having such a statement is required, especially for a service as
		large and complex as education, however, we are not suggesting
		another study but rather a document prepared by a small working
		with opportunity for citizen input.</p></li>

	</p>
	<ol start="2">
		<li><p style="orphans: 2; margin-bottom: 0in; widows: 2; line-height: 100%">
		Develop
		a learner centered service model that provides support in all
		domains to learners as, when and where needed.  Doing so would
		involve student centered outcomes, criterion referenced assessment,
		flexible scheduling, challenge for credit arrangements, and greater
		autonomy and accountability for teachers. 
		</p></li>
		<li><p style="orphans: 2; margin-bottom: 0in; widows: 2; line-height: 100%">
		Government
		reserve for itself a leadership role in creating a learning culture
		and providing a quality education for every Islander.  Such a role
		is important but currently lacking, and education suffers as a
		result. Government should  focus on matters of planning, setting
		priorities, funding, monitoring, quality control, ensuring the
		availability of professional resources, home support for preschool
		children,  information and continuing education. Under such an
		arrangement, the Department may well play an increased role in
		delivering support to families with pre- school children, more
		active role in promoting and offering continuing education classes
		and even in providing information and services to children and
		their parents.</p></li>

	<ol start="5">

		Establish a
		qualification authority, a separate body for the purpose certifying
		individual levels of achievement to persons wanting or needing such
		documentation.  The role of teaching is to help others learn; when
		a teachers rank their students they are putting their ability to
		teach at risk; assigning student grades, selecting students for
		prizes and awards and awarding diplomas and degrees is a sorting
		process and should not be part of a teacher’s role. 
		Apprenticeship with certification through a Provincial Department
		of Labour and music through the Royal Canadian Music Conservatory
		are examples of a preferred arrangement.

		Take

		a family education adviser for those who want it, and professional
		autonomy and accountability for all.</p></li>
