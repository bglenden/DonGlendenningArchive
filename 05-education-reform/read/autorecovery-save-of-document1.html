<p><b>About</b></p>
<p><b>Education</b></p>
<p><b>Why?</b></p>
<p><b>Welcome to About Education!</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>No doubt you are wondering why I’m writing this newsletter; the answer is simple. I<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>believe education to be important. It was important to me; I believe it is important to other readers and to the community at large. What we are allowed to do and what we are encouraged to<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>learn as pat of our education, is and will continue to be influenced to a significant degree by the nature and extent of our individual and collective education.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>I’ve spent my life in formal education, first as a student, later<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>as a teacher and always as an independent learner.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Education has much to offer; it has been good to me and good for me. But I think the view as to what constitutes education has narrowed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>So, what is education anyway? There are a number of ways to respond; here are three:</b></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li1"><b>A person’s education consists of experiences that have had a measurable effect on the way a person thinks, feels and acts.</b></li>
  <li class="li1"><b>A person’s level of education reflects the extent to which they are able to cope with circumstances that confront them in their daily lives<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></li>
  <li class="li1"><b>A good education, presumably, is one that prepares one to cope and thrive at a reasonable level in ones various life roles.</b></li>
  <li class="li1"><b>An education system is a system of services put in place by a community to support the education of its citizens. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></li>
</ul>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Another reason for writing is the belief that the meaning of education is not well understood. Te World Bank, for example, cautioned<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>member countries about confusing education with going to<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>school. (World Bank, Report on Education 2019). The PEI Department of Education seems to have fallen into the same trap when it continues to refer to its role as serving young people through “developing and delivering<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>programs and curriculum”. Our experiences in school are important but in no wy should we consider successful shool studies as the measure of our education.</b></p>
