  21-2-D  RESTRUCTURING
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Another restructuring draft emphasizing education&#x27;s provincial responsibility and various service components (governance, funding, instruction, human resources, products, technology, quality assurance, counseling). Don observes education deeply embedded in government more than other sectors. Identifies multiple structural impediments mentioned by trustees, international organizations, and educators. Outlines key issues: mission clarity, structural organization (hospital administration vs. principal models), accountability specification, autonomy, professional culture/collaboration, and instructional models including curriculum, teacher training, and assessment. Proposes legislative committee as appropriate reform vehicle.</div>

<p><b>RESTRUCTURING EDUCATION</b></p>
<p><b>21-2</b></p>

<p>Education is an umbrella word and includes all learning experiences wherever, whenever and however initiated, carried out and paid for. Education may be self-initiated or arranged by others. It is said that the most important part of ones educational experiences are those initiated through the home before we even start school. Although the education system focuses on traditional subjects of study my inclination is to focus on practices drawn from real life and considered essential.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Becoming more educated, results in changes in the way a person thinks, feels or acts.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Being educated has been described as” a state that allows a person to adequately cope with all demands of daily life”-Anon.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Education is a provincial responsibility; typical services usually include: governance and leadership, funding, instruction, human resources, products and technology, quality assurance and Information and counselling. Not unusual is the fact that a number of services are direct delivered by government itself. It seems to the writer, however, that education is more deeply and completely embedded in government than any other service or sector - .<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>It is the writer’s view that PEI needs to restructure its educational services. I first heard about structural impediments in the education system a few years ago from a PEI trustee. Then in 2011, the OECD recommended more autonomy to schools for their day- to- day operation as a way to improve PISA test results. in 2018, the World Bank, the largest funder of educational services, spoke about improving an education system by delegating certain operational practices to schools and intermediary bodies.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Montreal Economic Institute reported that autonomy and accountability<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“jointly applied” are key factors in school achievement”. and just a few weeks ago, a friend forwarded information from UNESCO about the structure of educational services.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And that’s not to forget a “Call for Action” by Education 2020 Inc. in 2015, newspaper items and the many comments from retired educators and Island citizens at large. And I’ve encountered the “fear factor’	</p>
<p>Issues:</p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li3">Mission</li>
  <li class="li3">Structure – hosp admin vs principal, chief education officer, whats to be done; who will do what</li>
  <li class="li3">Accountability not spelled out-government pay for</li>
  <li class="li3">Autonomy</li>
  <li class="li3">Culture-professional, union, collaborative, pei association, innovation,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>

<p>The problem. as I see it, is two- fold. (1) Government has adopted a narrow vision as to what constitutes education confusing it with school studies and (2) simply folded it into existing government<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>folded the bundle into a political body. confused it with running schools, and delivered it with military precision. We need to go back to the drawing board.</p>
<p>An overhaul is in order: seems like a perfect role for<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>the Legislative committee on Education.</p>

<p>. Many suggest that service is no longer the focus. students are simply looking for the piece of paper, the<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“pass”, the credit, diploma or degree.</p>
