  D In Defence of teachers
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Don defends teachers against widespread criticism, arguing that teachers are constrained by bureaucratic systems rather than inherently inferior. He catalogs restrictions: curriculum control, standardized testing schedules, prescribed texts, and undefined additional duties beyond teaching. He argues teachers are enveloped in &quot;a cocoon of bureaucracy&quot; that only employers and unions can change together, yet neither group demonstrates commitment to improvement. He advocates for professional development structures separate from union negotiations, as he observed in other provinces. This letter shows his empathy for teachers and focus on systemic constraints rather than individual blame.</div>

<p>Dear Sir:</p>
<p><b>In Defence of Teachers</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I was questioned recently about my support of teachers.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Although teachers bear the brunt of criticisms about schooling, as far as I am concerned, they are neither significantly better or worse at their jobs than any other occupational group. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I might be less lenient if:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>What, when and where they teach is controlled by their employer along with the texts to be used, testing schedule, content and nature of reports.</p>
<p>Their employer sets their entrance qualifications and certifies that they know how to teach, In addition to teaching, for which they trained and for which they were hired, teachers may be called on for playground duty, hall monitoring, fund raising and other duties. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>I’ve tried to locate a statemet of duties, a position description, so to speak but have not flound one yet.</p>
<p>It is likely that individual teachers have considerable control of how they<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>teach; this is determined, to a large degree by the nature and extent of their training.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>How long they have to teach it, however, is a different question in that it all must be squeezed into an instructional period less any interruptions by the administrative staff. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Individual teachers are enveloped in a cocoon of bureaucracy that can be changed, it appears, only when the employer and the union agree.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is no wonder that we have frustrated and burned out teachers, and that instruction suffers as a result.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I see little evidence that ether party supports improvement.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>While the teachers and thiir union could may support change, the responsibility for improvement rests with the employer.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Most Provinces operate on the same model and none seemed inclioned to ; it is difficult, therefore, for PEI to act alone. and other provincesAnd I see little evicence, if any, that are is little evidence that they areinitencouragesTeachers’ Federation agree. Both seem wedded to the status quo.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Neither seem ointerestedUntil teachers are given the freedom to teach, I’llof individual teachers cannot be opened from the inside but requires agreement by the employer and the Union. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I’d be happy to be corrected on the above, or any other of my views, and can<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>be reached at <span>at<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>HYPERLINK "mailto:standards2020@gmail.com" </span><span>standards2020@gmail.com</span><span><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p><br></p>
<p>As I understand it, teachers in some provinces are served by two organizations, one deals with employment matters and the other with their professional development.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That is not the case in PEI therefore every issue becomes a union issue.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As I reflect on my own professional development, I must say that I can attribute so much of my personal growth to professional associations to which I belonged.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>; any differences from the norm result, I believe from the structure that they work in; the bureaucracy frustrates them also. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I value my freedom to act. School teachers have very little.</p>
