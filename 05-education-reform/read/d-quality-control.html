  D Quality control  
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Don uses restaurant quality control as analogy: customers vote with feet, regulators enforce standards, poor performers lose licenses. He contrasts this with education, a monopoly system where students and parents have no recourse for poor service, cannot access alternative suppliers without paying twice, and have limited choice. Schools are not client-centered or consumer-friendly, yet funding is identical regardless of quality. He calls for quality monitoring and consumer protection mechanisms in education comparable to other sectors. The piece (though containing some rough drafting) illustrates his consumer-choice orientation.</div>

<p>Dear Sir:</p>
<p><b>Quality control</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>Recently my wife and I visited a new restaurant, at least one that was new to us.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The menu showed variety, prices were reasonable, the view was great.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We placed our order and waited for service; it didn’t come or at least did not come in a time frame we thought to be reasonable – so we went to an alternative restaurant nearby. On occasion restaurants lose their licenses because of unsafe practices in handling the food they serve; sometimes food is taken off grocery shelves when eating it would place our health at risk; children may be sent home from school where the radon count is high.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As individuals, we may take our business elsewhere when a product or service services does not meet expectations. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>There is no equivalent way for students and their parents to express dissatisfaction with educational service.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>First of all, schools are not client centered nor consumer friendly, you pay as much for poor service as for good, although students, in effect , are purchasing an educational service he or she has no one to turn to as an advocate.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>there is no the system is a monopoly – schools are the only franchise in town;<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>to find a private supplier means that youu pay twice,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>all schools purchase their materials from the same supplier, munu is the same for all regardless of your inerests or<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>preferences.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Students so the product in a neighbour school com and purchasing educational services elsewhere is expensive especially when you are paying twice for the same service; Choosing your school is not always possibleBeople who complain do so with some reluctance because f<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Neither the Department nor the School boards appear ro have a quaNo “consumers” union monitoring and reporting on quality.</p>
