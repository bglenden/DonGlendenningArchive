	the kinds of help learners found useful.  Following some informal
	discussion, an additional session was held on May 14 at the Haviland
	Club with about 35 participants present during which the Learning
	path was the focus of discussion.  Later ”A Learning Path” was
	posted on our website published as an occasional paper.  (Copy

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">While
still believing in their value, we have put the activity on hold
until we find additional resources.</p>

<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><b>C)
Employers</b></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">Exploration of the “preparedness
gap” continues.  We now chair a small group of representatives from
the Department of Education, the English Language School Board. The
community Foundation and employers to better define/describe the gap
and identify actions to be taken.  We anticipate the next significant
step to be the development of a skills map, a common master list of
skills from available to any interested party, teacher, student,
parent, employer to assist in the identification of what is to be
learned or taught.allow e

Supplemental educational services</b>

</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">While
we continue to recognize the importance of agencies, other than
schools, and include leaders of such services in our activities, as
of this date, we have taken no further steps to offer such services.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><br />

</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><b>E)
Assessment</b></p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0.14in">We
have continued our exploration of the role of assessment in the
education process and concluded that, while formative assessment is a
legitimate role for educational institutions, summative evaluation is
not.  Our activities to date have been exploratory in nature.  We
find, for example (1) at the international level, neither Canada nor
the USA have  “qualification authorities, (b) Canadian education
authorities tend to rely on input measures (what is taught, rather
than output measured (what has been learned) for purposes of
comparison and (3) there appears to be no widely recognised
graduation qualification available to providers and users alike. 2We
expect to become more active in the exploration of alternatives in
the months ahead.</p>

Creativity/Imagine Sessions</b></p>
<ol>
	<li><p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">To
	some extent, the charting of a learning path was an imagine
	activity; the initial session started with a few students, blank
	flip chart and the question “what kind of help do you want/need to
	support your learning?  Out of it came a number of discussions, a
	learning path and, at, east for the writer, a clearer understanding
	of the conflict that arises when teachers also grade.</p></li>
	<li><p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">We
	are currently holding informal exploratory discussions with our
	local University about a “greenfield” project for graduate
	students in which groups would be encouraged take on the design of
	an Early Childhood Centre for a small community, design a small high
	school for a community, design a continuing education or career
	education program for PEI.  Participants would be given a minimum
	set of criteria outlining safety and legal requirements and left to
	use their imagination as to a design.</p></li>
	<li><p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">We
	would like, however, to find a way to host small groups who may not
	want to take on a formal project but simply want to increase their
	understanding of the education enterprise.</p></li>

Handle with Care</b>

<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">– national
program who owns it, our role</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">Handle
with Care is a program designed to help parents and other caregivers
promote the mental health of young children every day!  It is useful
for everyone who cares for or works with children; especially
parents, grandparents and teachers, and consists of sets of
interactive strategies that build on the strengths of adults in their
lives.  The program is
based on four building blocks: Trust and Attachment, Building and
Enhancing Self- Esteem, Expressing Emotions and Building
Relationships with Others.  Each block builds upon the one before and
contains the following components: Key message, Research, Activities,
Bringing it Home and Bringing it together, other resources and a
Summary Handout.   The key to a successful program is trained
facilitators.  Appendix</p>
