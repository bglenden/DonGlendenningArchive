  2014 School and work
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Don identifies three components in the school-work debate: education should develop full capacities including work and life skills; disagreement exists on schools&#x27; role (public expects work skills, educators resist); and documentation problems (schools provide credentials describing what was taught, not qualifications describing what was learned). He proposes employers move beyond high school graduation to direct skills testing through an employer-operated service, allowing individuals to establish and document skill levels relevant to job requirements.</div>

<p>Dear Sir:</p>
<p><b>School and work<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>It seems to me that the issue of school and work has at least three components:</p>
<p>Most would agree, I think, that education should help a person to develop his or her full capacities including skills needed to make a living and those needed to enjoy the living that is made.</p>
<p>Although skills for work are part of one’s education, there is a major difference of opinion as to the role of schools in providing them; the public generally thinks schools should provide work skills; educators generally seem to think that is not a school role. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Schools cannot do everything, shouldn’t try to do everything, but their role needs to be clear.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>A third issue is that of documenting what has been learned.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Schools provide a credential describing what has been taught; the community, especially employers, want a document that describes what has been learned, or perhaps more precisely, whether the skills of the applicant include skills needed for the job. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Credentials do not provide that information</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>It appears that employer needs for this information are greater than school needs; if so, perhaps employers should drop high school graduation as a criterion for screening new employees and replace it with an “essential skills requirement.” Tools to measure essential skills are readily available; a testing service could be operated by employers themselves.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Individuals who need or want to establish their skill levels could apply, be tested and include the results along with an application.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>No doubt, results of the assessment would be of value to teachers as well.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
