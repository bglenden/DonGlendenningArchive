<div class="reader-summary">Dated November 21, 2013, Don draws parallels between culinary education&#x27;s evolution and needed educational transformation. He recalls PEI&#x27;s shift from quantity cooking (for institutional food service) to refined culinary arts with professional chefs, driven by changing market demands and entrepreneurial vision. He argues schools similarly need to evolve from delivering standardized content to fostering creative, rewarding learning experiences with teachers as skilled craftspeople. The letter reveals his belief that education, like the culinary sector, benefits from industry leadership, professional autonomy, and responsive innovation.</div>

<p>Dear Sir:</p>
<p><b>A Culinary Lesson<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p>The evolution of the culinary sector on PEI during the past 30 years is, I believe, instructive for education.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>I remember well the discussions around the establishment of the Culinary Insttute of Canada; they were exciting times but they were times of great learning.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And one of the lessons learned was the difference between the “quantity cooking” program then being offered and the culinary program envisaged.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We need to haave that conversation about education<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In 1969 lunch time for most Islanders were eaten at home; most restaurants were small and family operated.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Restaurant workers were mostly trained on the job, trained through short preseason extension courses and graduates of cooking courses offered by PVI and PCVHS.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The focus of the available training was “quantity cooking” and was intended for people employed in hospitals, school cafeterias and the ferries.</p>
<p>To draw a parallel, our schools sustem<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>was set up years ago to deliver a basic menu of course content to young people.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That’s mostly what we still do but we still use the same old boxes of subject heading, time slotsm<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>etc.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>it is time for a culinary model, to make education a creative and rewarding experience with teachers as chefs<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>including culinary demonstrations</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>provide an educational .<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Times have changed dramatically, much of the content does not have to be delivered by teachers<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>content is nokey content of large nI am reminded sometimes of that discussion when I hear comments about our current delivery model od education.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>model versus Sometimes the discussion about our educational delivery model But “times they were a changing”.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Pent up demands, new mobility, cash in hand</p>
<p>Increasing numbers of people were looking for seeking different kinds of food and considered eating out as an experience.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As a tourism destination, the Island needed to change. And people in the<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>industry led the change.</p>
<p>But education was also expanding and changing with the most noticeable being the emergence of community colleges with a new focus, that of providing educational services<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>to communities.</p>
<p>Interest in the industry increased; finally industry leaders decided to do something about it</p>
<p>Mandate and freedom Province had created a part of the infrastructure to respond and with freedom outside government Newly created Holland ollege</p>
