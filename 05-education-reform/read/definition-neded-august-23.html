  Definition neded August 23
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Don reiterates his core argument in September 2024: definitions are critical to clarity of communication, enabling clearer thinking, better understanding, and mistake-prevention. He was surprised to learn the Department of Education no longer defines &quot;education&quot;—the word was replaced with &quot;school&quot; during an Education Act amendment. This change may explain the narrowing of educational services offered by government. Don distinguishes clearly: education and school are different words with different meanings. He calls for a taxonomy of key terms to be created and widely circulated, emphasizing the importance of shared conceptual frameworks in policy discourse.</div>

<p>September 23, 2024</p>
<p>Dear Editor:</p>
<p><b>Definition needed</b></p>
<p>Definitions are critical to the clarity of communication; they help us to think through and communicate more clearly; they also help us to avoid misunderstanding.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>I was surprised, therefore, to learn recently that the Department of Education no longer has a definition of education. Apparently, the word “education” was replaced with “school” during an amendment of the Education Act.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This may explain the narrowing of educational services</p>
<p>Both education and school are perfectly good words but they have different meanings. A taxonomy of key terms is called for and should be widely circulated.</p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
<p>Don Glendenning.</p>
