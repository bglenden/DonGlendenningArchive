  D Life long learning

<div class="reader-summary">Based on extensive conversations across PEI about education, Don identifies reading as the most critical educational concern parents raise. He critiques BC&#x27;s appointment of a Superintendent of Reading as bureaucratic bloat rather than effective reform. Instead, he proposes making reading a distinct subject with assigned teachers, reporting on all levels, and developing common outcomes and assessment scales across all educators. He calls reading a &quot;vital sign&quot; of educational health and encourages public participation in education debate. This demonstrates his data-driven approach (gathering real concerns) and preference for structural clarity over administrative hierarchy.</div>

<p>Dear Sir</p>
<p><b>Same conclusions but different actions</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>My recent meanderings and discussions included reviewing some PEI education studies and cogitating on a recent item in the Vancouver Sun.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In particular, I am intrigued by the different actions triggered by the same set of facts.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Let me illustrate:</p>
<p><br></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li1">The Report on School Governance, issued earlier this year, addressed the issue of governance, partnerships, community involvement in reviewing and refining goals, standards, policies, etc.; anything I’ve read or heard supports that view. One would expect, therefore, a high level advisory body broadly representative of the community served including parents, employers, justice officials, and other community leaders.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>What the report recommends is a collaborative process with counsel coming primarily from people already in the education fold; people the Minister sees<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>and works with on a daily basis.</li>
  <li class="li1">The second was a report on the K-12 school proposed or Souris<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>reported on the need for the Minister</li>
  <li class="li1">The performance of students in British Columbia has been disappointing; the state of reading in PEI, although receiving considerable attention, is still of great concern to parents; I’ve encountered a number of parents and grandparents of children having difficulty in reading.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>(Based on my conversations, however, I sometimes think that the real problem is with teachers having difficulty with teaching) <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If the BC objective is to improve reading, instead of a Superintendent of Reading, one might expect such measures as<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>allocating more time to the subject, designating teachers of reading, better training of teachers, more indivudualized tutring, earlier detection. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li1"> <span class="Apple-converted-space">     </span></li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p>consider myself a life=long learnerlearned something about myself recentlyDuring the past few months I have discussed education with people from Tignish to Souris, many points in between, and even while visiting friends and family in New Brunswick.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There are many concerns about education, but the example raised most often is that of reading, sometimes known as “the golden skill”. I consider reading ability a vital sign of health for the educational journey.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I am aware of efforts by Provinces, including our own, to address the issue and understand that levels are improving.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I was interested, therefore, to learn recently that British Columbia has appointed a Superintendent of Reading and, furthermore, that the National Reading Campaign is recommending that other provinces do the same. <span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>While I applaud renewed focus on the subject, I doubt that adding to the bureaucracy will do much to help.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Let me offer a couple of different suggestions.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Without doubt, more support and encouragement should be offered to learners in and through the home.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As for the school system, since reading is such an essential skill,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I’d like to see it identified as a separate subject, teachers assigned to teach it, and performance in reading be included on report cards at all levels.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I’d also like to see a common set of reading outcomes or competencies and a common rating scale to be used by all who teach and tutor readers – a reading “hymnbook”..</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Please do your part and enter the debate; it is a vital step towards reading Improvement and your comments are welcome at standards2020@gmail.com. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
