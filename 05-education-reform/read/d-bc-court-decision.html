  D BC Court decision  
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Don discusses a British Columbia Court of Appeal decision that removed restrictions on class size and staffing patterns, noting that such flexibility should reduce teacher stress and encourage innovation. He cites examples of schools that improved dramatically through non-traditional approaches: one Michigan school operated without a principal, and an Arizona school improved rankings by adding teaching assistants rather than reducing class size. He notes the BCTF appeal to the Supreme Court and suggests that if upheld, the decision could apply nationally. The letter shows his interest in evidence-based alternatives to conventional educational structures and his recognition that flexibility in staffing patterns enables innovation.</div>

<p>Editor,</p>

<p>Dear Sir:</p>
<p><b>BC Court Decision</b></p>
<p>During the recent sitting of the Legislature earlier this year, there was considerable discussion about class size and composition.</p>
<p>Readers may know that a recent a decision by the BC Court of Appeal removes some of the restrictions on class size and staffing patterns in BC schools; those changes alone, it seems, should reduce teacher stress and encourage innovation in schools, innovations like the one in Michigan where a school decided to operate without a principal and another I visited once in Arizona where school ranking dramatically improved by adding a half dozen teaching assistants.</p>
<p>BCTF is appealing the decision to the Supreme Court; if the decision is upheld I assume that it will apply to all provinces.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p><br></p>
