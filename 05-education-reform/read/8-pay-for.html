<div class="reader-summary">Open Education No. 87 (April 26, 2020). Don discusses evolving performance-based rating systems that assess student performance by accuracy, consistency, fluency, and self-confidence rather than traditional grades. Includes profile of Bishop Carroll High School&#x27;s self-directed learning model as exemplar. Reflects his advocacy for competency-based assessment and student-centered learning approaches.</div>

<p>Student performance</p>
<p>Rating student performance is changing; disappearing are the large testing rooms filled with students agitatedly taking tests.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Performance may be tested any<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>time and results are often the subject of discussion between student and teacher, and may not even be recorded<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>separately but simply integrated into a rating <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>session of skills currently being learned.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Some rating scales try to replicate criteria used in real life.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Differences in performance on any skill are thought to result from the degree to which a learner performs with:</p>
<p>•	Accuracy</p>
<p>•	Consistency</p>
<p>•	With or without assistance</p>
<p>•	In allotted time</p>
<p>•	Fluency in math facts</p>
<p>•	When complications arise</p>
<p>•	Self-confidence</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>It should<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>be noted that emerging rating scales include a significant component of judgement on part of the rater. The above criteria are thought to come closest to how we are rated in real life.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Further performance based rating systems call for self-rating by the student and confirmation by instructor.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Unfortunately<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><span> s</span>ome student record systems are unable o unwilling to accommodate this component.</p>

<p>Bishop Carrol High School</p>
<p>“What sets Bishop Carroll apart from other high schools is<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>our unique, personalized, self-directed learning environment, which puts students in the driver’s seat of their educational journey. Here, students have the freedom to customize a learning program they feel is best suited for their unique goals, abilities and interests. With the guidance of a Teacher Advisor and their parents, the student will choose the program and courses they want to follow. Students can then progress through these courses at a personalized rate reflecting their individual needs and learning pace. Although students study at their own pace, they must still follow the curriculum set out by Alberta Education and must fulfill the requirements mandated by the province to receive their Alberta High School Diploma.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The main advantage of self-directed learning is that it empowers the student to take more responsibility and interest in decisions that will affect their education. Students will graduate from Bishop Carroll feeling a unique sense of ownership in their diploma and having had ‘hands-on’ control of their learning.”</p>
