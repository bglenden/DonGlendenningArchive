  D Making and Fixing Things
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">From September 6, 2010, Don reviews Matthew Crawford&#x27;s &quot;Shop Class as Soulcraft,&quot; noting Crawford earned a PhD in political philosophy but operates a motorcycle repair shop. Don endorses the book&#x27;s argument that tangible, hands-on work provides measurable accomplishment and problem-solving satisfaction. He recommends the work to educators, arguing practical skills and troubleshooting ability transfer to life problem-solving. This reflects his emphasis on skills-based, practical education over purely theoretical knowledge.</div>

<p>Dear Sir:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>A friend loaned me a book recently.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As a former Industrial Arts teacher and a lifelong handyman, I recommend it to others, especially to educators.<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>No, it is not a “how to” book for dummies but it certainly laments the loss of tangible work. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Matthew Crawford has a Ph.D. in political philosophy from the University of Chicago and has held a number of prestigious positions in corporate America, but he operates a motorcycle shop in Richmond, Virginia.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>His book, <span>Shop Class as Soulcraft</span>, tells why.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>It is a personal story, an easy read, about the pleasure of craftsmanship, creating with your won hands, the satisfaction of measurable accomplishment, <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I was intrigued with the description of the motorcycle shoop<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>skills of diagnosing, problem solving and immediate rewards of satisfying a customer and putting him on the road again. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>My view good skills that can be applied to solving problems in any in other areas of life.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The book may be a bit wordy; after all, hhe does have a PhD. But is an interesting and easy read.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Should be read by educators but also has an important message for employers.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Don Glendenning</p>
