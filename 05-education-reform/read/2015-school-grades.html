  2015 School grades
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Don distinguishes three purposes of educational testing: diagnostic (to identify support needs), level-setting (to establish subject proficiency), and ranking (comparing individuals against peers). He argues that while diagnostic testing is integral to teaching, teachers are so consumed with curriculum delivery they cannot effectively use diagnostic results. Ranking conflicts with the teacher&#x27;s role and should be relegated to external agencies. Similarly, level-setting should be independent, as occurs in music and apprenticeship. Don advocates for refocusing teacher effort on diagnosis and student support rather than summative evaluation.</div>

<p>Dear Sir:</p>
<p><b>School testing<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></b></p>
<p>The year just finished saw frequent discussions about PISA, PCAP and other tests, and the announcement of another test, a test of basic skills, to be introduced<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>to students in Grades 11 or 12 this year.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We test for several reasons: <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>To diagnose a problem as a basis for deciding how best to help; it is similar to what happens when you visit a doctor.</p>
<p>To establish a level in a subject or field; how far you’ve climbed on the math “mountain”, your “grade” in music, level of apprenticeship or how far you’ve travelled on your quest.</p>
<p>To rank people or organizations against a set of standard criteria in relation to others of the same age, in the same province or studying the same subject<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The first, diagnostic testing, is an integral part of teaching; teachers do it now but, unfortunately, are so focused on delivering the curriculum flowing out of<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Summerside the, have little<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>opportunity to adjust their teaching to reflect their findings. Number three, ranking. conflicts with the role of teacher<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>and, in my view, jeopardizes a teacher’s ability to teach; ranking is a role for an external agency.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My preference would br for level also tEstablishing levels should also be left to an external agency as is now<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>the case for music and apprenticeship.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
