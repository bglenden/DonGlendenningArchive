	arranged to accommodate 6-8 people at tables; some sessions, but not
	all, included IT support.  For early workshops, we provided coffee
	and juice but neither proved popular so now we limit meetings to the

	have  “qualification authorities, (b) Canadian education

charting of a learning path was an “imagine activity”; the
initiative started with a few students, blank flip chart and the
question “what kind of help do you want/need to support your
learning?  Out of it came a number of discussions, a learning path
and a clearer understanding of the conflict that arises when teachers
also grade.  We are The next will likely be a session to chart the
role of teachers followed by “greenfield” projects for in which

Handle with Care is a national program designed to help parents and
other caregivers promote the mental health of young children every
day!  It is useful for everyone who cares for or works with children;
especially parents, grandparents and teachers, and consists of sets
of interactive strategies that build on the strengths of adults in
their daily lives.  The program is based on four building blocks:
Trust and Attachment, Building and Enhancing Self- Esteem, Expressing
Emotions and Building Relationships with Others.  Each block builds
upon the one before and contains the following components: Key
message, Research, Activities, Bringing it Home and Bringing it
Together, other resources and a Summary Handout.   The key to a
successful program is trained facilitators.  Each participant is
required to purchase a text book</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-left: 0.75in; margin-bottom: 0.14in">
Handle with care is a national program developed by Hincks Delcrest
Centre in Toronto and the Canadian Mental Health Association and with
funding from public Health Agency of Canada.  It was piloted with 439
participants in four centres, two in Ontario and one each in Prince
Edward Island and Manitoba.  The developers of the program promote
and allow its use but insist on trained facilitators.  Ms. Taylor was
a member of the original team supervised the testing process in PEI
and is involved in its implementation in Nova Scotia; PEI has at
least two fully trained facilitators and a number of others with some
training.</p>

held on May 14 at the Haviland Club with about 35 participants
present; those present included senior educators, President of

enlarged copy of”A Learning Path” was placed on a tripod as a

<b>3	A Bridge to New Careers:</b> was a presentation by Mr. Gerry
Seaward, Director of Adult Basic Education Program at Holland
College.  Adult Basic Education is an inclusive term covering
instruction to students who, for the most part, are high school
graduates but who lack credits needed for entrance to university or
Holland College. Perhaps the most interesting part of the
presentation was the statistics showing that students not only had
increased their grades from previous years but had actually reduced
the number of days to complete the course. (See enclosures)</p>
