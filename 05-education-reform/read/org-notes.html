<div class="reader-summary">Internal governance notes for Education 20/20 Inc. addressing board composition, director recruitment procedures, and organizational structure. References Don&#x27;s experience with Community Foundation governance and proposes establishing a director selection committee with external representation. Discusses advisory boards modeled on Fundy Community Foundation and other organizations, reflecting Don&#x27;s sophisticated understanding of nonprofit governance and emphasis on community ownership and representation.</div>

<p>CF2.2.1.2</p>
<p><b>Education 20/20 Inc.</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Some Notes on Governance and Organization</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>We spoke on occasion about adding additional Directors; I agree. It is time to act.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Here are some thoughts for your consideration.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They may provide a useful starting point for our discussions</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Functions</b><b></b></p>
<p>No doubt you are aware of the dictum that form follows function.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>For this reason, I’ve attached a preliminary functional analysis.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Number of Directors</b></p>
<p>Our Act allows for xx directors; I am not sure that we need that number at the moment but we could use a few more.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Composition of Board</b><b></b></p>
<p>CFPEI tries to make the board representative of the community.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Since our focus is on providing a quality education, I assume that we should ensure a variety of points of view stakeholders: students, parents, educators, employers, postsecondary institutions, east and west, etc.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The Home and Sch0ol Association states that the majority of Directors shall not be employed in education</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Selection of Directors</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>In the case of the Community Foundation, I recommended a selection committee made up of the chief Justice as Chair and the Mayors of Charlottetown and Summerside, as members.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Some community foundations continue to use a similar arrangement for board recruitment.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>What would you think of striking a committee to select new Directors for Education 20/20 Inc.?</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Fundy Foundation has a board Recruitment Committee consisting of six members including two current directors; the chair of that committee is external.  Both Moncton and the Nova Community Foundation, I believe, still have external nominating committees.  Such an approach, I believe, keeps the "ownership" with the community.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I am not sure if this applies to Education 20/20 or not?</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>If we adopted this approach, each year before the annual meeting, <span>the Committee would meet with the Board to:</span></p>
<p>Confirm vacancies<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Learn strengths needed<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Review long range goals and plans, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Other relevant matters</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The Recruitment Committee would then:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Seek out potential appointees,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Conduct initial interviews</p>
<p>Present candidates at annual meeting</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Advisors</b><b></b></p>
<p>From time to time it may be useful to have access to the advice of prominent citizens on new directions or major initiatives. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Fundy Community Foundation accomplishes this through a group of seven advisors.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There role seems not well specified but my discussion with the Exec Dir. suggests that they are well respected citizens whose opinion is valuable.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Having such a group also adds credibility. Such a group would very seldom be involved in a current decision making but, perhaps, would meet one a year over dinner to be briefed and to offer advice on matters of import to both Education 20/20 and to education.</p>
