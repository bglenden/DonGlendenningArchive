</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Don cites Good&#x27;s Dictionary definition of education as aggregation of processes developing positive societal value abilities. Purpose of education systems is arranging learning experiences. Services include information, counselling, instruction, assessment, educational products, and human resources. While learning is individual, schools serve as convenient gathering places (similar to hospitals or shopping plazas), but learning extends beyond school walls. References 2018 World Bank report criticizing ministries&#x27; education definitions. Don argues PEI has shifted from providing individualized services toward &quot;adding education products&quot; (credits, courses, certificates, degrees) to résumés—the opposite of US trend toward institutional memberships enabling on-demand educational access. Recommends PEI needs: educational terminology glossary, overarching guidelines for decision-making, and collaborative operational framework. Discusses microcredentials as short, specific courses enabling employment/upgrading without excessive student debt. Includes references to competency definitions and learning objectives distinctions.</div>

<p><b>GOING TO SCHOOL 0R GETTING AN EDUCATION</b></p>
<p><b>Good’s </b><span><b>Dictionary of Education</b></span><b> defines education as “the aggregate of all the processes<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>by means of which a person develops abilities of positive value in <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>the society in which he lives.” While I might argue some specific words, this meaning generally reflects my view.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>The purpose of an education system, it seems, is to arrange experiences that help people<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>learn.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Typical education services include the provision of information, counselling, instruction, assessment, educational products and<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>human resources.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Although learning is a personal and individual experience, it is useful and convenient (and sometimes necessary) to bring people together to a place called “school” – a school serves a purpose similar to a hospital or shopping plaza. But learning that counts is not limited to learning in school.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Concern about this belief was expressed ai a 2018 report from the World Bank which chided Ministries as to what constitutes an education.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Your Editor believes that the PEI view of education has changed from that of providing a service to individuals to that of “adding an education product” to one’s resume; products in the form of credits,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>courses, certificates, majors or degrees.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It’s an exact reverse to developments in the US in which colleges and individuals may take “memberships” in institutions and access educational help as needed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>PEI should have a conversation about the emerging model.</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>To move forward, PEI needs:</b></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li8"><b>A glossary of educational terms</b></li>
  <li class="li8"><b>A set of over-arching guidelines as a basis for decision making, and</b></li>
  <li class="li8"><b>A collaborative operational<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>framework<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></li>
</ul>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>POT POURRIA</b></p>
<p><b>Microcredentials</b></p>
<p><b>A recent Hechinger report carried an interesting item on microcredentials; these are short, specific courses or programs that lead to employment or upgrading of work qualifications.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The approach is a natural in times of uncertain employment and makes student debt less foreboding.</b></p>

<p><b>COMPETENCIES</b></p>
<p><b>“In summary, competencies define the applied skills and knowledge that enable people to successfully perform their work, while learning objectives<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>are specific to a course of instruction.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Both should be written in specific, measurable and behavioural terms. Competencies are generally written at a highr level than a learning<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>objective because they require more complex levels of performance.” - Santacatarina</b></p>
