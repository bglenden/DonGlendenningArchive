  6 Why school
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">This substantial piece questions the purpose and design of schools, proposing that educational philosophy should address six life roles: citizen, consumer, family member, producer, individual, and learner. Don conducted informal community surveys about time allocation for each role and discovered lack of consensus on school purposes. He argues that communities should define school mandates before criticizing performance, and that schools cannot simultaneously prepare students for higher education and for practical life roles. The article calls for public discussion to establish shared expectations and accountability.</div>

<p>Dear Editor:</p>
<p>Why send our children to school?</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>This month, thousands of young people returned to school. Some for the first time but most are</p>
<p>returnees. We wish them well; they are our future leaders. Our future depends on them. But their</p>
<p>development and our future is not limited to what they learn in school. Learning in school is important</p>
<p>but schools cannot do it all. The home and the community are also significant players in learning and</p>
<p>education. Not all learning will be positive but all will be important for their future - and</p>
<p>ours.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Each level of education should help young people prepare for the next level of education or for later</p>
<p>1ife". This means earning a living, having a home, being active in community groups, etc. Some young</p>
<p>people will experience a year or two of college or university before entering "the real world". An even</p>
<p>smaller percentage will enter the workforce with a diploma or degree. But FOR all, school is a step on</p>
<p>the road of life-</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>We all fill six life roles - citizen, consumer, family member, producer, individual and learner. Schools</p>
<p>cannot be expected to prepare people for all these roles. But surely schools must assume responsibility,</p>
<p>at least in part, for some. Which ones, to what extent and at what point in a learner's life are crucial</p>
<p>questions. I believe that the community should decide what schools are for and what they should do, or</p>
<p>be. Others believe that such a decision should be left to professional educators" ln the next breath, the</p>
<p>latter group complain about the cost of education and likely about low educational standards. lt is not</p>
<p>fair to criticize schools without giving them a clear mandate. Then and only then, can we hold the</p>
<p>system accountable for results.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>lf we accept that schools should help prepare young people for life roles, what emphasis should be</p>
<p>placed on each role? Does a school have any responsibility to prepare youth to be family members?</p>
<p>Citizens? Producers? We do not share the same views on these questions.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Generally, the focus of our school system is on preparing students or college or university" (Exceptions,</p>
<p>and there some, apply to a very small percentage of School enrolment.) This, I believe, is too narrow a</p>
<p>focus. Preparing students for postsecondary education and preparing them for life are not the same.</p>
<p>Furthermore, only a small percentage of people who enter the education system leave with a college</p>
<p>diploma or degree. What so we expect our schools do, or be, for the others?</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><sup>During the past few weeks I have been asking people about the roles of schools and their expectations</sup></p>
<p><sup>of the education system. I started with the assumption that schools should prepare people for the life</sup></p>
<p><sup>roles which were identified above" While some respondents wanted to talk about those life ro1es, none</sup></p>
<p><sup>argued with the basic premise. ln order to gain a perspective on importance, I asked for a percentage of</sup></p>
<p><sup>school time which should be assigned to preparation for each life role. Jhe survey was not scientific but</sup></p>
<p><sup>the results are interesting" The results of my conversations are shown in the Table below.</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup><br></p>
<p><sup>The figures in the Table are not an average of the allocations. lnstead, I looked at the range and, number</sup></p>
<p><sup>at each point on the range, and then made a judgement call. For example, the range for learner was</sup></p>
<p><sup>from l-O to 40 percent, however, I think that 30 percent is a more representative view.</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup><br></p>
<p><sup>Percentage of Time to be allocated to Each Life Role</sup></p>
<p><sup>Elementary Secondary</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup><br></p>
<p><sup>Citizenship</sup></p>
<p><sup>Consumer</sup></p>
<p><sup>Family member</sup></p>
<p><sup>Producer</sup></p>
<p><sup>lndividual</sup></p>
<p><sup>Learner</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup><br></p>
<p><sup>Total</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup><br></p>
<p><sup>L5</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup><br></p>
<p><sup>20</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup><br></p>
<p><sup>05 15</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup><br></p>
<p><sup>20</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup><br></p>
<p><sup>10</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup><br></p>
<p><sup>10 20</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup><br></p>
<p><sup>20</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup><br></p>
<p><sup>15</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup><br></p>
<p><sup>30 20</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup><br></p>
<p><sup>100 percent</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup><br></p>
<p><sup>But what does all this mean? First, as I said earlier, the survey is not scientific; but it may be indicative.</sup></p>
<p><sup>Second, there is no consensus as to what we expect of our schools. I think that there should be. lt would</sup></p>
<p><sup>be interesting to know if there is any significant difference between the views of the community and</sup></p>
<p><sup>those of educators. lf there is agreement, then this issue can be put to rest. School/community relations</sup></p>
<p><sup>will improve dramatically, I believe, when we reach agreement on this issue alone. lt is time to address</sup></p>
<p><sup>the issue. Even if we cannot come to an agreement, the issue should be fully explored. This is an issue</sup></p>
<p><sup>for the community to settle. We need public discussion now. Otherwise, what passes for improvement</sup></p>
<p><sup>will simply be change.</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup><br></p>
<p><sup></sup><br></p>
<p><sup>Sincerely</sup></p>
<p><sup></sup><br></p>
