<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in; text-indent: 0.5in">Kinkora Regional
High School was thrilled to receive the inaugural 20/20 Education
Award in 2014.  This award recognized how the staff, parents and
community work together to encourage student engagment in their
education. Since winning the Student Engagement Award, students,
staff, parents and the community have continued to support our
students.  
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in; text-indent: 0.5in">Shortly after
receiving the award, the students completed a survey of improvements
they would like to see at Kinkora.   The number one area the students
wanted to see improvement was the cafeteria.  They made a number of
great suggestions.  A group of students worked with administration to
select furniture and the entire school population voted on a paint
color to paint a cozy corner.  Then some students came in over a
school break to paint the area.  Currently, students are creating
original pieces of artwork to display.  The unveiling of this artwork
will take place at the Annual Coffee House this Spring, when students
present their various talents for the community to see.  
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in; text-indent: 0.5in">At the same time
that the students were planning to jazz up the cafeteria, we found
out that the cafeteria service was going to be discontinued because
of our low student population. However, with true Blazer spirit,
staff, parents and students got together to find a solution.  We
currently provide free breakfast program daily, with smoothies on
Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays and healthy lunch options four out of
five days a week for 20 to 30 students daily.  There are also a
number of students, as part of the Agriculture Diploma Program, who
are growing fresh veggies to serve in the cafeteria.  Because the
staff and parents are volunteering, the cost is kept low and the
focus is on providing healthy hot options that students can enjoy. 
The school also partnered with ADL to provide vending machines so the
students can purchase milk daily.  
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in; text-indent: 0.5in">The other major
improvement that the students wanted was the creation of a green
space/outdoor classroom.  This project has taken a bit more planning,
but we are finalizing the details now.  Students in a tech. class
helped create a draft of the outdoor space and we are hoping to have
staff, students and parent volunteers  create the space before the
end of June.  The goal is to create it as an extension of the
classroom. Students in the Agriculture Diploma Program can then use
this outdoor classroom for a number of agriculture related projects
and for the growth of more vegetables to support our cafeteria,  but
many classes would be able to find curriculum links to bring
education outdoors.  The other goal is that the greater community
will become involved.  We are hoping community members can enjoy this
space outside of school hours and hopefully help maintain it while
students are not in school.  
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in; text-indent: 0.5in">We would like to
thank the founding members of Education 20/20 for supporting Kinkora
Regional High and helping us make the school a more comfortable
environment for the students to learn.</p>
