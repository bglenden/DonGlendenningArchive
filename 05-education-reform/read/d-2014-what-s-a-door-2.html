  D 2014 What&#x27;s a door-2
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">A January 2014 Guardian letter where Don uses architectural terminology (inspired by his drafting instructor) to explore fundamental questions: What is a school? What is its purpose? He argues schools provide two services—childcare and education—and questions whether combining them is effective. The draft explores competing definitions of school purposes and the ambiguity in what a high school diploma represents.</div>

<p>Dear Sir:</p>
<p><b>What’s a door?<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></b></p>
<p>Often when trying to solve a problem, I start with a definition or even a series of definitions.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I blame that habit on my architectural drafting instructor of many years ago asking us to define a door but I do believe that it was learning of great practical value. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Sometimes it’s difficult to get straight answers to simple questions.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>For example, at a recent workshop, someone asked the purpose of schools.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>School – a building designed for the purpose of providing providing instruction</p>
<p>School – an institution (building, staff, and supporting services) organized to support instruction</p>
<p>To school is to instruct</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The recent series of winter storms, not surprisingly,gives rise to the question and the role of providing csre while parents work.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Schools certainly provide that service. But should they? Can a school perform both an instructionsal care role\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\/ <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>HYPERLINK "\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\is" <span>\\\\\\\\is</span> it<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If s shouldn[t tb deliberste Is itm a good model to combine both roles<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Can the two roles be combined?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Should the two roleThere certainly is a need and expectation thst chools have a duty of care <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The purpose of a school is to:</p>
<p>Provide instruction</p>
<p>Provide instruction in subjects deemed important for future life roles.</p>
<p>Provide a safe environment for children</p>
<p>Provide a safe environment for children while their parents worl <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Place to accommodate children as they meet the legal rrequirement that they be in school</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Purpose of a diploma:</p>
<p>Recognise that holders have a a standard set of citizenship skills</p>
<p>Rcognize that holder has 12 years of schooling</p>
<p>Recognize that holders have skills needed to enter post secondary studies</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Place to keep our young peoplI know from talking with grandparents and parents about the importance of schools in caring for children while parents work.</p>
<p>At the moment, I would describe schools as a place that provides safe care, socialization skills and instruction.</p>
<p>Hopefully, this will stimulate discussion and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The bottom line is that I am not sure</p>
<p>Firstly, do I write about what it is or what people think it is or what it should be?</p>
<p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Wy of counting convenient, understandable, easy book keeping</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Don Glendenning</p>

<p><br></p>
<p>Maybe it isn’t possible to find or develop a description that meets everyone’s requirementFrom what perspective<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>- what it is, what people think it is or what we want it to become. Maybe describing it from all three perspectives would help with the clarification process.</p>
