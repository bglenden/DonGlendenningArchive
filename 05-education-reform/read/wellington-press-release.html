<p>April 8, 2014</p>
<p>For immediate release</p>
<p><b>Looking for solutions</b></p>
<p>Participants in a recent workshop at Centre Goeland in Cap Egmont moved quickly from talking about issues and challenges in education to the matter of finding solutions.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Communities need an education system that helps both Individuals and the community to develop their full potential, personal, cultural, social and economic.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The educational needs of people are holistic and seamless; institutions, on the other hand, organize by levels, roles, and offerings; to better respond to student needs, some realignment of services may be needed. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The first half of the workshop focused on a recent survey by the Community Foundation of Prince Edward Island on issues facing Island youth.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Over 200 Island youth participated in the survey and, among other things, had identified their preparation for work and for further education as a matter of concern.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The presentation included a review of methodology and findings and was led by Steve McQuaid, Vice President of the Community Foundation of Prince Edward Island and Katherine MacDonald, Researcher; the report is available on the Foundation website, www.cfpei.ca. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Some school issues and challenges result from the way we structure our education system others reflect our views about education.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>How we group students, the link between engagement and achievement, the role of other community organizations reflect one’s view of learners and the learning process; on the other hand, flexibility, school autonomy and accountability are issues related to how we structure a system. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Participants were thanked by Don Glendenning, President of Education 20/20 Inc., a new educational organization on PEI committed to improving the quality of education for every Canadian.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Anyone interested in its activities or to be placed on the mailing list for the monthly newsletter, should check the website, www.education2020.ca</p>
