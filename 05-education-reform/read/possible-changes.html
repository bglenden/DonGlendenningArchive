<p><b>EDUCATION 20/20 INC.</b></p>
<p>Date:	August 18, 2014</p>
<p>To: 	File</p>
<p>Subject: Possible Amendments to our Act of Incorporation</p>
<p><br></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li2">Some directors suggested a change from “A Quality Education for Every Canadian” Learning to live-living to learn</li>
  <li class="li4"><b>Membership:</b></li>
</ul>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li4">We need a statement as to what it means to be a member of Education 20/20 Inc.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Presumably a member shares our interest in providing a quality education for every Canadian; presumably we should provide for a membership fee even if we<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>set it at zero.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Are there other criteria? We’ve also spoken of our network which could be as simply anyone who is on our mailing list.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>What do you think?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li5"><b>Here’s a stab at a draft membership statement:<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Members of Education 20/20 translate their earnest interest in Canadian education into focused studying, sharing, monitoring, encouraging of the continuous improvement of education policy and practice.”</b></li>
  <li class="li5">Here is another stab building on Tom’s: “Members of Education 20/20 are individuals who value a quality education for every Canadian and, through research, evaluation and advocacy, encourage continuous improvements in education policy and practice.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li6">Members of Education 20/20 Inc. are individuals who value a quality education and encourage continuing evidence- based improvement.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li4"><b>Sub-groups:</b></li>
</ul>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li4">Geographic groups: Regional, provincial, local ?</li>
  <li class="li4">Interest groups:<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>math, essential skills, community educators (JA, Cadets, 4H)</li>
  <li class="li4">Students:<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>newcomers, math<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li5"><b>I am ambivalent about the geographic groups; I would add information technology to #2; I would collapse 3 and 4 into “ad hoc groups as interest suggests</b></li>
  <li class="li8">Under the group section, you may want to consider adding official languages in education groups (such as Canadian Parents For French and the francophone parents group) </li>
  <li class="li6"><b>Interest groups as interests suggest such as languages, technology, community educators, newcomers to a community</b></li>
</ul>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li4"><b>Services we will not provide:</b></li>
</ul>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li4">When asked in our original submission to name an activity that we would not be take on, I said “not engage in instruction except for demonstration projects”;<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>perhaps we should change that. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Your thoughts?</li>
  <li class="li5"><b>I think so, as it might constrain us if we wanted to sponsor workshops or a model course.</b></li>
  <li class="li5"><b>I can suggest we add that we “will not provide any direct front line educational services that are the responsibility of provincial governments.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></li>
  <li class="li6">We will not provide normal front line instructional services</li>
