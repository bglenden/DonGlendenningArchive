  1-year end 3
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Year-end outlook letter (duplicate/similar to File 10) forecasting education system stagnation given reliance on outdated 30-year-old philosophy without addressing conceptual clarity between education (universal) and formal instruction (school-based). Notes federal education-for-employment leadership historically provided through federal-provincial agreements but since withdrawn. Discusses postsecondary cost escalation and administrative overhead concerns, particularly regarding graduate student teaching loads. Addresses school board restoration&#x27;s potential impact contingent on professional autonomy and accountability provisions.</div>

<p><b>Education Outlook for 20/20</b></p>
<p><b>Education outlook for coming year looks relatively unchanged. Government expected to rely on existing statement of philosophy.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There is not indication that education will deal with the confusing application of education to both formal study in school and the broad term implying help to all learners.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Insiders report that the fear factor is still a major challenge to open debate.</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Historically, education for employment has depended on both financial and educational leadership by the Federal Government (since the Technical Education of 1919); the leadership elemnt was drawn a few years ago.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Yhe recent rsh of ad hoc education services is viewed as an attempt to deal with the problem.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>, I believe at the insistence of the provinces.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Its future not had much Provincial support Likliihood that education for employment will receive a boost.</b></p>
<p><b>The reference to costs of postsecondary education is interesting one;that topic has certainly been an active topic in US scene.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>people familiar with the scene. According to some studies, post secondary costs, especially administrative overhead, haave gotten out of control some would say on the backs of graduate students who do much of the actual teaching.</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Isanders will appreciate the return of school boards; it certainly is a good political move; whether it will contribute to better education will depend in a large part to the degee o autonomy qnd ccountability included.</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Sincerely</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
