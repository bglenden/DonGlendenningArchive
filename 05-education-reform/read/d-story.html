  D story
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Don addresses PEI&#x27;s &quot;conceptual clarity problem&quot; in education discourse. Despite searching the Department of Education, school websites, CAMET, CMEC, and CEA, he finds only one definition (from Home and School Federation). He criticizes the interchangeable use of &quot;education&quot; and &quot;schooling,&quot; citing World Bank research showing these are distinct concepts. Don argues that PEI operates a &quot;school system,&quot; not an &quot;education system,&quot; and that traditional school structures are inadequate given contemporary educational changes across Canada and globally. He advocates for a comprehensive definition encompassing education at all levels and kinds.</div>

<div class="reader-content">
<p>Dear Editor:</p>
<p>A Question of Clarity</p>
<p>Education has a clarity problem; the literature refers to the problem as one of ”conceptual clarity”. For example, my search for a definition of “education” included the Department of Education, several school sites, CAMET, CMEC and the CEA. The only definition I actually found was on the Home and School web site. Seems to me that “education” should be defined and or described everywhere.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we have a habit of using “education and schooling” interchangeably. Both “education” and “schooling” are important but, as the World Bank points out, they are not the same.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I talk with a lot of Islanders about education, the public also seems to know the difference.</p>
<p>In fact, PEI operates a school system. Given the changes in education happening across Canada and around the world, a traditional school system is no longer adequate.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It would be nice if we could find a definition that encompass education at all levels and of all kinds.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
<p>Don Glendenning</p>
