  2011-8 Elephant
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Using the parable of blind men describing an elephant, Don identifies the underlying &quot;elephant in the room&quot; as the absence of market forces and competition in public education. While others blame teachers&#x27; unions, home support, or low standards, Don argues the core issue is monopolistic government control lacking accountability, choice, and transparency. He contends the system prioritizes schooling over education, operates without clear student outcomes, discourages growth in favor of conformity, and fails to treat teachers as professionals. The letter demonstrates Don&#x27;s market-oriented thinking about systemic improvement.</div>

<p>Dear Sir:</p>
<p><b>The Elephant in the Classroom</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I was reminded recently of a story from an early school text about "Blind Men and an Elephant".</p>
<p>A number of blind men were asked to describe an elephant. Depending on where they touched,</p>
<p>one reported that the elephant was like a tree, another said a wall, and a third man said a snake;</p>
<p>others said a fan, a spear or a rope. ln some versions of the story, the blind men even came to</p>
<p>blows while defending their views. ln one sense, all were correct, however, had they gathered</p>
<p>more information or discussed their findings with each other or the elephant trainer, a more</p>
<p>accurate picture of the elephant would likely have emerged.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The above story is relevant because, I believe, there is an elephant in our schoolroom.</p>
<p>("Elephant in the room" is an expression that describes an obvious problem that we tend to</p>
<p>ignore; instead of dealing with it, we pretend it does not exist. Exposing it, we feel, carries too</p>
<p>many risks.)</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>l've talked to a number of people about the elephant and most seem to think that the elephant</p>
<p>is the teachers union, lack of support in the home or low standards. From my perspective, it's</p>
<p>none, or perhaps all, of the above. I think the elephant is the complete absence of a market</p>
<p>place forces in the school system, the absence of choice; instead, we have a monopoly run by</p>
<p>the Government that:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Emphasizes schooling over education</p>
<p>Operates on fuzzy student outcomes</p>
<p>Lacks accountability</p>
<p>Fails to treat teachers as professionals</p>
<p>Encourages conformity rather than growth, and</p>
<p>Lacks transparency</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I encourage you to talk about the school "elephant" over your next cup of coffee with friends -</p>
<p>and send me a note with your views.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
