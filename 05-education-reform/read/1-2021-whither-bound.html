<div class="reader-summary">Don questions PEI&#x27;s unclear education mission, comparing it unfavorably to Health&#x27;s goal of &quot;accessible quality health services&quot; and Agriculture&#x27;s goal of innovation. He criticizes the Department&#x27;s limitation to &quot;children birth to Grade 12&quot; as narrow, notes confusion between schooling and education (citing the World Bank), and observes that most developed nations have qualification authorities to rationalize credentials, while Canada and the USA lack these. Don calls for clear leadership that removes conceptual confusion about education&#x27;s purpose and scope.</div>

<p><b>Editor,</b></p>

<p><b>Charlottetown, PEI	</b></p>

<p><b>Dear Sir:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b>Whither bound</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>In the mid-1950’s I spent a year at an American; I lived off campus in a private home with cooking privileges. My landlady was legally blind; she was also deeply religious. On my bedside table was a little booklet with the title “WHITHER BOUND?”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I think of these words often these days as I reflect on the future of education in PEI; based mostly on what I read and hear, the mission of public remains unclear.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I say this because:</p>
<p>The Department has limited itself only to “children from birth to Grade 12” that seems narrow, compared to the Minister of Health, for example, who describes its role as that of providing accessible quality health services throughout the Province” or the ministry of Agriculture with a goal of leading “ our Province in efforts to innovate our agriculture and agri-food sectors”.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Education needs and deserves an equivalent role.</p>
<p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The education literature and dialogue, including that emanating <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>from the Department of Education, seems to equate going to school and getting an education; my dictionaries say otherwise. so does the World Bank.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is impossible to insist on quality among this confusion.</p>
<p>Another example of confusion presents itself with the awarding of credentials – certificates, diplomas and degrees; .<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Many countries resolve the issue through the establishment of qualification authorities; Canada and the USA are exceptions.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Or perhaps<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>a more detailed report card would serve the purpose</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The Department plays a leadership role, removing confusion would be a good start.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
