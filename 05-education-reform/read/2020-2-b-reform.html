  2020-2 B Reform
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">This working paper reflects Don Glendenning&#x27;s analysis of education challenges on PEI based on organizational activities, director discussions, committee work, and personal experience. He identifies that the system needs overhaul with major issues in clarity, structure, communication, autonomy, and accountability. Don critiques education being treated as a product rather than service, notes the gap between community needs and system delivery, and concludes the current system cannot support needed changes. For Education 20/20, he proposes establishing a broad-based, independent professional organization representing all education providers. He challenges current directors about leadership commitment and outlines options: elect new officers, suspend operations, or wind up. A reminder about PEI&#x27;s &quot;fear factor&quot; affecting professional expression indicates Don&#x27;s awareness of political and bureaucratic constraints on reform.</div>

<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li3">Education could benefit from a broad based, independent professional organization with a focus on education rather than instruction.
