  D-3 Educational climate
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Don observes positive shifts in PEI&#x27;s education landscape, attributing changes to election debates, budget discussions, new leadership (Minister and Deputy Minister), and advocacy from local business chambers and youth. He commends the Department&#x27;s graduation requirement review and chambers&#x27; attention to literacy needs. However, he scrutinizes the Secondary Literacy Assessment policy, noting that students must write but need not pass, results serve teachers rather than students, and business/postsecondary input was not explicitly solicited despite their expressed concerns. This letter demonstrates Don&#x27;s capacity for balanced critique—recognizing progress while holding institutions accountable to implementation details and stakeholder engagement.</div>

<p>Editor,</p>
<p>Charlottetown Guardian</p>
<p>Charlottetown, PEI	</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Dear Sir:</p>
<p><b>A noticeable change in the education climate<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>I detect a change in the education landscape in PEI.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>No douby the change benefitted from the election debates, reaction to budgets cuts, arrival of a new Minister and Deputy Minister, concerns expressed publicly a few months ago by the Charlottetown and Summerside Chambers of Commerce or maybe the concerns of youth about their education as revealed in<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>the report by CFPEI.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>in a reportas exoressed by the report of First I want to commend the Department for its ongoing review of graduation requirements; I also commend the Charlottetown and Summerside Chambers of Commerce for their literacy needs to the Departments attention.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As for the course changes, I understand that courses need to be revised and updated from time to time but my reading of the literature suggests that research does not support our rigid graduation requirements.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I find the wording of the section the Secondary Literacy Assessment to be very interesting.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It says that students must write the exam<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>but does not say they must pass it, results will be used to help teachers rather than students, and there is no mention of soliciting suggestions from the Chambers or postsecondary institutions although their concerns seem to have triggered the change.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Don Glendenning</p>
<p>A long-time student of education</p>
