<p><b>RESTRUCTURING EDUCATION</b></p>
<p><b>21-2-C</b></p>
<p>Island educators are reluctant to talk about education; it’s more than r4eluctant, they’re afraid. Storm days, ratios, class composition, and technology yes; math levels, individual profiles, and soft-skills and training for employment are non-starters. I’ve been trying to figure out why.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Here are my conclusions.attribute the reluctance to the way we’ve structured the system.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>First, we’ve embedded education deeply into the political system.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Whether you teach, who you teach, when you teach, what you teach, how long you teach are determined by the” head office”.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>I first heard about structural impediments in the education system a few years ago from a PEI trustee. Then in 2011, the OECD recommended more autonomy to schools for their day- to- day operation as a way to improve PISA test results. in 2018, the World Bank, the largest funder of educational services, spoke about improving an education system by delegating certain operational practices to schools and intermediary bodies. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>and just a few weeks ago, a friend forwarded information from UNESCO about the structure of educational services.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And that’s not to forget a “Call for Action” by Education 2020 Inc. in 2015, newspaper items and the many comments from retired educators and Island citizens at large. And I’ve encountered the “fear factor’<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>First a few words about education. For me, education is an umbrella word and includes all learning experiences wherever, whenever and however initiated, carried out and paid for. Education results in changes in the way a person thinks, feels or acts and many changes, some say all, are observable. In other words, we are all educated. Obviously, some people are better educated than others. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I happen to like the description of well educated as the “state that allows a person<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>adequately cope with all demands of daily life’.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Many suggest that service is no longer the focus. students are simply looking for the piece of paper , the<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“pass”, the credit, diploma or degree.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Changes in one’s education are usually reflected in the way a person thinks, feels and acts. Purposes are expressed in a variety of ways:</p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li2">Prepare children for further study</li>
  <li class="li2">Develop skills, knowledge attitudes needed to thrive in a democratic society</li>
  <li class="li2">Develop skills needed to maintain our community as a place we want to live</li>
  <li class="li2">Develop ”the ability to manage one’s self.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
</ul>
<p>	</p>
<p>	In Canada, education is a Provincial responsibility; typical services include:</p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li2">Governance and leadership</li>
  <li class="li2">Funding</li>
  <li class="li2">Instruction</li>
  <li class="li2">Human resources</li>
  <li class="li2">Products and technology</li>
  <li class="li2">Quality assurance</li>
  <li class="li2">Information and counselling</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p>The problem. as I see it, is two- fold. (1) Government has adopted a narrow vision as to what constitutes education confusing it with school studies and (2) simply folded it into existing government<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>folded the bundle into a political body. confused it with running schools, and delivered it with military precision. We need to go back to the drawing board.</p>
<p>An overhaul is in order: seems like a perfect role for<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>the Legislative committee on Education.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
<p><br></p>
