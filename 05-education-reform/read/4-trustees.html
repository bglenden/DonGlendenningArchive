  4-Trustees
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Don reiterates his support for elected trustees, now reviewing the Schools Act and internet resources. He identifies two Department concerns: (1) the Department frames its role as &quot;developing and delivering programs&quot; rather than encouraging all Islanders to improve education, and (2) the Department conflates schooling and education. Drawing on Montreal Economic Institute, OECD, and World Bank sources, Don argues that trustee usefulness depends on permitted decision-making authority. He calls for updating PEI&#x27;s education vision statement before deciding on board structure, citing Education 2020 Inc.&#x27;s 2015 recommendation for a clear vision as the foundation.</div>

<p>February 2021</p>
<p>Editor:</p>
<p>Elected Trustees</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I believe in the public education system.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I was pleased, therefore, when my morning paper carried an item that “elected trustees” is back on the agenda.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Government was seeking public input; I decided to write a letter of support.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>First, however, I reviewed the Schools Act and scanned a few items on the internet. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>My review of Department of Education documents revealed two items of concern.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>First, the Department describes its role as one of<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“developing and delivering programs” to the young.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I beg to differ.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I believe that the Department should encourage all Islanders. to improve their education; whether or not Government pays for all education is a different question.<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Secondly, as the World Bank points out, Ministries need to understand that going to school and getting an education are not the same thing; the Department literature does not always make that clear.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The key to whether Boards are useful, I concluded, depends on the decisions they are allowed or encouraged to make. Based on my own experience and recent documents from the <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Montreal Economic Institute, the OECD and the World Bank,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I feel that the Province should first update its education vision statement.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>With a well-defined vision, the matter of an appropriate structure will be more evident.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Only then can we decide the role of schools and whether or not trustees are needed or beneficial.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>For the record, Education 2020 Inc. published some recommendations on education in April, 2015 with the first recommendation being the development of “a clear and compelling vision of education for all Islanders”. I believe that the first step in the improvement process.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
<p><br></p>
