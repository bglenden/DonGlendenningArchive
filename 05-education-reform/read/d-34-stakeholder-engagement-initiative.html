  D 34 Stakeholder Engagement Initiative
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">A comprehensive November 2013 proposal establishing Education 20/20 Inc.&#x27;s stakeholder engagement strategy. Don articulates a diagnosis that education systems are failing to prepare citizens for the future due to structural inflexibility and lack of market accountability. His three-pronged solution involves: information provision about best practices and needed changes, stakeholder engagement through conversations and debates, and creating incentives for organizations demonstrating best practices. Specific activities include monthly electronic newsletters, occasional papers, video webinars, media releases, blogs, public forums, speaker bureaus, and surveys. This vision demonstrates Don&#x27;s belief that systems change requires simultaneously improving information access, fostering dialogue, and recognizing excellence.</div>

<p><b>Education 20/20 INC.</b></p>
<p><b>Stakeholder Engagement<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Initiative</b></p>
<p><b>November 15, 2013</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Purpose:</b> <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>To provide stakeholders with current information about informed opinion, research and best practices about education and to encourage them to become get involved in promoting and supporting a quality education for every Canadian.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Background</b></p>
<p>It is widely recognized that the level and quality of our education is key to our future including our futures as individuals, families, communities and countries. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But this view is tempered with a concern that the education currently available is not preparing nor likely to prepare our people, especially our young people, for the future.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The Conference Board of Canada in calling for greater emphasis on the fundamental skills of literacy and numeracy, the skills of self-management and the ability to work as a team member.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In addition, tomorrow’s citizens both high level technical and entrepreneurial skills.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Public Education is a line department of Provincial governments with instruction organized in a time<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>based subject centered batch process offering little in the way of support for innovative thinking and independent learning.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As a consequence, many Canadians leave the public school system without either adequate basic skills or an entrepreneurial spirit. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The system must change but it is unlikely that it will make the desired changes without some outside help. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We say this based on the view that the education enterprise lacks the usual market measures that ensure change. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This need is becoming increasingly obvious. It is our view that, both in PEI and elsewhere, that shortfall is increasingly becoming recognized, brought on by a number of events including international competition, on-line-delivery of courses, student demand, large numbers of young people without sufficient basic skills, declining postsecondary enrolments, funding shortages, changing student demand and job skill requirements. To provide this kind of education will require a system that is flexible, transparent, customized with<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>accountable clearly identified standards</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Change is fuelled by Information,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>however, we know that having information itself doesn’t guarantee change – but information certainly supports it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We feel that education sector, compared with other sectors, falls short in the nature and amount of information available to users and the public.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Think of the information, for example, that we receive day in and day out about cancer, diabetes, Alzheimers, the dangers of smoking as well as many other matters relating to our health services.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We need that kind of information about matters of education, information such as early detection of reading problems, helping with homework, standards or independent study.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Successful change will be built upon access to a variety of relevant information and community engagement.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In addition, providing the public with relevant information, this focus<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>will support the public in its quest for greater participation in the education process.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Little choice, does not encourage independent study, time based, batch process</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Enter Education 20/20 Inc., a new independent national organization with the mission of ensuring a quality education for every Canadian.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>(Vision statement attached) Against this background, a number of Islanders, seasoned in both the providing and using educational services, have come together<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>to form Education 20/20 Inc. a national, not for profit, independent<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>organization committed to providing a quality education for every Canadian.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>(See attached mission statement)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We’ve taken a look at the state of education and levers of change, we’ve decided to focus our activities activities on the general public represented by parents, employers and students and to initiate a three-pronged effort to bring about change.</p>

  <li class="li4"><b>Engagement<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>of stakeholders</b>– To provoke, organize and support opportunities to involve the public, including parents, employers and students in conversations, dialogues, debates and exchanges in a wide range of educational matters including philosophy, standards, curriculum, flexibility. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
