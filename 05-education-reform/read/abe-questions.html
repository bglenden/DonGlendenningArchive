  ABE Questions
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Opinion piece on adult basic education (ABE) gaps and questions about secondary-to-postsecondary transitions in PEI (appears to be from Education 20/20 newsletter context). Don questions why high school graduates needing remedial coursework cannot retake courses at secondary level, why taxpayers fund redundant services, and whether curriculum committees should include employers. Raises systemic questions about funding structures and communication gaps. Demonstrates Don&#x27;s continued critical analysis of education policy, advocacy for practical solutions, and engagement with contemporaneous education debates in PEI through 2016 and beyond.</div>

<div class="reader-content">
<p><b>The reason why</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>It is interesting how questions beget more questions.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Readers may recall that the previous Newsletter included a panel of questions; the one about the use of postsecondary dollars seemed to strike a sensitive chord.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Here are some background notes and more questions.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span>In late 2013, The Community Foundation of Prince Edward Island (CFPEI) undertook a survey of over 200 Island youth to identify issues that directly affect them; the report, T</span><span>aking the Pulse of Island Youth</span><span>, available on the Foundation’s website at www.cfpei.ca, provides a snapshot of the findings.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span></span>Bright spots include a positive sense of community, emerging entrepreneurial spirit, volunteerism and new postsecondary offerings. The main concerns include a lack of jobs, surviving on low-paying jobs, educational deficiencies and drug and alcohol addictions.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>On the subject of education and learning, the study reports a high rate of completion of high school and postsecondary education, a high level of inclusivity and relatively affordable tuition costs; young people also<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>expressed concerns about their readiness for the next stage of life including: <span>“preparedness gaps with regard to readiness for</span></p>
<p>postsecondary study and the workplace. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Employers, parents, grsndparents and others have expressed a similar concern about the level of basic skills among high school graduates. The Greater Chatlottetown Chamber of Commerce lists education as their number one concern. And I’m told that education is a frequent topic discussed by the Summerside Chamber as well.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Ecently an item appeared in the local media to the effect that some University students were looking for credit for prequalification courses offered at UPE; presumably some of UPEI postsecondary dollars are being used for upgrading purposes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>At the same time, we know that the Provinve supports large numbers Islanders, including recent graduates, in academic upgrading classes at Holland College.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Neither the nature of the gap nor the numbers affected are known at the moment and It is possible that the gaps are not real or that the problem is one of communication only.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Whatver the case, a simple survey using current msth, science and communication outcomes should quickly the details of the gap, if any, sfter which a plan of action could be prepared.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The questions run something like this:</p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li3">If a recent high school graduate wanting to enroll in postsecondary subjects but lacking the necessary credits to do so, eturn to his/her alma mater for the additional credits needed?</li>
  <li class="li3">Why should taxpayers be paying twice for essentially a epeat of the same service?</li>
  <li class="li3">Is funding of adult basic education courses part of the 235 million, part of the allocation for post secondary studies ir federal dollars</li>
  <li class="li3">We know that university and college teachers often sit as members of curriculum committees, shouldn’t employers also be present?</li>
  <li class="li3">Given the importance of education to the welfare of the economy, shouldn’t the Department maintain liaison offices with employer organizations.</li>
  <li class="li3">Shouldn’t local economic development authorities include the local high school principal<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
</ul>
