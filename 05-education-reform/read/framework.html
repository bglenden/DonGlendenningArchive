<div class="reader-summary">Comprehensive educational framework document articulating education as a service, economic sector, and performance standard. Contextualizes education within community (PEI population 160,000), individual life roles (individual, family member, citizen, consumer, producer), and essential learning domains (math, science, communication, soft skills, self-care). Emphasizes that community futures depend on educational quality and that education must serve multiple life roles, not just academic preparation.</div>

<p><b>Dear Editor:</b></p>
<p><b>Guardian-D-20</b></p>
<p><b>AN EDUCATION FRAMEWORK FOR PEi</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>As they travel the road of life. a metaphor for the experiences one encounters between birth and death, each person fills a number of life road, that of an “individual, a family member, a citizen, a student, a consumer and producer.” They also encounter many obstacles including time, age, responsibilities, geography, interests, capacities and funding, obstacles which may even be compounded and compromised by those we meet along the way: they also encounter obstacles that can be mastered by improved education – lack of skills, qualifications, and credentials. and of course the personal baggage of culture and our personal make up.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>At any point they may find that that the skills they have and the skills they need will frequently differ.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The process of developing new skills, knowledge and attitudes is called learning and the discernable change that occur in us as a result of learning is called education. Education 20/20 convened a group of learners; they told us they needed, but not necessarily at the same time, Information, counselling, demonstrations, instruction, diagnosis,, learning plans, encouragement, etc. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>An education system is put in place by a community to encourage and support the education of its people; Typical education services to a community, known as functions to the organization offering them, include:</p>
<p>•	Information: recent, independent, reliable, timel<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>•	Instruction: presentation, tutoring, demonstrations, debate, diagnosis, coaching and guided practice.</p>
<p>•	Feedback:<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>effective, valid, transparent, relevant</p>
<p>•	Counselling: planning, coaching, referral, advocacy</p>
<p>•	Funding: access, space, time, funding, practice</p>
<p>•	Products and technologies: texts, reference, self instructional material, MOOC’s and assistive technologies</p>
<p>•	Leadership and Governance: Planning, research, advocacy, encouragement, quality assurance.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Number of ways</p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li8">Typically delivers by grouping students by age and previous education in Institutions,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li8">Age</li>
  <li class="li8">Years of prior education</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Deliver educational services typically involves the following functions, Provinces<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>put together a set of institutions, systems and services</p>
<p>Where do we start and how do we put it all together; Need an education system</p>
<p>Develop a set of guiding principles such s:</p>
<p>Encourage everybody</p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li8">Province will encourage and promote education among its citizens</li>
  <li class="li8">Province will cover full cost of the following education services: literacy, numeracy, self management,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>required for citizenship in a modern economy</li>
  <li class="li8">Every Islander or Island family<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>will have access to a professional education adviser,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li8">Establish Independent qualification authority</li>
  <li class="li8">Directtors of educational services<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>geographic<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Under the British North America Act, education in Canada is a provincial responsibility, however, both levels of government are major investors; support is provided for two reasons,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>firstly for the benefit of individual citizens and, secondly to ensure the availability of the skilled people needed to maintain<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>the future of the community in which citizens live.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p>The nature and availability of a quality education will, in large measure, determine the future of individual Canadians, Canadian communities and Canada itself; in view of its importance and given the concern about the state of public education, some thoughts<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>on a framework for making educational decisions may be in order.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The Road of Life is one such framework; it starts with the view that one’s education is preparation for the next stage on the road of life.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Having a framework for learning increases the chances of making relevant decisions and making those decisions more consistently.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It also provides common language and perspectives when collaborating with colleagues in the field.</p>
