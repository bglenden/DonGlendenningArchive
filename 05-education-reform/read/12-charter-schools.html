  12 Charter Schools
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Don Glendenning frames the charter schools debate, moving beyond simplistic arguments about public versus private education. He identifies five fundamental issues deserving public attention: the distinction between education and schooling, differing stakeholder expectations for schools, roles and responsibilities of various parties, the significance of credentials, and whether teaching and certification should remain separate functions. Rather than advocating for charter schools outright, he calls for thoughtful debate on these foundational questions that affect all educational models.</div>

<p>Editor</p>
<p>Charlottetown Guardian</p>
<p>Charlottetown, PEI</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Dear Editor:</p>
<p>Charter schools</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Recently we were presented through this newspaper with two quite different views on the issue of</p>
<p>charter schools. The reasons why one supports or does not support private schools are many and</p>
<p>varied and depend, to a large extent, on one's role as a stakeholder and experience as a student,</p>
<p>parent, teacher, administrator, employer, labour representatives or Minister. One's reasons also</p>
<p>depend on one's beliefs.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>lssues raised in the articles include: local versus centralized control, reducing or containing costs,</p>
<p>school transportation, small and usually rural schools , public versus private schools, lack of</p>
<p>research on educational issues, innovation and change, choice and relevance. These issues are</p>
<p>worthy of public debate. I hope that the two recent articles will trigger it.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>ln addition to the issues identified in the articles, however, I believe there are some even more</p>
<p>fundamental issues that deserve our attention. These include:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>the difference between education and schooling. We use the words interchangeably. While the</p>
<p>latter is an important and makes a major contribution, education is more than schooling.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>our expeotations ofthe contribution of schooling to the development of each learner. While</p>
<p>the answer may seem obvious, my discussions reveal sharp differences among students,</p>
<p>teachers, parents and employers. lt appears that each stakeholder has a different set of criteria</p>
<p>against which schools are measured.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>responsibilities and accountabilities of each stakeholder. What, for example, are the</p>
<p>responsibilities of each learner, parent, a teacher and the community atlarge including the</p>
<p>business sector?</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>the significance of certificates, diplomas and degrees. Current credentials are geared to</p>
<p>student who are college or university bound; should we have a parallel set of credentials for</p>
<p>the 50 percent of our students who go to work rather than to higher education? And is it not a</p>
<p>conflict of interest to have those who teach also certify? Teaching and certifying (sorting) are</p>
<p>entirely separate functions and should be recognized as such. Why do we need certificates,</p>
<p>diplomas and degrees and who should award them?</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
<p><br></p>
