<p><b>Diagnostic (Psycho-educational) Assessment</b></p>
<p>A diagnostic assessment is undertaken when a learning disability is suspected or when significant learning difficulties are noted. These assessments vary, based on background information and the nature of the referral question, and may include measures of cognitive ability (intelligence), achievement (academic abilities), memory, reading and visual perceptual skills. Other screening devices such as attentional (ADD/ADHD) difficulties, and social-emotional difficulties (anxiety, depression, and so forth), may be used to refine the assessment and identify appropriate interventions.</p>
<p>A diagnostic assessment consists of three to six meetings with a diagnostic examiner. The sessions last between one and three hours. Diagnostic examiners are trained and qualified to administer, score and interpret psychological and educational test batteries. A detailed report is composed and a feedback session arranged to discuss the results, interpretation and recommendations with clients and their referral sources.</p>
<p><b>Career Assessment</b></p>
<p>The purpose of a career assessment is to examine dimensions of careers and career traits in reference to client traits to help facilitate good career choices. The assessment may address career interests, aptitudes, personality, achievement level, and work values, depending upon the referral.</p>
<p>The process generally consists of one to three meetings with an examiner, and the client completes a number of inventories outside of the sessions. The sessions last between one and three hours. Reports and feedback sessions are arranged to facilitate understanding and promote action.</p>
<p><b>Assessment for specific professions</b></p>
<p>These services are reserved for individuals or organizations that are seeking a candidate with highly specific sets of skills and personal characteristics. Though capacity in this domain can be expanded, the current area of expertise is in identifying those who would most likely be able to perform successfully in fields where public safety issues are of significant concern, such as policing services, armed emergency response teams, armed security personnel and conservation officers.</p>
