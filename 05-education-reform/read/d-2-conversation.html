  D-2 Conversation
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">A February 12, 2020 letter to the editor calling for public conversation about education. Don argues that service-centered education became product-focused, with educators withdrawing from public discourse into professional silos. He quotes an Ontario education activist&#x27;s five critical questions and advocates for an all-party panel to lead structured public discussion about education fundamentals. This piece reveals Don&#x27;s concern about public disconnection from education policy.</div>

<p>February 12. 2020</p>
<p>Dear Editor:</p>
<p>CONVERSATION NEEDED</p>
<p>Life is complex; people fill many roles; there is much to be learned - to communicate, to get along with others, to look after ourselves and .to look after the environment.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It’s more than many parents can handle; parents need help; the rest of us need help too. It’s in the interests of the community to provide help. But providing help is complex. There are so many people, such a range of differences, disparate needs, etc. etc.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Government wants to help, so they set up a system of schools; decide what everyone needs and that all young people must attend<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>– but service got lost, education become a product described by hours, lessons, outcomes, grades, requirements, diplomas, degrees, years of schooling, etc.; responding to citizen needs is no longer part of the equation; educators seem to have withdrawn from public conversation and, stay inside their respective silos.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Service” and education got lost in the process.</p>
<p>It’s time It’s time for a public conversation about education; to quote a long- time education activist from Ontario:</p>
<p>	<i>“The public, all the people in an organized, preferably democratic, society/state should/must 	take ownership of how their young are educated. Everyone and especially parents should be 	partners in setting the responses to the following issues: <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></i></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li1"><i>why should the state educate it’s citizens? <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></i></li>
  <li class="li1"><i>How should the state educate it’s citizens? <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></i></li>
  <li class="li1"><i>Who should decide when a citizen is educated?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></i></li>
  <li class="li1"><i>What part of the state’s limited resources should be put towards educating every 	citizen?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Who decides how much?</i></li>
  <li class="li1"><i>Should schools be operated? As<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>a for profit business?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Like a community library? Like a not for 	profit hospital with a chief medical officer and a chief admin officer?</i></li>
</ul>
<p><i>	Currently there are so many players with different and conflicting agendas involved with public 	education it is no wonder “schools” are either dysfunctional or operational at a high social, 	psychological, emotional, organizational stress level...</i></p>
<p>.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Islanders deserve to be better informed but also to be consulted about education – what it is, who it’s for, principles on which it will operate, what government will pay for, etc.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Because of the fear factor, any conversation likely needs o be sanctioned, and probably led, by the Minister. In the spirit of political cooperation, perhaps an all- party panel could be struck to lead such a discussion.</p>
