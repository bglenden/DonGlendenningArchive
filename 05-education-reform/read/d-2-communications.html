<div class="reader-summary">Don addresses a different aspect of alignment: the coherence between learning outcomes, curriculum, assessment, and reporting. He defines outcomes as a contract between teacher and student, each holding a copy. He outlines specific alignment challenges: curriculum disconnected from assessment, assessment disconnected from life outcomes, and reporting misaligned with actual student learning. Don provides practical advice for parents to use learning outcomes as discussion anchors in parent-teacher meetings, positioning outcomes documentation as a transparency and accountability tool. The letter suggests students and parents often lack access to these critical documents, identifying an institutional accountability gap.</div>

<p>Dear Sir:</p>
<p><b>School alignment<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Alignment in education has a number of meanings but for the purpose of this letter I refer to elements of a school system that have a significant bearing on coherence and efficiency. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>three:</p>
<p>Outcomes, according to my definition, are statements of performance expected to occur at some point in a person’s learning.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I see them as part of a contract between a teacher and a student, and each should have a copy.</p>
<p>Curriculum development</p>
<p>Assessment</p>
<p>Reporting student progress</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Fine tuning, replacement of parts</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Examples include:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Alignment specialiats</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>It’s not unusual at this time of year to have our cars checked for alignment; we may not realize it, but school systems also struggle with alignment issues.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>While educators usually think only of curriculum alignment, we need to also check alignment of:</p>
<p>Curriculum</p>
<p>Assessment criteria with those in life outside school</p>
<p>School reporting with specified outcomes</p>
<p>Timetables and individual learning speeds<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Benchmarks and community standards</p>
<p>priorities</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Improving alignment may require changing priorities, rewriting resource material, adding community members to committees, making surveys, If you have concerns about your child’s progress, I suggest that start with the course outcomes, review them first with your child then take them to the parent teacher meeting.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Doing so will help focus the discussion.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In fact, sometimes copies of relevant outcomes are given to each student as part of the orientation process at the beginning of each new course.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If not, they are readily available on the website of the Department of Education</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p><br></p>
