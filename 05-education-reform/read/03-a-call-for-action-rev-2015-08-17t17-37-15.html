	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Preparation
	for life’s roles is called education and the better prepared we
	are the better we are able to cope with all that we encounter, or
	create.  Educating is a complex matter made so by the fact that each
	person is unique in many ways, unique in basic physical, mental,
	emotional make-up; unique in the range and nature of previous
	experience, unique in perceived futures, but also unique in terms of
	learning pace, style and needs.  Education is often described as any
	experience that has a formative effect on the way we think, feel or
	act; it may also be thought of as what we can do with what we have
	learned.</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">It
	is widely recognized that education is a key factor in determining
	each citizen’s quality of life; in the same way, the collective
	education of our citizens will determine to a significant degree the
	quality of the communities in which we live.  In recognition of its
	importance, governments provide massive support for public
	education. The investment is justified for two reasons, one to
	ensure a high level of personal growth and development for every
	citizen; the other is to ensure the common good. 
	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Based
	on media reports over the past few months, one can conclude that
	there is a gap between what Islanders have and what they want in the
	way of education. Literacy levels alone have come to the fore
	through <span lang="en-US">PISA
	results, recent CFPEI survey of Island youth, presentation to the
	Standing Committee by the Charlottetown Area Chamber of Commerce, 
	views expressed by the Summerside Chamber of Commerce, a 2014 survey
	by the PEI Home and School Federation and a series of workshops on
	Preparedness held throughout PEI by Education 20/20 Inc.  </span>
	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Indicators
	of the gap include: the limited engagement between educators and the
	community they serve; the lack of a philosophy of education that
	encompasses all our citizens; government’s focus on the young and
	schooling; service gaps such as the availability of part time
	instruction; politicization of decision making, and limits on
	professional autonomy and accountability. Citizens see most of the
	issues as organizational, created by government decision-makers and,
	therefore, capable of being changed by those same government
	decision-makers.

	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">In
	recent years, Prince Edward Island has instituted a number of
	initiatives to improve education including new and upgraded
	facilities, additional investment in technology, the East Prince
	trade and technology centre, embedded professional development (PD)
	days, but much more needs to be done.  It is our view that the
	impact of these changes has been blunted by an outdated delivery
	organization and, in support of this view, we recommend that PEI:</p>

	<ol>
		<li><p style="orphans: 2; margin-bottom: 0in; widows: 2; line-height: 100%">
		<b>Develop
		a “clear and compelling” vision of education for all Islanders.</b>
		 Although much has been written about education, a comprehensive
		vision statement does not currently exist for PEI. We believe that
		having such a statement is required, especially for a service as
		large and complex as education, however, we are not suggesting
		another study but rather a document prepared by a small working
		with opportunity for citizen input.</p></li>

		<li><p style="orphans: 2; margin-bottom: 0in; widows: 2; line-height: 100%">
		<b>Develop
		a learner centered service model that provides support in all
		domains to learners as, when and where needed.</b>
		 Doing so would involve student centered outcomes, criterion
		referenced assessment, flexible scheduling, challenge for credit
		arrangements, and greater autonomy and accountability for teachers.

		<b>Assume
		a leadership role in creating a learning culture and providing a
		quality education for every Islander.</b>
		 Government should focus on matters of planning, setting
		priorities, funding, monitoring, and quality control, ensuring the
		availability of professional resources, home support for preschool

		<b>Delegate

		The actual provision of instruction should be expanded beyond

		<b>Establish
		a qualification body for the purpose certifying individual levels
		of achievement to persons wanting or needing such documentation.</b>
		 The role of teachers is to help others learn; when teachers rank
		their students they are putting their ability to teach at risk.
		Assigning student grades, selecting students for prizes and awards
		and awarding diplomas and degrees is a sorting process and should
		not be part of a teacher’s role.  Apprenticeship with
		certification through a Provincial Department of Labour and music
		through the Royal Canadian Music Conservatory are examples of the
		recommended arrangement.</p></li>
