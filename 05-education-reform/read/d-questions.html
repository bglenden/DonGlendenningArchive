  D Questions
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Don raises fundamental questions teachers cannot adequately answer: How can a student graduate unable to read? He distinguishes schooling from education and notes communication problems in school reporting. Report cards describe what was taught (subjects/grades) rather than what was learned (reading ability, writing skills, social competence). He critiques vague rating scales (A/B/C) undefined outside school contexts. He argues these communication gaps obscure actual learning and calls for improved reporting mechanisms aligned with learner outcomes. This piece demonstrates his attention to communication clarity and practical feedback systems.</div>

<p>Dear Sir:</p>
<p><b>School Questions</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Recently, but on separate occasions, I was asked questions that I could not answer.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They were not idle questions and are likely in the minds of others, so I decided to make them public.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The first question was “How come a student can graduate and not be able to read?”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Because I do not have details about the student in question, I’ll restate the question.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>d itknow about the case to It is not a new question but I’ve heard similar questions aabout reading beforethe question beforeconcern about reading is widespreadThe first was about a student who had graduated from high school and could not<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>readhear many complaints about education.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Some, I believe, may be blamed on poor communication.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Let me elaborate.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>We speak of schooling and education as though they are the same thing; in fact, they are not.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We speak of school buildings, school years, school days, school teachers, school books, school buses and school report cards.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>To be consistent, in terms of improvement, we should limit our focus to schools. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Report cards also cause of communication problems.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Parents want information about what their child has learned; report cards focus on what has been taught or studied.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The questions parents ask are quite specific.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>How well can he read?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Write? Get along with others? The answers tend to be broad.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He got an A in English, a B in History and a C in music.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Rating levels need definition; they are at odds with rating swcales used in life outside school.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I cannot ever remember anyone ever referring to a colleague or coworker as an A, B or C.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When we say a person is an A student or a B student, what do we mean?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>How do we describe the difference between a student with an “A” and one with a “B”?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I can think of at least three possibilities.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A student could be given an A because he or she has much broader information about a subject than the B student.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>On the other hand, a student may be given an A because he is able to complete assignments more quickly, to a higher standard and with less assistance from fellow students or teachers.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Or has an A student actually reached a higher level of learning and is able to analyze or problem solve rather than simply identify and report? <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Improving communication with learners, parents and even the general public, would, I suggest, be a useful first step in improving school performance.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
<p><br></p>
