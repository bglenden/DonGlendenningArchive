  21-2 RESTRUCTURING
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Comprehensive working draft proposing PEI education restructuring. Don defines education as umbrella concept encompassing all learning experiences, distinguishing it from schooling. References calls for reform from PEI trustees, OECD (2011), World Bank (2018), Montreal Economic Institute, UNESCO, Education 2020 Inc. (2015), and educators. Identifies problems: government&#x27;s narrow vision conflating education with schooling, political system embedment limiting flexibility. Proposes solutions including independent qualification service, chief educator role, micro-credit system, government-funded education service identification, individual profiles, Department role redesign, and PEI Education Association. Advocates for Legislative committee educational overhaul.</div>

<p><b>RESTRUCTURING EDUCATION</b></p>
<p><b>21-2</b></p>
<p>Education is an umbrella word and includes all learning experiences wherever, whenever and however initiated, carried out or paid for.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Becoming more educated, results in changes in the way a person thinks, feels or acts.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Being educated has been described as a state or level of development that allows a person to “adequately cope with all demands of daily life”.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Education is a provincial responsibility; typical services include: governance and leadership, funding, instruction, human resources, products and technology, quality assurance and Information and counselling. Provinces generally group clients by age and direct deliver services to them.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

Educational documents have an ambiguity that interferes with communication;<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The Department’s goal<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>of developing and delivering high quality programs and curriculum to Island children sis an example and , in fact, the least clea among those I examined.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Calls for change are not new. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I first heard about structural impediments in the education system a few years ago from a PEI trustee. Then in 2011, the OECD recommended more autonomy to schools for their day- to- day operation as a way to improve PISA test results. in 2018, the World Bank, the largest funder of educational services, spoke about improving an education system by delegating certain operational practices to schools and intermediary bodies.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Montreal Economic Institute reported that autonomy and accountability “jointly applied” are key factors in school achievement”. and just a few weeks ago, a friend forwarded information from UNESCO about the structure of educational services.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And that’s not to forget a “Call for Action” by Education 2020 Inc. in 2015, newspaper items and the many comments from retired educators and Island citizens at large. And I’ve encountered the “fear factor’	</p>

<p><br></p>
<p>It’s time for an overhaul</p>

<p>Press releases suggest that of operating schools not leading an education system. My impression is that I sense also that Department goals The vision of what constitutes <span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>education seems to have changed from a service to a product; Department information releases focus on school rather than education, gone are two stalwarts, PVI and PCVHS, “non-academic courses and options are no longer delivered by the Department of Education, offerings for personal interest and evelopment appear to be down, <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>conversation, fear factor, federal gove no longer an advocate</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The problem. as I see it, is two- fold. (1) Government has adopted a narrow vision as to what constitutes education confusing it with school studies and (2) simply folded it into existing government<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>folded the bundle into a political body. confused it with running schools, and delivered it with military precision. We need to go back to the drawing board.</p>
<p>An overhaul is in order: seems like a perfect role for<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>the Legislative committee on Education.</p>

<p><br></p>
<p>Education may be self-initiated or arranged by others. It is said that the most important part of ones educational experiences are those initiated through the home before we even start school. Although the education system focuses on traditional subjects of study my inclination is to focus on practices drawn from real life and considered essential</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>. Many suggest that service is no longer the focus. students are simply looking for the piece of paper, the<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“pass”, the credit, diploma or degree.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>1.	Establish an independent qualification service</p>
<p>2.	Develop a chief educator role equivalent to that of the chief health officer</p>
<p>3.	Establish a micro-credit system</p>
<p>4.	Identify education services for which government will pay</p>
<p>5.	Individual profiles</p>
<p>6.	Adopt new role for Department</p>
<p>7.	Encourage a PEI Education Association</p>
