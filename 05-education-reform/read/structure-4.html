  Structure 4 
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Brief organizational analysis of education service structure, likely part of a larger series of documents examining PEI education system design. Don critiques that PEI&#x27;s structure does not reflect all services at senior levels, functions are not clearly identified, and organizational form does not follow function. Notes that school autonomy and public accountability are important, and that restricted information flow may result from embedding education in government. Reflects his systems-thinking approach to institutional design.</div>

<p><b>STRUCTURE- 4</b></p>
<p>An organization’s structure outlines how activities are to be directed to achieve goals, roles and responsibilities. While organizations may take many forms, service organizations, like education, are usual local or decentralized giving representatives freedom to respond to individual and local demands. Typical education services include: governance, instruction, assessment, products and technology, information and counselling, human resources, administration and finance; it is likely that main services will be represented a senior levels of the organization. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
