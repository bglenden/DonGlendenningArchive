  D-8-2 Qualification @2015-09-07T02;14;11
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Occasional paper proposing establishment of a Canadian qualification framework and independent qualification authority to facilitate labour mobility and distinguish between credentials (institutional credentials for course completion) and qualifications (demonstrated competency in performing tasks). Glendenning advocates for separating teaching/formative assessment from certification/summative assessment, citing examples like apprenticeship and music conservatory models that successfully operate independently of educational institutions.</div>

<p><b><i>A 	Qualification Framework</i></b></p>
<p><b><i></i></b><br></p>
<p>Occasional Paper D-8	 <span class="Apple-converted-space">                       			                             </span>September 5, 2015</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>	</b></p>
<p>Labour mobility is a fact of life; our ancestors practiced it, so have most of us.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The difference is that, jobs have become more complex, numbers have increased, the pace has quickened and people travel further afield.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Labour mobility is an important contributor to our economy and refers to the movement of people from job to job, occupation to occupation and from one geographical location to another. While many provinces experience high migrant and immigrant labour mobility,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Prince Edward Island’s mobility pattern of interprovincial migrants from within Canada is one of the lowest. Examples include the regular commute of Islanders between their home in PEI and their workplace in Alberta, retraining needed when a plant closes, and young people moving to gain further education or enter employment.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Labour mobility may be hampered by geographic ties, absence of housing, unemployment benefits, licensing requirements, lack of portable qualifications, and lack of recognized educational levels; the latter, educational levels, is the subject of this paper.</p>
<p><b>To facilitate the movement of workers, both within a country and internationally, many countries have developed a qualification framework and a qualification authority to enforce it; Canada and the US are exceptions. Qualification authorities operate under government legislation but often have their own governing structure.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>While the nature of their work varies from country to county, qualification authorities usually perform direct assessments of individuals, including setting, preparing and marking examinations; identifying levels of competence in an occupation or field, setting standards and benchmarks; maintaining a databank, translating qualification documents; liaising with schools and training institutions on assessment practices, issuing licenses and certificates and providing a recognized service for people with overseas qualifications.</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>he lack of a qualification framework leaves Canada with a patchwork of institution based credentialing arrangements.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Educational institutions award credentials (diplomas and degrees) to people who have successfully completed a prescribed number and pattern of courses. Institutions at all levels are conscious of mobility patterns of students and go to considerable lengths to ensure courses and programs are described carefully in terms of outcomes, objectives, time, facilities and qualified staff, and, in fact, will accept credits from other institutions as though they were their own. On the other hand, a qualification is quite different in that it attests to the fact that the holder has demonstrated the attitudes, skills and knowledge required to successfully perform in a role or at a task in a work setting.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Hence we argue that there is a significant difference between the two where the credential implies that the holder knows something whereas a qualification is an actual measure of what the holder can do with what he or she knows.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In actual fact, many people with credentials may be as well qualified or even better qualified than those without but do not have the papers to prove it.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Given the absence of a Canadian qualification authority, employers and certification bodies use credentials in their place; their<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>reliability is limited, however, due to the large number of issuing organizations, that they are based on input rather than output measures ( time and content studied), are based primarily on knowledge, emphasize what has been studied rather than what has been learned.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Social promotion or passing is a prime example of their declining value.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>One exception is apprenticeship (a provincial responsibility) where Provinces have found a way to both honour the jurisdictional boundaries and produce a qualification document recognized across the country.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This has been accomplished through common analyses, both provincial and national examinations and an endorsement known as the Red Seal.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Other exceptions include the work of the Royal Canadian Conservatory of Music, Canadian Red Cross, Canadian Swimming.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>We propose the establishment of a Canadian qualification framework and an independent body to run it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Such an authority would assess and certify a person’s level of performance on a task or set of tasks such as found in an occupation or field of study. For example, a qualifications authority would reduce, if not eliminate, the confusion between (a) teaching where teachers employ formative assessment practices to promote student learning and (b) sorting students through summative assessment practices. The qualifications authority would focus certification more clearly on performance that matters support lifelong learning, and self-directed study and thereby allow schools to focus on formative assessment practices that serve to help students learn. A qualification authority would, in effect, serve two clients, organizations (i.e., employers) desiring an assessment of prospective employees and individuals wanting to confirm the level and suitability of their qualifications. While qualification authorities we are familiar with, focus on approving courses, accrediting institutions, and analyzing current offerings; we believe in a qualification authority that assesses individuals directly, not one that massages the minutiae of hours, outcomes, teacher qualification of education providers. A qualification authority could also play a useful role in helping people identify gaps in their preparation for a given field of work. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>We support a qualification authority that is independent with its own governing structure, accepts clients on direct application or by referral and issues certificates as appropriate based on demonstrated performance. Additionally, the authority could (on request) provide applicants with information on learning gaps in certification requirements. A qualification authority would not, however, organize competitions, rank students, or grant credentials. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>A review of the literature supports the value of a qualification framework. Benefits include easing the assessment burden on teachers and the school system, improving the consistency in reporting, serve as a n agency to evaluate foreign credentials, easing the mobility process, improving communications between and among education stakeholders, encouraging self- study and reducing the incidence of grade inflation.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>As a final note on the subject, a note on the jurisdictional issue of education may be in order.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There is no doubt that education in Canada is a Provincial responsibility; we would argue, however, that the awarding of qualifications is separate process and not part of education.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>his leaves open the issue of who whould award qualifications among the any level of government,the ptovste sectorquestion of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
