  Quality Education 3
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Extensive framework for quality education systems prepared for Education 20/20 Inc. Defines education, education system, and quality. Discusses two philosophical approaches: humanist/progressive (emphasizing whole-child development and social change) and economist (emphasizing efficiency and outcomes). Details quality education characteristics: healthy learners, safe environments, relevant content, outcomes linked to objectives, learner-focused support, timely/independent information, professional/autonomous/accountable teachers. Includes substantial section on criterion-referenced assessment, quality assurance frameworks, and recommendations from OECD and UNICEF. Extensive discussion of internal/external evaluation, quality management, and tertiary education specific guidance. Shows Don&#x27;s deep engagement with contemporary quality assurance theory.

<p><span><b>Education - a</b></span>ny and all experiences that have a formative effect on a person’s attitude, knowledge or skill.</p>
<p><span><b>Education system</b></span><b> – </b>a set of formal and informal<b> </b>institutions, programs and services provided and encouraged by or with the approval of a provincial government<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>for the delivery education to any and all its citizens.</p>
<p><b>Quality - </b>– fitness for purpose</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The paper starts by differentiating education from schools and argues that any framework to conceptualize educational quality is necessarily value-based.</p>

<p>The paper starts by differentiating education from schools and argues that any framework to conceptualize educational quality is necessarily value-based. Two broad approaches to understanding quality are then outlined in Part 2 and a selection of key texts reviewed that falls into each approach. The humanist/progressive approach is characterised by a broad concern for the development of the whole child and human development or social change. The second broad approach, the economist approach, is largely concerned with efficiency and effectiveness, and the achievement of learning outcomes at reasonable cost. Learning outcomes tend to be narrowly defined in terms of cognitive achievement. This approach is identified with the World Bank and two key Bank publications are reviewed.</p>

<p><br></p>
<p><b>ASSESSMENT THAT IS CRITERION REFERENCED</b></p>
<p>Bot terms coned by Robert Glaser</p>
<p>There are two approaches to testing:</p>
<p>Criterion referenced- answer is correct; A criterion-referenced test would report the student's performance strictly according to whether the individual student correctly answered these questions; A criterion-referenced test will use questions which were correctly answered by students who know the specific material.</p>
<p>A <b>criterion-referenced test</b> is one that provides for translating test scores into a statement about the behavior to be expected of a person with that score or their relationship to a specified subject matter. Most tests and quizzes that are written by school teachers can be considered criterion-referenced tests. The objective is simply to see whether the student has learned the material. Criterion-referenced assessment can be contrasted with norm-referenced assessment and ipsative assessment.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Norm referenced – better than student A but not as good as student B; a norm-referenced test indicates whether the test-taker did better or worse than other people who took the test</p>
<p>Definition of <i>criterion</i>[edit]</p>
<p>A common misunderstanding regarding the term is the meaning of <i>criterion</i>. Many, if not most, criterion-referenced tests involve a cutscore, where the examinee passes if their score exceeds the cutscore and fails if it does not (often called a mastery test). The <i>criterion</i> is not the cutscore; the criterion is the domain of subject matter that the test is designed to assess. For example, the criterion may be "Students should be able to correctly add two single-digit numbers," and the cutscore may be that students should correctly answer a minimum of 80% of the questions to pass.</p>
<p>The criterion-referenced interpretation of a test score identifies the relationship to the subject matter. In the case of a mastery test, this does mean identifying whether the examinee has "mastered" a specified level of the subject matter by comparing their score to the cutscore. However, not all criterion-referenced tests have a cutscore, and the score can simply refer to a person's standing on the subject domain.<span><sup>[2]</sup></span> The ACT is an example of this; there is no cutscore, it simply is an assessment of the student's knowledge of high-school level subject matter.</p>

<p><b>WHY QUALITY MATTERS</b></p>
<p><span></span>Improved quality assurance could help countries achieve their goal of ensuring high quality provision in tertiary education and preparing their populations for participation in the knowledge economy<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><span></span>The transition from elite to mass participation in tertiary education has increased the burden on national budgets<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><span></span>The move towards the New Public Management (NPM) approach requires policy makers to demonstrate the effectiveness of public spending<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><span></span>Governments have agreed to provide more autonomy to tertiary education institutions (TEIs) so as to improve TEIs’ central management in exchange for quality assurance<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><span></span>New private educational offerings have called for better protection of consumers<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><span></span>Quality provision in TEIs is important to attract students and secure revenues in competitive environments<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><span></span>The role of tertiary education in training knowledge workers contributes to economic growth<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><span></span>Ensuring quality in tertiary education beyond the elite segment is also important for employment and social cohesion<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><span></span>The shift towards the new economy has increased students and employers’ expectations of tertiary education<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><span></span>The growing internationalisation of tertiary education calls for a closer monitoring of cross-border education quality<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><span></span>Quality assurance can be defined as the “process of establishing stakeholder confidence that provision (input, process and outcomes) fulfils expectations and measures up to threshold minimum requirements”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p><br></p>
<p><b>DESIGN OF THE QUALITY ASSURANCE FRAMEWORK<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><span></span>Design a quality assurance framework consistent with the goals of tertiary education whereby:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p> each student is provided with quality education<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p> the overall system is contributing to the social and economic development of the country<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p> TEIs’ activities foster equity of access and outcomes<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p> quality assurance contributes to a better co-ordination within and integration of the overall tertiary system<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><span></span>Build consensus on clear goals and expectations of the quality assurance system<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p> distinguish improvement and accountability conceptually and practically, while allowing for close contact between them<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><span></span>Ensure that quality assurance serves both the improvement and accountability purposes<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><span></span>Combine internal and external quality assurance mechanisms<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><span></span>Build capacity and secure legitimacy<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p> collection of data and processing of quality indicators to be used in accountability checks should ideally be developed outside the quality assurance agency/body<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p> ensure that the staff involved in external evaluations are adequately selected and trained to analyse the information gathered during the evaluations<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><span></span>Make stakeholders such as students, graduates and employers visible in the evaluation procedures<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><span></span>Increase focus on student outcomes<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p> refer to the desired outcomes of tertiary education for the design of tertiary programmes’ curricula<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p> develop indicators of teaching quality and include them in performance appraisals of TEIs<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><span></span>Enhance the international comparability of the quality assurance framework<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><i>Directorate for Education, Education and Training Policy Division September 2008<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></i></p>
<p><b>INTERNAL EVALUATION<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><span></span>Develop a strong quality culture in the system<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><span></span>Put more stress on internal quality assurance mechanisms<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p> academics in each study area could gather systematic feedback from students, assess their programme’s effectiveness and carry out improvements in areas where weaknesses are identified<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p> national quality assurance agency/body could organise technical assistance materials and sponsor workshops<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><span></span>Ensure that internal accountability is guided by some key principles<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p> encourage peer observation of teaching<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><span></span>Undertake the external validation of internal quality assurance systems<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>EXTERNAL EVALUATION<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><span></span>Commit external quality assurance to an advisory role as the system gains maturity but retain strong external components in certain contexts<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p> external quality assurance could offer advice and consultation to TEIs, undertake research on quality, disseminate best practices and provide benchmarking data across the sector<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p> concentrate monitoring and improvement efforts on TEIs most in need of improving their quality<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><span></span>Implement adequate follow-up procedures and view quality assurance as a continuous process<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p> the quality assurance agency/body should step in when a TEI does not act on the evaluation recommendations<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><span></span>Allow for selected assessments to be initiated by an external quality assurance agency<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><span></span>Avoid direct links between assessment results and public funding decisions<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p> minimum quality thresholds should be demonstrated <i>ex-ante </i>to become eligible for public funds<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p> find balance between reward mechanisms and funding directed to correct deficiencies in low-performing TEIs<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b><i>METHODS<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></i></b></p>
<p><span></span>Align quality assurance processes to the particular profile of TEIs<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><span></span>Improve co-ordination between the evaluation of teaching and research<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><span></span>Engage in constant innovation, e.g. periodic change in both objectives and in the quality assurance agencies<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><span></span>Develop quality assurance expertise in new areas<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>PRACTICAL ARRANGEMENTS FOR THE QUALITY ASSURANCE SYSTEM<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><span></span>Avoid fragmentation of the quality assurance organisational structure<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><span></span>Avoid excessive costs and burdens<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><span></span>Improve quality information base<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p> build a better national information system on tertiary students and their later employment experience<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
