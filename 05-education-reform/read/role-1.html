  Role 1
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Letter proposing that the Department of Education&#x27;s role should be updated from &quot;developing and delivering curriculum&quot; to &quot;promoting, encouraging and regulating&quot; education. Don advocates separating oversight from operations—as the Department of Health does with Health PEI—allowing departments to focus on regulation while delegating operations to schools, colleges, and universities. He sees this as essential to shifting focus from schools to education broadly.</div>

<div class="reader-content">
<p>Dear Editor:</p>
<p>The role of Government in education should be updated.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>At the moment, the role of our Department of Education is described as “developing and delivering curriculum” to youth; that’s very narrow, indeed. A more adequate description would<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>be to “promote, encourage and regulate” education services.</p>
<p>But even more, the literature says that “oversight and delivery” of education services should be separated. Our Department of Health accomplishes this through dividing responsibilities between the Department and Health PEI. The education literature makes a different suggestion, that of having Departments provide oversight and delegating “operations” to schools. The latter reflects current arrangements for colleges and universities.</p>
<p>Doing so would change the focus from schools to education and be a major step in the education improvement process.</p>
<p>Sincely</p>
<p>Don Glendenning</p>
