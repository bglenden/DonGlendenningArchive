  Guardian-Reading-proposal
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">This August 16, 2012 proposal is directed to The Guardian newspaper, soliciting a $4,000 grant for Education First Canada&#x27;s Reading Engagement Project. The organization, newly incorporated as a non-aligned national body focused on quality education, proposes workshops on reading-related matters including outcomes, competencies, learning materials, and teaching strategies. Don requests funding for research assistance ($2,500) and facility rental for ten meetings ($1,500). The proposal demonstrates Don&#x27;s early education reform efforts before Education 20/20 Inc.&#x27;s formation and his strategic focus on reading as the foundational literacy skill. The letter references endorsement by the Community Foundation of PEI, showing early partnership development.</div>

<p><br></p>
<p><b>Description of how project relates to education and literacy:</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>Reading is the basic skill of literacy and certainly the “golden skill” of education. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In our discussions about the improvement of public education, reading achievement/performance topped the list of concerns: Education First Canada decided, therefore, to make reading a priority.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We believe that improving reading requires the involvement of all stakeholders.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We propose, therefore, to convene a number of workshops focused on reading-related matters such as outcomes/competencies, learning materials, performance criteria, teaching strategies, rating scales and reporting.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Bringing stake holders and providers together on neutral ground is a natural role for an unaligned organization such as Education First Canada.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>While we could use funds for many useful purposes, the following are the most pressing for Education First Canada at this time:</p>
<p><br></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li5">While the participants themselves will bring much to discussions, there will also be a need to gather, copy, distribute data and information as background and support.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We would like, therefore, to contract with someone or ones who, under direction, will search for information between meetings.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My own reading, for instance, has turned up statistics on literacy but few on reading, little in the way of competencies/outcomes, competency based rating scales, performance levels, benchmarks, or costs.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The same could be said for information about best teaching practices , weaknesses in our current approach and others.<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Perhaps we can find a retiree, a teacher, or even a student teacher in training to help.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We are projecting a cost for this item of $2,500.</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li5">While we are grateful to the organizations that have provided meeting space either free or at a minimum charge, the arrangement does not allow us to book space with either certainty or continuity; booking a room for group meetings and breakouts, projection capability, flip charts, etc.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Securing facilities, it seems, requires more time than preparing the program; meetings also often require photocopying, supplies and other support. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We would like, for example, to be able to book a room every two weeks between now and Christmas, a room that could accommodate 25-30 people.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Although we want to engage people across the Island, at the moment, we are holding most of our discussions in the Charlottetown area; convenience to the downtown area and parking are important considerations.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The estimated cost of facilities for ten meetings, including tax, is $1,500.</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Please provide a breakdown of how the funding will be used:</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>1	Admin/research assistance to gather, copy and distribute<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>information, as required: $2,500</p>
<p>2 	Room and support facilities for 10 half day meetings plus tax at $150:		 $1,500</p>
<p>	</p>
<p>							Total:					$4,000</p>
