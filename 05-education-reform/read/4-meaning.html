  4-Meaning
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Don notes that PEI education literature lacks a clear definition of education, despite its importance to thinking and communication clarity. He surveys definitions from multiple sources (Good - social process; OECD - organic communication; Anonymous - formative experience; Ontario - act of teaching/receiving). He critiques being asked &quot;where he got his education&quot; as reflecting product thinking and references the World Bank&#x27;s caution about confusing education with schooling. The piece advocates for PEI establishing its own clear definition to enhance precision and avoid misunderstanding.</div>

<p>MEANING OF EDUCATION</p>
<p>	 					<span class="Apple-converted-space">                             	             </span>D-22--MEANING<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p>Prince Edward Island needs a definition of education; perhaps more accurately, Islanders need to know how the PEI education system defines education. My reading of the PEI literature and search at CAMET, CMEC and CEA did not reveal one. Whether we agree or not, just knowing will help us to think and communicate more clearly. , to avoid misunderstanding and to understand the people we serve, the services we provide, product, process and values. is is specially so when the subject itself caries layers of subjectivity. The absence of definitions<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>may signify differences of opinion as to Education’s meaning and mission.The process of assigning meaning enhances both precision and clarity.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The education literature describes education as follows:</p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li1">Good – the social process by which people are subjected to the influence of a selected and controlled environment so that they may attain social competence and optimum individual development</li>
  <li class="li1">OECD – organic and sustained communication to bring about learning</li>
  <li class="li1">Anon - any experience that has a formative effect on the way a person thinks feels or acts.</li>
  <li class="li1">Ontario – both the act of teaching knowledge to others and the act of receiving knowledge from someone else.</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>I’ve been asked by a senior educator where I got my education; that implies education as a product rather than a process. . . The World Bank cautions countries about confusing education and “going to school.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
