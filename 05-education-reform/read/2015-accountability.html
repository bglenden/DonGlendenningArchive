  2015 Accountability
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Don examines the Department of Education website to analyze accountability structures. He finds the Minister&#x27;s role clearly defined (defines, provides, assesses, establishes, approves, prohibits) while the Deputy Minister and Superintendent lack clear function descriptions, principals exercise vague &quot;leadership&quot; responsibilities, and teachers&#x27; instructional roles are undefined. He concludes the organization is &quot;out of sync&quot; with form and function misaligned, issues parachuted up to ministerial decision-making, and focus absent from accomplishment.</div>

<p>Dear Sir:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><b>Accountability in education</b></p>
<p>The issue of accountability often arises when speaking of education, so I decided to see what the Department of Education website says about what key decision-makers do; here is what I found:</p>
<p>The Minister defines, provides, assesses, establishes, approves and even prohibits – all actions are do-able, clear, concise, and measurable.</p>
<p>The Deputy Minister is responsible for many things but, at least according to the website, doesn’t really do much.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The ELSB Superintendent doesn’t seem to do much either although she does play a role in formulating and executing a Strategic Plan, promotes a culture of excellence and is responsible for a number of things</p>
<p>School principals “exercise leadership supervisory and administrative responsibilities”</p>
<p>Since teachers must hold an instructional license we can assume that they instruct but I cannot find a description.</p>
<p>The above findings, unscientific as they are, point to an organization where form and function are likely out of sync, issues are parachuted up to the Minister for decisions and there’s not a lot of focus on accomplishment.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Comforting for people wanting cover but frustrating for dedicated professionals.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p><br></p>

<p>A long-time student of education</p>
