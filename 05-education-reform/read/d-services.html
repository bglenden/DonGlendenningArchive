<div class="reader-summary">Brief letter to editor (D-22-03) on &quot;Typical Education Services.&quot; Don defines education as a set of services helping people learn, including information, counselling, instruction, feedback, learning guides, learning products, technology, funding, and human resources. Notes services are seldom mentioned in education literature. Critiques Department lumping all services under &quot;schools&quot; and argues services should be available to homeschooled, part-time, and independent learners—distinguishing an education system from a school system.</div>

<p>Typical Education Services</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Education is a service, or perhaps more accurately, a set of service intended help people learn. Typical services include Information, counselling, instruction, feedback, learning guides, learning products, technology, funding, and human resources.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Surprisingly, services are seldom mentioned in the education literature</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Department literature lumps services together under “schools”. Since learners can learn most anywhere, the writer is of the view that services should be available to home schooled, part time and independent learners as well. It is one of the characteristics that differentiates an education system <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>from a school system</p>
