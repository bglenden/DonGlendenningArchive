  D New Model of Education
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Don proposes operating principles for education systems: all students should meet graduation requirements, principals should be instructional leaders, exit standards must be measurable/attainable/relevant, time should adapt to student learning styles, reports should include skills development, programs should be individualized per resources, family education advisors should be available, and students should challenge courses for credit. He argues these principles create clarity for operational decisions. This letter presents a systematic framework for education design and demonstrates his ability to distill complex philosophy into actionable principles.</div>

<p>Dear Sir:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Review in order</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Education is important.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In recognition of this, the Government of PEI has recently made substantial investments in education at all levels.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A drive past Holland College and UPEI, and throughout the countryside provides evidence government support.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Buildings are a visible response to providing a quality education; there is also a need to improve the model of delivery. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>There are many places to start, one suggestion is a set of operating principles.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>On any such list, I would include the following:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Every student entering the system should expect to meet graduation requirements</p>
<p>Principals are expected to be instructional leaders<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Exit standards shall be measurable, attainable and relevant.</p>
<p>Time available to meet standards may be adjusted to meet individual student learning styles and needs.</p>
<p>Performance reports to students and parents will include skills as well as subjects.</p>
<p>Programs will be individualized to the extent that resources allow.</p>
<p>The services of a family education advisor will be made available<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Students will be allowed to challenge any course or subject for credit.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Wit such a list in hand, deciosions about operational changes, if any, will be relatively easy.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
<p><br></p>
