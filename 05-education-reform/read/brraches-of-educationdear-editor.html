  Brraches of educationDear Editor
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Returning to a core concern, Don revisits departmental structure, organizing his critique around the concept of &quot;branches&quot; or divisions. Comparing PEI to other departments: Agriculture structures around crops, animals, potatoes; Health around COVID, drugs, e-health, hospitals; Fisheries around angling, hunting, wildlife, trapping. PEI Education, however, organizes by levels (elementary, secondary, postsecondary) rather than branches of educational endeavor. Education creates experiences through which people develop knowledge, skills, attitudes, attributes—enabling language learning, road building, community thriving, health services, artistic creation. Schools should organize education; so should the Department leading them. The letter, despite a typo in the filename (&quot;Brraches&quot;), represents mature expression of Don&#x27;s consistent message: departmental structure must reflect educational services and human development outcomes rather than institutional hierarchy. This final letter synthesizes his multi-year advocacy into a clear organizational principle.</div>

<p>Dear Editor:</p>
<p>A Education Puzzler</p>
<p>A friend of mine has a habit of referring to something that he does not understand as a “puzzler”; my puzzler is about branches or divisions of education.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>I raise this matter because of<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>a recent scan of Department of Education literature. PEI Government Departments are structured to reflect branches or fields of endeavour. Agriculture includes land, crops, animals and potatoes; Health reflects Covid, drugs, E-Health and hospitals; Fisheries includes angling, hunting, wildlife and trapping. Education, on the other hand. reveals levels of study – elementary, secondary and postsecondary studies.</p>
<p>Education is about creating experiences through which people change or increase knowledge, skills attitudes or other attributes. As a result of these experiences people can speak another language, build and maintain roads, thrive in their chosen community, provide health serv ices to others and both create and enjoy artistic pieces of art. The organization of schools focuses on education; so should the Department that leads them.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
<p>Don Glendenning</p>
