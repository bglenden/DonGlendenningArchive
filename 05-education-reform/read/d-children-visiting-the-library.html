  D Children visiting the library
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Don reflects on observing children and adults at the Confederation Centre library engaged in welcoming, warm reading and storytelling activities. He contrasts this with schools, which he finds less welcoming, requiring children to separate from parents at the school entrance on day one. He proposes that libraries should play a significant role in transitioning young children from home to full-time school. The observation demonstrates his attention to the child&#x27;s emotional experience and institutional welcomingness. The comparison suggests libraries may be more developmentally appropriate for young children&#x27;s introduction to structured learning environments than traditional schools. This reflects his humanistic approach to education.</div>

<p>Dear Sir:</p>
<p><b>Children visiting the library</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>On a couple of occasions last fall, I found myself waiting near door to the Confederation Centre library at opening time.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Also waiting, were several adults with children in tow. <span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>After returning my book, I paused to watch the children.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Children and adults had gathered towards the back of the library and were soon engaged in reading or story telling.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was a very warming and welcoming scene. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The impression I have, confirmed by some mothers, is that schools are much less welcoming.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Children must separate from their parents at the curb, or maybe at the school door even on day one.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>It makes me wonder if libraries shouldn’t play a significant role in the transition of young children from home to full-time school.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
<p><br></p>
