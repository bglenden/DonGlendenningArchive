<p>Dear Editor:</p>
<p><b>The tyranny of time</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I had my car serviced a few days ago; during the process, the mechanic discovered a slight problem, it took longer than expected to fix the problem, but fix it he did before I drove away.</p>
<p>During my last stay in the hospital; the doctor had me stay a couple of days longer than</p>
<p>Expected just to be sure everything was ok. ln fact, completing the job seems to be the motto of most service providers, that is, except schools.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The school system is a time based institution; there is little, if any, flexibility to adjust schedules to serve people needing extra help. Nor is it possible for those who are good at a subject to finish early, or to get a credit and move on to something else. Instead of establishing a standard of performance for each subject, and helping each one reach it, schools allocate time to each subject and measure how much a student has learned in the time available. Students move from subject to subject at the sound of a bell whether or not they have completed their work; that's not the message we should be giving our youth.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Change in our school system is hampered, some might say blocked, by inflexible rules; limited choice, one dominant supplier and front line workers with little freedom or accountability.</p>
<p>Removing these conditions would enable change, but obviously not guarantee it.</p>
<p><br></p>

<p><br></p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
<p><br></p>
