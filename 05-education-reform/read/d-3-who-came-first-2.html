  D-3 who came first-2
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Don reflects on his one-room schoolhouse experience with Christmas and June closing ceremonies where exam results were publicly posted on blackboards. He questions the purpose of ranking students and argues that assessment should improve teaching-learning, not rank performance. He acknowledges not being against awards but believes student ranking interferes with teaching and may not serve educational purposes as supported by literature.</div>

<p>4:</p>
<p>WHO’S ON FIRST?</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I went to a one-room school; we had both a Christmas and June “closing” ceremony to which parents were invited. Part of the decorations for the event was the posting all students names and exam results on one of the blackboards.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>To this day, I wonder why; who needs to know which student came first?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Or last? Teachers? Parents? Trustees,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Department? Community? How did knowing who came first<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>help students? I assume that rating students against each other serves an educational purpose but my scan of the educational literature earlier today revealed no supporting information.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>According to what I read, assessment is used to help the teaching-learning process, to determine level of achievement or to determine class standing. Its only to improve teaching/learning in which teachers should engage. Given that each of us learns at our own rate, and that school time is a constant (at least in most schools)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>it is inevitable that some students will be further ahead and have higher grades every<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>time they are tested?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But is it the major issue we make it to be?</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Now, I am not against prizes and awards; it’s just that I believe that awarding one’s students interferes with teaching; they also may assess to determine performance level.</p>
