<p>Dear Editor:</p>
<p>A context for public education</p>
<p>Education is complex; learners have different interests, capabilities, experiences<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>and needs;<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>we are told about the importance of outcomes, competencies, essential graduation learnings, essential skills but they do not seem to match graduation requirements. We are told that individuals learn<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>at different rates and yet the system is tightly time based..<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We promote lifelong learning but the Department explains its role as one of “developing and delivering high quality programs” to Island youth. Hubs are being established throughout the Island<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>but not by the Department of Education. It’s a bit confusing yo <span>dltaylor@nb.sympatico.ca</span>say the least..<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Public<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>education is a service; typical education services include: governance, instruction, assessment, products and technology, information and counselling, human resources, administration and finance<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Successful service organizations<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>usually organize around services offered and require front line staff to have. significant levels of autonomy.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Leaders of service organizations<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>normally comprise the management team. Departments of education, on the other hand, organize by age of clients- early childhood, kindergarten elementary, secondary and postsecondary – a mismatch to say the least. Successful service organizations require professional workers to have significant levels of autonomy and the OECD tells us that students from schools with autonomy for their day to day operation show better PISA results (OECD, ….)<span class="Apple-converted-space">        </span>Documents and informal conversation suggest<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>that is not the case in PEI. <span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></p>
<p>Critics are quick to blame teachers, teacher unions or government for an underperforming sector.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I disagree what is needed is some simple restructuring instead. And as I’ve said many times, step one is to develop “a clear and compelling vision”.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>My reading file is an inch thick and speaks to me about an overhaul of public education<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>in Manitoba, mini-credentials in the US. women in trades, personal profiles, learner self- rating, holistic rating scales,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“pastoral care”, competencies, curriculum reform in Australia, academic achievement versus growth and Canadian math wars, to name but a few. These are the issues that lead us to better education..</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Educators and politicians like schools but schools, at least in my view, are simply purpose -built places where education takes place, something like a hospital or shopping plaza; we should instead talk of purpose of education, ,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>relevance, assessment, literacy, self care,iinterpersonal relationships and the many other things /conditions that confront people in everyday life.</p>
<p>The confusion, I suggest, are rote in the structure, especially in the higher grades.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I suggest that it is time to review and restate the goal of public education; there are many possibilities. Here are some for consideration:</p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li1"><b>Public education is designed to assist Island residents to develop the essential skills needed by citizens in a democratic society</b></li>
  <li class="li1"><b>Public education is intended to encourage and support Islanders in their quest for further education</b></li>
  <li class="li4"><b>Public education is designed to help Islanders gain attitudes, skills and knowledge needed to flourish in the 21</b><b><sup>st</sup></b><b> century.</b></li>
  <li class="li4"><b></b></li>
</ul>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>PEI should decide<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>why it is spending hundreds of million dollars on education services; the need iis for education; the dialogue suggests it is being spent on schools. The thrust of this letter is simply a plea for clarity of purpose. Otherwise, how can plan programs and measure success?</p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
