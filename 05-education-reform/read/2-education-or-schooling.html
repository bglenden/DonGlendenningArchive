  2 Education or schooling 
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">A published letter (2023) expanding on the critical distinction between education and schooling, citing the World Bank&#x27;s 2018 caution against treating these as equivalent. Don defines education as a broad, lifelong process of acquiring knowledge while developing thinking, creativity, problem-solving, comprehension, and learning capacity, encompassing values, habits, and character development. School, by contrast, is a specific location offering education services, comparable to a hospital as a resource-rich site where teachers and learners meet. Don emphasizes this distinction is not semantic but functional: education is a process; school is a place. This clarity is essential because conflating them limits perception of educational possibilities to institutional settings, constraining community understanding of how learning occurs.</div>

<div class="reader-content">
<p>Dear Editor:</p>
<p><b>Education or Schooling?</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>In its 2018 Report on Education, The World Bank, the largest funder of public education, cautioned Ministries of Education about treating “education and going to school” as though they are one and the same. This is also happening in PEI. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Education is a broad concept; it includes going to school but is certainly not limited to experiences gained in school. Simply put, education is an umbrella term describing the lifelong process of acquiring knowledge; it involves developing the ability to think, create, solve, understand, learn, act and question; it also involves the development of mind and character. Education also deals with manners, values, and building habits.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>A school , on the other hand, is a place that offers education services, perhaps a branch. a<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>stage or a specialty. I also think of it as<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>a place that offers educational services to groups.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is a traditional process of receiving knowledge or even a way to obtain or experience one level or parts of one’s education.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A school, like a hospital, is a resource- rich location where learners and teachers meet to participate in teaching and learning activities.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
