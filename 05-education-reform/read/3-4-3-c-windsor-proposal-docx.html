  3-4-3-C Windsor proposal docx
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Another iteration of the Windsor Foundation proposal, now framed as the &quot;Preparedness Initiative.&quot; Education 20/20 Inc. addresses the foundational issue of low basic education skills in youth, evidenced by PISA results, CFPEI youth surveys, and presentations to the PEI Legislative Assembly. Proposes engaging stakeholders to narrow the preparedness gap for post-secondary study and employment. Identifies three core problems: educational silos (separate systems with poor coordination), curriculum alignment issues, and system inflexibility. Proposes establishing common curriculum maps and reducing inter-institutional fragmentation. Features include creating shared learning maps, single analysis with multiple profiles, separating teaching from assessment functions, and fostering collaborative teacher teams. DACUM methodology and Bloom&#x27;s taxonomy referenced throughout.

<p>Windsor Letter</p>
<p><b>Preparedness initiative</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>INTRODUCTION</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Mission/purpose of organization</b></p>
<p>Education 20/20 Inc. is federally incorporated as an independent, broad based, national, not-for-profit education organization, located in Charlottetown, PEI and is governed by a volunteer Board of Directors.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Our vision is a quality education for every Canadian and mission is to support and strengthen a culture of learning for all Canadians; Education 20/20 Inc. is unique among educational organizations in Canada in that it is unaligned with any educational institutions, grade level, subject field or cause. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The organization operates with ten Directors, a network of some fifty people, and a mailing list of about 250; an application for charitable status has been filed with Canada Revenue Agency; in the meantime, The Community Foundation of Prince Edward Island accepts donations and pays invoices on our behalf. Attached please find a list of activities carried out to date, activities planned for the coming year and a brief biography of our Directors.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Although most Directors have participated in externally funded projects in their other roles, this is the first such project for Education 20/20 Inc. and certainly our first request for funding to the Windsor Foundation.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Issue being addressed</b></p>
<p><span><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The proposal addresses one of the major issues of the day in education, namely the low level of basic education skills demonstrated by young people, including high school graduates.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As evidence I refer to </span>PISA test results for Prince Edward Island; a 2013 survey of issues of Island youth conducted by the Community Foundation; a presentation to a Standing Committee of the PEI Legislative Assembly by the Charlottetown Area chamber of Commerce; How Canada Performs, a Provincial and Territorial Ranking, Education and Training; Education and Skills, and a series of workshops on Preparedness held throughout PEI by Education 20/20 Inc.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The PEI Department of Education has not taken exception to the findings nor, to the best of our knowledge, assumed a leadership role that includes corrective action.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Based on our consultations, a pilot in the area of math has the most likely chance of success.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Proposal<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p>Engage stakeholders in narrowing the gap that young Islanders are experiencing on the way to further study and employment. The attached “one-pager” describes how we arrived at this decision.</p>
<p><b>Relationship to Foundation Priorities</b></p>
<p>The Windsor Foundation has two major areas of interest</p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li6"><b>Disadvantaged or vulnerable youth</b>: These are tough times for young people in transition from public school to further education and to work.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>While there are many causes, this proposal addresses the issue of basic skills, those skills needed to gain entry to the next phase of life and,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>without which many are branded as failures.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We are aware that sometimes this may be the result of poor decisions by<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>students<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>themselves; on the other hand, we are also aware that the gap may from incorrect information, biased counselling, streaming, out dated course content, poor teaching, inflexible scheduling, lack of encouragement and mentoring, and the list goes on. We believe that our proposal will help.</li>
  <li class="li6"><b>Higher education initiatives:</b> Although not as well<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>documented, we’ve also been made aware<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>of the many young people now in college and university who struggle with their studies because of low level of basic skills and I have actually visited them in their make-up classes at Holland College and other adult upgrading programs scattered throughout PEI.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Although we do not have the actual figures, we know that the duplication of services is a strain on taxpayer’s dollars.</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>PROGRAM NARRATIVE</b></p>
<p><b>PROBLEM BEING ADDRESSED</b></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li6"><b>Silo practices followed by educators:</b><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The most readily identifiable educational silos on PEI include the public school system, the university, colleges(2), literacy training, continuing education, and the many “NGO” education and training projects.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We find little evidence of coordination in curriculum development, professional development activities, joint projects, etc.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Nobody, it seems, except the Premier has the authority or responsibility to deal with the issue in an integrated way.</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li6"><b>Curriculum alignment:</b><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The second problem is pedagogical and includes curriculum development, assessment, inability or unwillingness to adjust time; we know that students have different interests, different capabilities, prior experiences and learn at different paces yet the education refuses tro adjust one og iits major tools/resources, that of time.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It would seem so simple to peovide a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li6"><b>System inflexibility</b>:<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>adheres rigidly to time periods inflexibility in the lack of a learner focus throughout the system</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>he program has several innovative features including (1) creating a common map to be used by learners and teachers alike so that students and teachers alike have the same view of the process, (2) a single analysis with multiple profiles instead of the disjointed approach of creating a map for each school grade, (3) the view that establishing a student’s level in a field is not a teaching function and, in fact, places the teacher and student in a position of conflict with each other, (4) reducing the “silo” effect of teachers working at difference levels may see themselves as a team. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That whole element is on shaky ground for at least two reasons: (1) Research (See Eight Year Study) show that the rigid pattern of high school graduation is not a predictor if postsecondary success<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>(2) we are of the view that summative assessment is not an education function</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>STEPS/ACTIVITIESTIMELINE:</b></p>
<p>This proposal is focused on confirm the nature and extent of the education gap as perceived and experienced by users of basic education services, namely students, employers, postsecondary institutions and the community at large.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Steps include<span>:</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li5">Establish a steering committee</li>
  <li class="li5">Searching the literature to gather resource materials relevant to the project</li>
  <li class="li5">Fine tuning the analysis, based on the DACUM model.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li5">Prepare a criterion reference rating scale reflective of Bloom’s Taxonomy<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li5">Identify profiles of math skills reflective of gap - citizenship, work entry and entry into postsecondary institutions, profiles on a single analysis. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li5">Establish a benchmark for each profile</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Benefits:</b></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li5">Brings clarification to the issue of basic skills</li>
  <li class="li5">An aid to self study</li>
  <li class="li5">An aid to employers when hiring new employees</li>
  <li class="li5">Improve communications between and among stakeholders<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li5">Improve Demonstrate some components absent from the current educational process</li>
  <li class="li5">Replace some of the existing costs</li>
</ul>
