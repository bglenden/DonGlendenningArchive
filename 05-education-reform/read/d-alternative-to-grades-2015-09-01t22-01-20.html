  D- Alternative to grades  @2015-09-01T22;01;20
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Don argues that traditional grade-level reporting is unreliable for measuring achievement since students within the same grade can vary by 4-8 grade levels in competence. He advocates for defining achievement levels independently of age, pointing to successful models in music conservatory and apprenticeship certification.</div>

<p>Editor,</p>

<p><br></p>
<p>Dear Sir:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I have lost whatever faith I once had in school grades; although widely used, grades are no longer a reliable way, if they ever were, of measuring and describing student achievement. Knowing that your child is in Grade 9, 10 or 11 math tells little of their competence in math; the same applies to other subjects.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I say this because teachers will tell you that students in any Grade have a Grade level spread of 4, 6 or even 8 grade levels. Reporting and comparing schools by number of years spent in school tells little if anything about what has been learned or what a person can do – and yet all Provinces do it.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>It is time, in fact past time, to define achievement levels in subjects in a manner independent of student age and grouping.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The Canadian Conservatory does it for music, Provincial Governments does it for apprentices, most Provinces accept GED tests to establish high school equivalency levels. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>What’s missing is the willingness to consider alternatives.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Don Glendenning</p>
<p>A long-time student of education</p>
