  2015 Role of  government
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Don advocates for updating PEI&#x27;s Philosophy of Education document, noting it is foundational to system decisions but narrowly focused on schools and schooling. He calls for broadened scope to include home and community education across all ages. The letter mentions needed consultation with external facilitators and suggests this update as an appropriate priority for a new premier. The document appears to have formatting issues, suggesting it may be a working draft or outline rather than a finished letter.</div>

<p>Dear Sir:</p>
<p><b>Time to update basic education documents<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Every Islander who is interested in education should take a look at the “Philosophy of Education” found on the website of the Department of Education and Early Childhood Development. It’s a short document and includes a statement of purpose, basic principles, goals and notes about schools in society. It’s a basic document, reflects the beliefs, values and of leaders in the system and provides a basis for decision making.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>It’s a good document but needs to be updated, or refreshed, in also needs to be broadened to reflect all education, that which is provided in the home and community as well as in school, , and education for all ages. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Goals need to be sharpened, perhaps time frames added aout institutionsstrength is tat it is written and a fOur politicians should read itugh labelled<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>a philosophy of education, it is really about schools and schooling.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I found no mention, for instance of continuing measurable</p>
