  D Paying students
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">From September 18, 2010, Don proposes a thought experiment: if school is &quot;work,&quot; should students be paid? He questions the basis for payment (attendance vs. achievement) and proposes tying compensation to accomplishments—credits earned, courses completed, diplomas awarded. He further suggests eliminating attendance requirements entirely, allowing students to challenge any course via examination with a fee, and awarding credit upon success with potential refund as reward. This radical proposal reflects his challenge-for-credit advocacy.</div>

<p>Dear Sir:</p>
<p><b>Paying Students</b><b></b></p>
<p> </p>
<p>We pay people to work and it is often said that going to school is a student’s work.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But if we pay, what should be expected of the student in return?</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Should we pay simply for showing up, for participating in school activities, for attending a set number of hours, for following school rules and not being disruptive?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>At what age or grade level would the practice begin?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Would the pay rate be the same for all?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Under what circumstances would a student be docked pay?</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Given our fixation on grades, courses, credits, diplomas and degrees, another option would be to pay for accomplishments, to assign a value to each year successfully completed, each credit earned and diploma or degree awarded,   This approach would certainly be much easier to administer.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>To go a step further, why not consider allowing students the option of challenging any and all courses for credit.  Drop all attendance requirements, establish criteria for each credit, levy an examination fee and award credit to successful candidates.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>To reduce administration, we could enclose a cheque along with the notification of a successful completion of each course.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Perhaps, on the other hand, a refund the examination fee would be sufficient reward.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
<p><br></p>
