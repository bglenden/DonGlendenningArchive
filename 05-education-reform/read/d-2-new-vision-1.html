  D-2 New vision-1  
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Glendenning observes that public education has lost its way through lack of vision, inward focus, inflexibility, and remoteness from communities. The system lacks clear focus, measurable goals, community engagement, and internal alignment. He attributes problems to organizational design rather than personnel, tracing issues to poor vision definition and failure to apply &quot;form follows function&quot; principles. He distinguishes between a &quot;Department of Education&quot; and the existing &quot;Department of Public Instruction.&quot; He cites declining importance of traditional credentials, referencing companies dropping degree requirements and &quot;Most Likely to Succeed&quot; film showing project-based learning&#x27;s effectiveness. He proposes project-based learning focused on basic skills, particularly mathematics, as a reform strategy aligned with emerging educational approaches.</div>

<p>Editor,</p>

<p>Dear Sir:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Education lacks a vision</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>Public education has lost its way.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It didn’t just happen this morning, or yesterday or even last year.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It has lost sight of its purposes, is inward looking, inflexible and remote.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The system needs a clearer focus, measurable goals, engagement with the people it serves, alignment of its various components, priorities and freedom to act with accountability for actions taken.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It must be frustrating to be a professional working within the system.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>It seems to me that the problems with our education system are primarily organizational; they are the result of a poorly defined vision, a failure to heed the <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>principle that, when organizing, “form follows function”, .<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As a result,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>we do not have a Department of Education but rather a Department of Public Instruction pushing a model that is expensive and also out of touch with the times. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The importance of diplomas and degrees is on the decline.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My morning paper mentioned two more companies that are dropping college degrees as an entry requirement, a few days ago my paper carried an item on “changing college admissions”, another on December 26 about high school diplomas “coming up short”, an article on school staffing patterns, and the fear that pervades the public school system.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span>On Sunday, January 17, some seventy Islanders gathered at City Cinema to view a film, </span><span>Most Likely to Succeed</span><span>, the film described one school’s attempt to improve education through project based learning.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span></span>A project-based approach involves having students design and construct devices, investigate questions, undertake research, discuss ideas and generally challenge cittent thinking; while not a panacea, project-based learning appears to produce positive results. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>As a lateral thinker, it seems to me that project based learning may also have potential as an approach to educational reform.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My nomination for a project would be “basic skills” and, within the cluster of basic skills, let’s start with mathematics.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Don Glendenning</p>
<p>A long-time student of education</p>
