  <li class="li7">philosopher Machiavelli, which dates to 1513, seems relevant to modern-day dynamics as they relate to implementing change.«There is nothing more difficult to carry out, nor more doubtful of success, nor more dangerous to handle, than to initiate a new order of things. For the reformer has enemies in all who profit by the old order, and only luke-warm defenders in all those who would profit by the new order. This luke-warmness arises partly from fear of their adversaries, who have the law in their favour; and partly from the incredulity of mankind, who do not truly believe anything new until they have had actual experience of it.»</li>
