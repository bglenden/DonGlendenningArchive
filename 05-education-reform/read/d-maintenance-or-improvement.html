  D Maintenance or improvement
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Don outlines a comprehensive reform platform emphasizing teacher focus on learning interactions, increased choice in schooling, and reduced school fixation. He argues teachers should accept learners as they find them (like medical doctors) rather than blame prior experiences. He advocates for staffing flexibility allowing specialists and paraprofessionals, greater student choice in pacing and course challenge opportunities, and developing community learning alternatives beyond schools. He notes PE has few unaligned education organizations serving learners. This piece synthesizes many of his recurring themes into a coherent reform agenda.</div>

<p>Dear Sir:</p>
<p><b>Better Schooling</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>Some thoughts on improving the public school system</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Focus on improving what happens<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>when a teacher and a learner interact; the objective is to improve the learning experience.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A teacher, like a medical doctor, must accept learners as they find them and help them learn.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Blaming the home, the previous school is unprofessional and not helpful.</p>
<p>I<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>believe that teachers want to teach and know how to teach.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That’s what they trained for, that’s what they are paid for.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The demands of running a school system, such as corridor patrol and fund raising, are not a good use of teacher time.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>For example, my dentist andz four paraprofessionals comprise his team.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Increased control of the teaching function and new staffing arrangements could go a long way to both improving instruction and reducing teacher burnout.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Increase choice, or some would say, increase competition.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>From what I read, increasing choice results in better education.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Once a school accommodates all local students who apply, it should accept others who apply.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I’m not sure that our rigid graduation requirements can be defended.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We allocate time available for students in each course when we know that some students learn more quickly than others.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Why not let them challenge for credit, and perhaps even chare a small fee for the privilege.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Nothing improves a system more quickly than the knowledge that the client can go elsewhere for service.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>We have a fixation on schooling.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We act as though the answer to all life’s problems is another course or more schooling.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We don’t have the same view of health.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In fact, we take measures to reduce the time spent in hospitals.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>We encourage people to take charge of their own health; why don’t we do the same for education.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It’s<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>what we can do with what we know that counts not how long it took us to learni.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>As I mentioned in an earlier letter, I am amazed at the number of unaligned health related organizations that serve people who are not well; I’m still searching for aan unaligned education on PEI.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We could use a few more in education and I would start with an organization is support of early childhood education, reading, writing, citizenship, and<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>career education to name but a few.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>By the way, as far as governance is concerned, the Department of Education should get out of the business of running schools and, to the greatest extent possible, delegate both responsibility and accountability to the lowest possible levels</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The cause is important, a review is timely, and there is considerable support for change. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It’s time to think outside the box.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Feel free to write me at<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>HYPERLINK "mailto:standards2020@gmail.com" <span>standards2020@gmail.com</span>.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
<p><br></p>
