<div class="reader-summary">A 2020 blog post criticizing PEI education structure (not people) as the barrier to improvement. Don references Education 2020 Inc.&#x27;s call for action and argues that the World Bank is correct—Islanders confuse schooling with education. He advocates shifting conversation from operational matters (buses, storm days, technology, grades) to learners, programs, and services. He questions what the Department of Education actually aims to accomplish and critiques unclear accountability structures.</div>

<p>	 Blog-D-1</p>
<p><b>In early 2015, the newly formed Education 2020 Inc.issued a “call for action” to improve public education; specific suggestions included a clear and compelling vidsion, a learner centered delivery model, development of a learning culture, delegation, professional accountability and the encouragement of innovation. While we still support<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>those changes, we are now of the view that the structure of education, and<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>not the people stands in the way of improvement.</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li1"><b>The World Bank tells us that Ministries of Education confuse going to school with getting an education; we think that is the case also on PEI.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We need to change the conversation to learners, programs, services and quality instead of buses, storm days, technology and grades.</b></li>
  <li class="li1"><b>We note, for instance, that professionals in health care play a much greater role and have a saignificantly different public profile that those in esucationWhile “’reading, riting <span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>and ‘rithmatic” ar still important studie4s the world of tomorrow calls for<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>soft skills, self management and interpersonal relationships et we do not see theselisted in any program syllabis.</b></li>

<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>I’It is unclear to me just what our Department of </b>Education is trying to do by way of education.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Educators are in the service business; they organize experiences that help others learn.help people learn; typical education services include:</p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li1"><b>Governance and leadership<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></li>
  <li class="li1"><b>Funding<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></li>
  <li class="li1"><b>Instruction<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></li>
  <li class="li1"><b>Human Resources<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></li>
  <li class="li1"><b>Products and technology<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></li>
  <li class="li1"><b>Information and counselling, and</b></li>
  <li class="li1"><b>Quality assurance</b></li>
</ul>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Education can happen s anywhere <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>- at home, at church, while travelling, at school. etc. Given the nature of education, numbers of people, and the range of needs and interests, communities usually provide purpose- built facilities called schools . I liken a modern school<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>to a shopping mall; I have friends who liken a school to a hospital – and it certainly is convenient to have resources under a single roof. The accountabilities, however, are quite different.. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>In the case of a mall, the store owner, delivers or directs the delivery of the product or service; in the case of a hospital, employees provide products and services largely under the direction of the doctor rather than the hospital administrator.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In the case of schools,the degree of supervision by principals is unclear.</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>And my expl</b></p>
<p><b>oration leaves the accountability of each quite unclear.</b></p>
