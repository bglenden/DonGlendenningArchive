  D 3 Report cards
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Don reflects on his old report cards and proposes that report cards should focus on future-oriented information exchange between school and family, similar to a follow-up doctor&#x27;s visit. Rather than merely reporting past achievements, report cards should identify what needs to happen next to help learners meet their objectives. He advocates for parents to access course outcomes from the Department of Education website and suggests students should receive copies of learning outcomes. The letter addresses parent concerns about jargon and proposes that criterion-referenced reporting, with proper explanation, can serve families better than simple grades. His example of doctor-patient communication reflects his inclination toward professional service models.</div>

<p><br></p>
<p>Dear Sir:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>What should a report card report?</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I came across some of my old report cards recently;<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>by the way, they weren’t as good as I remembered (or as I told my children).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They were the traditional report cards of the day with a numerical grade for each subject, record of absences and a mark for deportment.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They must have provided<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>the information my mother needed because she signed them<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>and I took them back to the teacher. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But what really triggered this letter was a report about changes proposed for reporting systems in BC.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I also recall some media coverage last year about report cards in Nova Scotia.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Reports should be viewed as a part of information exchange between two of the key players in the education process – that is, other than the learner, of course.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is like a return visit to your doctor’s office to report on progress, exchange information,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>and identify new strategies, if any. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The report cards I’ve seen tend to, as the name implies, report on what has happened.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>While that is important, the real value of the report and the ensuing discussion, is to focus on the future.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>What needs to be done next to ensure that the learner will meet his/her objectives?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>To move on to the next grade?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>To obtain an acceptable level of general education?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>To graduate?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>To meet college and university entrance requirements/<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>to meet job entry requirements?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Parents should be encouraged to view course outcomes available on the Department of education website; one article I read even suggested that parents, and eveh high school students, be given copies of actual outcomes for each course as an aid to learning.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>In the meantime, if you have trouble understanding your child’s report card, have a conversation with your principal; if you<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>are not clear on the mening of criterion referenced, I’m sure that your principal could help with that also.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>In the meantime, your reports are always welcome at<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>HYPERLINK "mailto:standards2020@gmail.com" <span>standards2020@gmail.com</span>.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p>I’d only withold informati and let the student decide whether or not to share it with parents.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Yhe basis of my secision would be the If parents are partners with teachers in the education process as we say they are, why not give them the information they want. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I’d distribute copies of outcomes to anyone who wants them especially to students; I think that kind of feedback would be helpful; in fact, although it is a bit massWill providing the extra information harm the student in any way?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In fact, there is one school of thought that believes that every child should be given a copy of outcomes for each course they are taking.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>One could even go a step further and report on each outcome.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I’ve heard some complaints about jaOn the issue of jargon, The issue here is one of helping each student obtain a quality education. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>It is a cause of concern among parents but changing could affect a students chances for rntrance into college or university.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>to a performance based<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Schools are caught in a dilemma.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Postsecondary hings have changed since then; parents want more detailed information.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A couple of<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>items in that regard caught my attention recently; one about report cards complained that they were full of jargon and told little about either achievements or short comings. The other was about parents who want a copy of their child’s actual exam so they could see the errors and provide tutoring. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
