<p><b>Definition:</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>Sometime it is useful to pause and define some of the words we<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>use almost daily; education is one of those words. Here is one such definition.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Powerful Questions</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>I was influenced by the work of Neil Postman especially by <span>“Teaching As A Subversive Activity”</span>; one of his suggestions, although I cannot seem to find it again, was that teachers place the following questions beside their mirrors to read every day:</p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li5">What will I do today that will make a difference to a student?</li>
  <li class="li5">What difference will it make?</li>
</ul>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li5">How do I know</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Regulating Teaching</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><span>The Beacon</span> of May 3, 2014 (Atlantic Institute for Market Studies - www.aims.ca) carried an article on March 14, 2014 calling for change in the Nova Scotia approach to teacher regulation.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I am sure that there are many issues to be resolved but the one that caught my attention is that of professional development.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Initial and continuing professional development will be key to ensuring a quality education for Islanders; it is unfortunate that it has become so contentious.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The key issues seem to be:</p>
<p><b>-<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Who is responsible </b>– employer or employee</p>
<p><b>- Content</b> – determined by teacher or principal</p>
<p><b>- Who pays</b> – employer, teacher, or shared<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><b>- When taken</b> – during or outside working hours</p>
<p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Our success in providing a quality education is at stake. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p><b>Access to Opportunity</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>I was challenged recently on the use of “gap” when referring to education.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I had defined a gap as “a conspicuous difference’ between<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>where we are and where we want to be.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>On further checking, however, I find that a gap could be a break in continuity, perceived as creating a problem in “access to opportunity”.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When people responded to the recent survey conducted by the Community Foundation survey (www.cfpei.ca) it was access to opportunity that they had in mind.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Is there a gap?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Students who are users of the system certainly think so.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>So do people who pay for it, taxpayer and parents and employers tell me so; the examples mentioned most often are mathematics, communications and life skills – usually defined as skills needed to function in well our every day activities.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Based on the above, I believe there is a gap.; it appears to be quite widespread and is not limited to PEI; and it needs to be better defined.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Is it a result of what we do or don’t do in schools?; partly.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There’s no doubt in my mind but that it is largely an education gap but some of the gap may be attributable to schools.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is too soon to tell But we really do not know that for sure until we better define it. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It may only be a communication issue.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>If it is a learning matter, it is likely that changes will be required to our education system.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Changes may be pedagogical, such as diagnosis and assessment, earlier intervention, teaching strategies, training of teachers, curriculum development, On the other hand, changes may be structural, scheduling, grouping, reporting, staffing patterns, entrance requirements by post secondary institutions, hiring criteria. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p>Mathematics has been under fire across the country.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>While math is not my specialty, there appear to be at least four issues:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Content – </b>In recent weeks I’ve been searching without success, for an analysis of math either as a field or of the subjects that comprise it; it doesn’t appear to exist. <span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>As a result, each province spends huge<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>amounts of money doing the same thing.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Methodology – </b>there are obviously strong views as to the best approach to teaching math.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Why must all teachers follow<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>the same method, a method that may not be the one that works best for them?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And let the parent decide on the school.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Assessment – </b>serves two purposes one is to determine next teaching steps and strategies; the other is to sort.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The two are in conflict.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I suggest that we hand the sorting process over to a separate agency.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></p>

<p>New East Prince facility prepares students for careers in the skilled trades<br>
<br>
Education and Early Childhood Development</p>
<p>High school students now have better opportunities to prepare for a career in the skilled trades with the opening of the new East Prince Career and Technical Education facility, says Premier Robert Ghiz.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“Our government understands the importance of investing in skills training and an educated workforce,” said Premier Ghiz. “Our $4.7 million investment in this new facility is meant to help Island youth take advantage of the many career opportunities ahead in the skilled trades. At the same time, it will address labour market shortages expected to occur in the trades as the workforce ages.”</p>
<p>Located next to the Three Oaks Senior High School, the new 25,000 square foot facility offers aerospace training, automotive and carpentry under one roof in a campus-like environment. It includes a new robotics lab, skilled-trades classrooms and alternative education spaces. It serves more than 500 students from Summerside, Kensington and Kinkora schools.</p>
<p>“Student achievement continues to be the number one priority for the Department of Education and Early Childhood Development,” said Minister Alan McIsaac. “We are committed to working with our educational partners to ensure all students can reach their full potential as they prepare to graduate to apprenticeship training, post secondary education or careers in the private sector. The provincially authorized curriculum for career and technical education provides sector-specific training that is preparing young Islanders for success in the workforce.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The Western School Board identified the new Career and Technical Education Centre as a priority in 2009 and it was included in the 2010-2011 capital budget. The cost of the project was $4,675,000. High school students from Three Oaks Senior High, Kensington Intermediate Senior High and Kinkora Regional High schools began attending courses at the new Career and Technical Education Centre in September 2012.</p>

<p>Parent involvement key to education success</p>
<p>By virginia mott,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>“</b>Research shows that making involvement in education more possible for parents — increasing parents’ access to information and including them in decision-making — is a cost-effective way to increase student achievement. The result of one research project shows “schools would have to spend $1,000 more per pupil to reap the same gains in student achievement that an involved parent brings.” That’s a significant amount of money.</p>
<p>It will take an investment of time to create the plan, review it annually and post it on schools’ and the Department of Education’s websites, but clearly there’s an excellent return on the investment.</p>
<p>Other research shows there is a positive measurable impact of engaged, informed parents on students’ academic achievement. As schools work to meet goals for annual yearly progress, as current law demands, isn’t it sensible to provide a mechanism to increase academic achievement through greater inclusion of parents?’</p>

<p><b>Farm Radio Forum</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>GUELPH, ONTARIO--(Marketwire - Aug. 3, 2009) - The Honourable Jim Prentice, Canada's Environment Minister and Minister responsible for Parks Canada, today celebrated the national historic significance of the National Farm Radio Forum which was designated as an event of national historic significance by Minister Prentice, on the recommendation of the Historic Sites and Monuments Board of Canada.<br>
<br>
"At its peak, the Forum had more than a thousand active groups, making this probably the largest adult education program in the world at the time. Its designation as an event of national historic significance underscores its contribution in building social and community life, education and social well-being," said Minister Prentice.<br>
<br>
"The National Farm Radio Forum brought people together from right across Canada through a shared interest in agriculture," said the Honourable Diane Finley, Minister of Human Resources and Skills Development. "I am honoured to highlight the historic importance of this successful model for rural development."<br>
<br>
An initiative of the adult education movement and the Canadian Federation of Agriculture, the National Farm Radio Forum was a program on the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation radio network. From 1941 to 1965, farmers across Canada gathered around radios to hear and discuss broadcasts on various topics ranging from technical farm subjects to social challenges of the agricultural community.<br>
<br>
Parks Canada works to ensure that Canada's historic and natural heritage is presented and protected for the enjoyment, education, appreciation and inspired discovery of all Canadians, today and in the future.</p>
