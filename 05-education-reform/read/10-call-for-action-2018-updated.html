Documents gaps between Islander needs and education services, citing PISA results, youth surveys, Chamber of Commerce presentations, and parent federation surveys. Proposes six major initiatives: comprehensive vision statement, independent qualification service, school autonomy, professional service delivery model, staff development, and provincial leadership in creating learning culture. Emphasizes student-centered outcomes, criterion-referenced assessment, and professional accountability to clients.</div>

	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Preparation
	for life’s roles is called education and the better prepared one
	is the better one will be able to cope with all that we encounter,
	or create.  Educating is a complex matter made so by the fact that
	each person is unique in many ways, unique in basic physical,
	mental, emotional make-up; unique in the range and nature of
	previous experience, unique in perceived futures, but also unique in
	terms of learning pace, style and needs.  Education is often
	described as any experience that has a formative effect on the way
	we think, feel or act; it may also be thought of as what we can do
	with what we have learned.</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">It
	is widely recognized that education is a key factor in determining
	each citizen’s quality of life; in the same way, the collective
	education of our citizens will determine to a significant degree the
	quality of the communities in which we live.  In recognition of its
	importance, governments provide massive support for public
	education. The investment is justified for two reasons, one to
	ensure a high level of personal growth and development for every
	citizen; the other is to ensure the common good. 
	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Based
	on media reports over the past few months, one can conclude that
	there is a gap between what Islanders have and what they want in the
	way of education. Literacy levels alone have come to the fore
	through <span lang="en-US">PISA
	results, recent CFPEI survey of Island youth, presentation to the
	Standing Committee by the Charlottetown Area Chamber of Commerce, 
	views expressed by the Summerside Chamber of Commerce, a 2014 survey
	by the PEI Home and School Federation and a series of workshops on
	Preparedness held throughout PEI by Education 20/20 Inc.  </span>
	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><a name="_GoBack"></a>
	Indicators
	of the gap include: the limited engagement between educators and the
	community they serve; the lack of a philosophy of education that
	encompasses all our citizens; government’s focus on the young and
	schooling; service gaps such as the availability of part time
	instruction; politicization of decision making, and limits on
	professional autonomy and accountability. Citizens see most of the
	issues as organizational, created by government decision-makers and,
	therefore, capable of being changed by those same government
	decision-makers.

	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">In
	recent years, Prince Edward Island has instituted a number of
	initiatives to improve education including new and upgraded
	facilities, additional investment in technology, the East Prince
	trade and technology centre, embedded professional development (PD)
	days, but much more needs to be done.  It is our view that the
	impact of these changes has been blunted by an outdated delivery
	organization and, in support of this view, we recommend that PEI:</p>

		</p></li>
	</ol>
	<p style="orphans: 2; margin-bottom: 0in; widows: 2; margin-left: 0.75in; line-height: 100%">
	Although
	much has been written about education, a comprehensive vision
	statement does not currently exist for PEI. We believe that having
	such a statement is required, especially for a service as large and
	complex as education, however, we are not suggesting another study
	but rather a document prepared by a small working with opportunity
	for citizen input.</p>

	The
	role of teachers is to help others learn; when teachers rank their
	students they are putting their ability to teach at risk. Assigning
	student grades, selecting students for prizes and awards and
	awarding diplomas and degrees is a sorting process and should not be
	part of a teacher’s role.  Apprenticeship with certification
	through a Provincial Department of Labour and music through the
	Royal Canadian Music Conservatory are examples of the recommended
	arrangement. PEI, perhaps Canada, needs an independent h a
	qualification body for the purpose certifying individual levels of
	achievement to persons wanting or needing such documentation</p>
