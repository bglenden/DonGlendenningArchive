  D 2014 Problem solving
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Don applies systems thinking to education reform, arguing that the public school system lacks normal problem-solving mechanisms. He identifies math skill gaps as an example where students, employers, and post-secondary institutions all report problems but no systematic resolution occurs. He contrasts the current system with other professions (law, medicine, counseling) that employ specialists for problem-solving. Don calls for establishing formal mechanisms to identify, define, and resolve educational problems, noting that historically the system resolved issues by allowing struggling students to drop out—an unacceptable modern alternative.</div>

<p>Dear Sir:</p>
<p><b>Problem solving in education<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></b></p>
<p>Life is a constant problem-solving adventure; each of us has developed our own response mechanisms depending on the nature of the problem.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Our normal problem solving mechanism, however, don’t appear to work when problems occur with school.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Problems arise when something interferes with our ability to reach a goal.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As an example, after graduating from high school, young people hope/expect to either enrol in further studies<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>or find work.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The goal is blocked for some people, however, because of their level of math skills.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That presents a problem for the person, for employers and for our government.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>So, I would argue, we have a problem, likely a number of problems, depending on yur perspective, with ma</p>
<p>that the level of math <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>that their math levels are insufficient to gain entrance to further education or to work; at the same time, post secondary institutions and employers report that young people lack similar skills.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>One commonmany people make a good living helping people solve their problems whether the problems be personal, financillm interpersonal, work disputes columnists The first step in solving a problem is to define it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If column inches of coveraSo what’s the problem?</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Appears to lack the normal problem solving mechanisms</p>
<p>Who has the problem</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Dissatisfied client/customer</p>

<p>The public school system needs a problem solving mechanism; historically, school problems were solved by students dropping out.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In my own schooling, for example, over 30 students entered grade 7; in Grade 11, the final grade at that time, there were 12. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
