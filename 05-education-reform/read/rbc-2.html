<div class="reader-summary">Dated November 5, 2015, Don updates Mary McInnis, Manager of RBC Charlottetown, on Education 20/20&#x27;s progress and solicits continued financial support. He notes that calls for education system change have become &quot;more frequent, more widespread, and more urgent.&quot; While Education 20/20 doesn&#x27;t claim credit for driving change, Don observes they are helping keep education in the public spotlight. He outlines recent activities: monthly bilingual newsletters, public presentations, workshops, website, media coverage, Excellence in Education Awards ($2,500 annually to innovative schools), meetings with MLAs and education officials, and the &quot;Call for Action&quot; document with seven recommendations. Don details future plans: a working group exploring gaps between K-12 education and postsecondary/employment readiness, and improved student achievement measurement. He requests ongoing financial support, suggesting $1,000 annually for three years, with contributions directed through the Community Foundation of PEI.</div>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"> Dear
Ms. McInnis:</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">It
is a while since we were last in touch about public education in PEI
and, although you are on the mailing  list for our Newsletter and
announcements, I’d like to take a moment to bring you up to date on
our activities – and invite your support.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">There
is no question that, in recent months calls for change in the
education system  have become more frequent, more widespread, and
more urgent in their tone; while we do not take credit for the
changes, at a minimum, our activities are helping to keep the issue
before the public.  We have yet to see changes that we proposed but
hope springs eternal  for real change in education, even though
history tells us that proposed changes are likely to fall far short
of what is required and, even more so, are likely not to deal with
root causes of the education malaise.  
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Activities
of Education 20/20 during the past few months include: 
</p>
<ul>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">A
	monthly bilingual newsletter, public presentations and workshops, a
	website and some exposure in both print and social media</p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">An
	<u>Excellence in
	Education Award</u> in
	the amount of $2,500 to a PEI school or early learning centre; the
	Award was won in 2014 by the Kinkora Regional High School and in
	2015 by Prince Street Elementary School; the 2016 award has just
	been announced.</p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Meetings
	and conversations with Members of the Legislative Assembly,
	education officials both in Government and the English Language
	School Board, and other opinion makers</p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><u>A
	Call for Action</u>
	that identified seven steps to improving public education in PEI.

</ul>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">In
addition to the above, our plans for the coming year include: 
</p>
<ul>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">A
	working group recently established to explore the gaps that our
	young people encounter when seeking entrance to postsecondary
	institutions or employment.  
	</p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">A
	better system for measuring student achievement, especially as it
	relates to basic skill levels.</p></li>

We cannot do this alone; we
need your help.  This letter seeks your financial support for the
work we do.  Our costs have been minimal but real; our donor base is
small but committed.  $1,000 per year for the next three years would
certainly give us stability in our ongoing activities; we also
seeking project funds.    We are pleased to be able to say that the
Community Foundation of Prince Edward Island supports this
educational initiative and administer our funds.  Contributions<b>
</b>should be directed
to the Foundation (Community Foundation of Prince Edward Island, 119
Queen Street, Charlottetown, PE  C1A 4B3) who will issue charitable
receipts.</p>
