  D Box Stores of Education
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Don uses a retail metaphor to critique schools as &quot;box stores of education&quot; that, while efficient at accommodating large numbers of learners, lack ability to cater to individual needs. He notes that box schools employ missionary-like zeal to capture all learners and provide babysitting services. While acknowledging their role, he advocates for educational diversity including specialized schools (basic skills, sciences, arts) and alternative settings (home learning, workplace). He notes Nova Scotia&#x27;s Junior Achievement credit system and advocates for similar credit for experiential learning. The metaphor demonstrates his ability to make complex arguments accessible and his belief that educational diversity and local control serve learners better than monopolistic systems.</div>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Imagine
a community with only box stores in the retail field.  Gone are the
shoe stores, dress shops, pizza parlours, corner groceries, country
stores, fast food outlets and muffler shops.  Having only box stores
may be efficient but I would miss the specialty stores and personal
service – and having all box stores would make for a much less
interesting community.  
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Schools
have become the box stores of education; people who work there have a
missionary-like zeal to capture all learners.  Box schools certainly
can accommodate large number of learners for long periods of time but
have a limited ability to cater to individual needs.  The fact that
box schools also provide babysitting is also an attractive option.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Box
schools certainly have their place in education but also have their
limitations.  I’d like to see a greater variety of options.  Why
not schools specializing in basic skills, the sciences and the arts. 
Even encourage people to learn at home or in the workplace; while in
Halifax recently, I learned that the Nova Scotia system now gives
school credit for successful experience in Junior Achievement. 
Instead of trying to duplicate JA in schools why not give a school
crdit for JA experience.  .  Given the new technologies, options to
box schools become increasingly feasible and attractive.
