  D Criteria  
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Don articulates evaluative criteria for assessing educational system changes, grounded in two foundational purposes: (1) help young people develop skills for their futures, and (2) ensure community has skills needed to create desirable community life. He proposes three judgment criteria: (a) Will change increase opportunities for children developing skills needed for their futures? (b) Will change improve the community? (c) Considering everything, is this the best fund allocation? He laments that all three Maritime provinces&#x27; education department websites lack clear purpose statements (reviewed pre-writing), containing &quot;wordy&quot; language scoring high on &quot;fog index.&quot; He identifies four common purposes (postsecondary prep, employment prep, develop fullest potential, citizenship) plus a fifth: &quot;provide people with skills needed to maintain the community we call home.&quot; He calls on citizens to tell government what schools are for, rather than waiting for government declarations.</div>

<p>Editor,</p>
<p>Charlottetown Guardian</p>
<p>Charlottetown, PEI	</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Dear Sir:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><b>Judging the impact of system changes</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>Sometimes I am asked and sometimes I volunteer my views about changes being proposed or made to a school system.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I start from the belief that a school system has two purposes (a) to help young people develop the skills needed to function as citizens and (2) to ensure that the community has the skills needed to make it a place we want to live.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Based on the above, I judge the impact of changes on the following criteria:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>How will the change increase the opportunity and likelihood of children developing the skills needed for their futures?</p>
<p>How will the change improve the community in which I live?</p>
<p>All things considered, is this the best way to allocate funds, and why?</p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>All Provinces struggle with the gap between what the community wants and what the system delivers in the way of education.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The decisions can’t be easy but it would be interesting to know the criteria taken into account.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Don Glendenning</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Don Glendenning</p>
<p>A retired educator</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Part of the problem lies in the absence of clear and measurable purposes and goals in Departments of Education literature.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In fact, I checked government websites in all three Maritime Provinces before beginning to write and lots of words but no clear one-line.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Educational writing is wordy and, to quote one of my instructors at the New Brunswick Technical Institute, tends to rate very high<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>level on any “fog index”. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>My search for school purposes produced four:</p>
<p>•	Prepare for postsecondary education</p>
<p>•	Prepare for employment</p>
<p>•	Help people develop their fullest potential</p>
<p>•	Prepare for citizenship</p>
<p>… and then there was one with a different twist “To provide people with the skills needed to maintain the community we call home. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Let’s not wait for out governments tell us what our schools are for. Let’s tell rhem instead</p>
