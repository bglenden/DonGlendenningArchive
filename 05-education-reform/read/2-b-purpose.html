  2-B Purpose
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">This is a revised version of File 15, with identical central argument but additional development. Don proposes a specific purpose statement: &quot;the purpose of the public education system is to help Islanders develop skills, knowledge, and attributes needed for citizenship.&quot; He cites New Brunswick&#x27;s benchmark that &quot;every child will leave Grade 5 having mastered the tools to learn – reading, writing and numeracy.&quot; The revised version emphasizes that clear purpose provides focus for instruction, assessment, and reporting, moving beyond traditional grading to report what has been learned and proficiency level.</div>

<p>Dear Editor:</p>
<p>Our education purpose</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>It is not clear just what we are trying to accomplish through public education in PEI. Department literature speaks of “creating opportunities for student success”, ‘helping students secure a place in society” and the role of the Department as one of “developing and delivering high quality programs and curriculum” and there may be others.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>None of the above, however, seem to capture the role and spirit of what education is doing or needs to be done.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Neither do they provide sufficient detail on which to design programs or measure results.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Education is a service to people; people fill a number of roles including that of a citizen, family member, individual, student, consumer and producer. All roles deserve support. Based on my conversations with Islanders, however, citizen and employment “destinations” are suggested most often as preferred contexts. This could be translated in a statement like “the purpose of the public education system is to help Islanders develop skills, knowledge, and other attributes needed for citizenship”. A recent New Brunswick statement proposes that “every child will leave Grade 5 having mastered the tools to learn – reading, writing and numeracy”.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A statement of this sort wouldcertainly<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>sharpen the focus for PEI.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>A clear purpose not only directs an organization. it provides a focus for instruction and assessment; Instead of simply teaching a subject or a grade level, teachers would be helping students gain skills needed to function or thrive in the years ahead. Report cards would report what has been learned and how well.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Covid years were difficult for education; a “post Covid” public conversation on future direction is called for.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
<p><br></p>
