  D 2014 What does the taxpayer pay for 
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Don critiques education&#x27;s focus on instructional time rather than learning outcomes, contrasting schools with other professions where service quality matters more than process duration. He notes schools predetermine time availability regardless of individual learning pace, creating boredom for fast learners and discouragement for slower ones. He advocates for flexible timelines allowing students to progress at individual rates—completing material early when ready or receiving additional time as needed—arguing that administrative convenience has replaced learning-centered scheduling.</div>

<p>Dear Sir:</p>
<p><b>Time to switch the focus.</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>When you hire a lawyer, you pay him or her to represent you; when you see a doctor, you pay for treatment that, hopefully, will bring you back to good health.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is true that your bill reflects the length of time and the seriousness of the case but focus is on the service not the time.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is true that hospital stays have more of a focus on time but even there, the conversation is on the client and how long he or she will be off work, will require rehab services or be on medication.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Time varies from client to client but the focus is always on the client.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Not so in education.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We seldom if ever read about how long it takes for a person to learn to program, to reach the next level of math, to learn a second language, nor do students reach reach the next level early.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If there is mention of time, it is usually about teacher availability rather than learning.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In fact, time available is determined before the student and teacher ever meet and rarely reflects a student’s actual need.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The option of reaching a new level in less time or being allowed extra time<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>is not available.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As a result some students are bored and other students get discouraged.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We’ve chosen a scheduling model<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>that is administratively easy over one that favours learning. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Reinstating exemptions and allowing students to for credit without having to take a course are small steps in the right direction, but I am sure that there areother ways as well</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
