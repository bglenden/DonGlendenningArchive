<div class="reader-summary">A December 16, 2012 letter updating Robert O&#x27;Hanley on Education 20/20 Inc.&#x27;s progress and mission. Don expresses the critical importance of education and articulates his belief in the necessity of fundamental systemic change, including greater school autonomy, reduced bureaucracy, teacher freedom/accountability, preschool attention, expanded choice, and reformed standards. He reports a dozen community meetings held, establishment of a cadre of reform-minded individuals, and federal incorporation achieved. Recent activities include early childhood education workshops, school engagement software testing, innovation awards, educator dialogues (particularly on reading skills), and exploration of public information gaps. Seeking additional funds for implementation, Don solicits ScotiaMcLeod&#x27;s continued support and early decision-making.</div>

<p>Dear Mr. O’Hanley:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>This is a follow-up to my letter of May 31, 2012 about the need for change in our school system, and our efforts to bring about changes.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I cannot overstate the importance of education both for individuals and for the future of our community and country.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Doing more of the same is not an answer; we need a fundamental change in thinking about what constitutes an education and the role of schools.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We know at least some of the steps that must be taken, more autonomy for schools, less bureaucracy, greater freedom and accountability for teachers, more attention to the preschool years, greater choice among providers and changes in standards and reporting. <span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Since we last spoke, we have convened a dozen small group meetings on a variety of educational topics with educators and the public to explore mutual concerns and interests. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As a result, we now have a cadre of people who share our philosophy, who understand the need for change and are willing to help make change happen.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We are now federally incorporated as <span>Education 20/20 Inc</span>., are working on a logo and website, and are now seeking charitable status with Revenue Canada.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In addition, we have initiated the following activities:</p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li6">A workshop on Early Childhood Education during which a panel of front line practitioners, shared their experiences and approaches in the education of children; participants included other early childhood workers, parents, educators and members of the community at large.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We plan to offer workshops in other Island communities in the months ahead.</li>
  <li class="li6">A test of a new software package, developed in Canada, to assess the range and nature of school- community engagement...<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This test is being undertaken because engagement improves student performance. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li6">An award to an Island school that best exemplifies a high level of engagement in its every day school activities; criteria, policies and procedures are now under development.</li>
  <li class="li6">A dialogue with educators, especially decision makers, about educational issues, with the reading skills of high school graduates being at the top of our list.</li>
  <li class="li6">An exploration as to how best to handle the public information gap.</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>More needs to be done and we need your help; to implement these plans requires financial support beyond our current resources.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I would welcome the opportunity to provide additional information about the changes required in our education system or the plans of Education 20/20 Inc.; an early decision would support our ability to confirm our plans for the coming year.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>With best wishes for the holiday season.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Don Glendenning, CM</p>
<p>President</p>
