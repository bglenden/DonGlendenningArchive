  Sorting My Rank is My Business
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">A near-duplicate of &quot;Sorting (2).doc&quot; reiterating Don&#x27;s fundamental opposition to student ranking in educational institutions. Don asserts class standing is personal business and schools should not publicize rankings. He argues educational enrollment differs from competition and should not be conducted as a race. Don identifies problems: achievement variance results primarily from differential time availability; schools limit achievement by constraining time; systems allow only one top student annually, penalizing students not schools. Don supports external educational competitions and recognition but opposes internal school ranking. He questions university admissions using rank despite minimal differences between ranked students and arguments that success depends on qualities beyond class standing. Don emphasizes schools should focus on education, not sorting, and universities should establish independent entrance criteria rather than relying on school rankings.</div>

<p><b>My Rank is My Business</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Whether I stand first or last in my class is my business and only my business.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In fact, in my view, educational institutions have no business ranking students.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If I enter a competition, I can expect to be ranked, and have my rank made public.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But enrolling in an educational institution is not a race – or it shouldn’t be.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Institutions that rank students and publicize the results are doing their students a disservice.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I take this position for several reasons.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>It is, or should be, possible for almost everyone to reach the same level of achievement in a subject or group of subjects such as those required for graduation.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The difference is a resut of time available to students than anything else.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Unfortunately, schools place limits on the achievement of many students by making time the constant and achievement the variable.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Instead of designing a system that allows all students to reach the top level, Schools impose time limits that force some students to quit before they reach the level of which they are capable.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Our current arrangement is to allow only one student to reach the top of the mountain each year.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And is the student, not the school that gets penalized.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Now I am not against student competitions and the recognition of high standing gained therein.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And for giving prizes and publicity to winners.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In fact, I think that there should be more competitions and rewards for educational accomplishments.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My view, however, is that such competitions should be outside not inside the school system.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>It has always been my view that colleges and universities should not cream the crop.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They should neither accept nor reject a person because they stood first in their class.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The difference between a person standing first and second may be minute and, in fact, likely insignificant.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Making decisions on rank alone disregards the many other qualities that lead to success in further study and in later life.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Again, I am not suggesting that colleges and universities not consider high marks but that rank in class not be one of the criteria.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>In addition to the above, it is my view that schools should be in the education business not the sorting business.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The publication of all grade information is sorting but publication of rankin is sorting in its most odious form.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Colleges and universities are and should be free to set the criteria for entrance and to institute their own selection procedures.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Taking this position, I would argue, would allow schools to concentrate on providing a good education and not limit the educational experience to those subjects required for university or college entrance.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Obtaining an education should not be limited to the few courses now required for high school graduation.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Many secondary schools in our neighbour to the south no longer rank highs school students and some who do, refuse to release their rankings to universities and colleges.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I am told that upwards of 50 percent of all high schools have taken this stand.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>My own experience with ranking is limited and ancient.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The one example that comes to mind, however, is a grade 8 or nine graduation during which the rank of every student was given.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The event made a lasting impression.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I’ve often wondered about the impact of that event on the students’ future.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I’m of the view that high schools. Colleges and universities should discontinue the practice of ranking students.</p>
