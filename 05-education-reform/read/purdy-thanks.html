  Purdy thanks
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Dated July 6, 2013, this warm, personal letter thanks Henry Purdy for his contribution to Education 20/20&#x27;s letterhead design. Don recounts a humorous parking lot anecdote about visiting the Royal Bank, seeing Purdy vacating a parking space, and playfully commenting on Purdy&#x27;s banking deposits versus his own withdrawals. The letter expresses deep gratitude for &quot;your friendship and support for yea these many years&quot; and wishes Purdy a great summer. The informal, affectionate tone reveals Don&#x27;s capacity for personal warmth and his ability to build long-standing friendships outside formal professional structures. The letter provides a glimpse of Don&#x27;s social life and his appreciation for those who supported his various endeavors over the years.</div>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">Dear Henry:</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">Just a note to show you our
letterhead and to thank you for your contribution; I really liked the
extra life in the original design but settled for a single colour.  
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in"><a name="_GoBack"></a>I was looking
for a parking space yesterday to visit the Royal Bank; thought that I
would have a chance to say hello to you and Gertie inside.  Went
completely around an extended  block and returned just as you and
Gertie were leaving; thanks for vacating a spot – and one with
surplus time on the meter.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">Your visit to the bank was also
comforting because I knew that you would be making deposits; I, on
the other hand, had to withdraw funds and was worried that the bank
might be running low.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">This, Henry, is all by the way of
again thanking you for your friendship and support for yea these many
years.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">Have a great summer.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">Warmest regards</p>
