  2020 Math
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Letter from Don describing his investigation of PEI mathematics instruction, undertaken not as a math specialist but from recognizing math as a frequently-cited community concern. Don details his research: interviews with math educators, curriculum examination, survey administration, and internet research. Key findings include citizens need math fluency not extensive knowledge, tutoring helps struggling students, good teaching overcomes home disadvantages, more practice time needed, teacher preparation requires strengthening, competencies better than outcomes for curriculum development, and emerging rating scales reflect real-life criteria with self-assessment components.</div>

<p>Dear Editor:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Some time ago, I decided to explore math instruction on PEI; I did so, not because I am a math major, but because math is the subject mentioned most often in conversations as a topic of concern.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Furthermore, I thought it might be interesting to explore one subject area rather than having rambling conversations across the whole field.</p>
<p>I talked with people who know more about math than I do, examined Grade 9. 10, 11 and 12 math curriculum outlines, browsed a math text, tried to obtain a curriculum development handbook, skimmed most if not all Provincial Education websites a number of times,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>convinced a dozen people to complete math survey and, of course scanned <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>the internet a number of times using a variety of search words and phrases..<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As a result, my little “office” is awash in loose papers.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My findings:</p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li1">Citizens don’t need a lot of math but they need to be fluent in math facts.</li>
  <li class="li1">Tutoring during and after school classes seems to help students who are having difficulty with math</li>
  <li class="li1">Good teaching can offset the effect of “poor homes”</li>
  <li class="li1">Students need more time to practice math applications;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li1">Teachers may need more application/practice as part of their preparation</li>
  <li class="li1">Competencies reflect community applications than outcomes and, therefore,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>make a<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>better foundation for curriculum development</li>
  <li class="li1">Emerging rating scales tend to reflect criteria used in real life and include self- rating as part of the process.</li>
</ul>
<p>I continue to explore the issue.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></p>
<p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Sincerely</p>
