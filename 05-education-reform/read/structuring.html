<div class="reader-summary">Letter titled &quot;Restructuring Needed&quot; outlining five structural issues: purpose (need to define life roles better), services (information, counselling, instruction, products, technology, quality assurance, governance, funding, HR), structure (organize by function not clients), autonomy (teacher freedom to respond to learner needs), and accountability (autonomy with accountability jointly applied). Emphasizes these are not new issues but require public dialogue and action.</div>

<div class="reader-content">
<p>Dear Editor:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Restructuring needed</p>
<p>The education literature speaks of the need for educational reform. I agree; the mos pressing issues, I suggest, are structural.</p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li1">Purpose sets the stage for what we do and how we organize to do it. The PEI education literature refers to helping people find a place in society; we need to better define that “place”.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Life might work; they have been described as that of a individual, citizen, a producer, a consumer, family member and student. All roles can benefit from education<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>but all may not need the same mix at the same time.</li>
  <li class="li1">Services - Typical education services include: information, counselling, instruction, products and technology, quality assurance. governance, funding and human resources;<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Learners may need any or all services at any point in their education journey. Well defined services are key to serving independent learners.</li>
  <li class="li1">Structure -” Form follows function” is still the standard when structuring any venture; one would expect, therefore, that the basic education structure would reflect services offered.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Instead, the Department appears to be structured around clients served.</li>
  <li class="li1">Autonomy – as mentioned earlier, education is a service.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Front line service providers (teachers) need both expertise and autonomy to respond to learner needs. The OECD tells us that PISA results are better for students in schools with autonomy for their day-to-day operation; the World Bank advises Ministries of Education to delegate. PEI should follow suit.</li>
  <li class="li1">Accountability -. Mathew Bedard of the Montreal Economic Institute points out that “autonomy and accountability jointly applied” would cost practically nothing and allow education to better adapt to the diversity of student needs and aptitudes. Yet teachers and principals in PEI appear to have little freedom to adjust services to suit individual learner needs.</li>
</ul>
<p>These structural issues are not new; no doubt readers have others to propose. All should be considered. They need to be dealt with soon, and should be dealt with in a public manner.</p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
<p>Don Glendenning</p>
