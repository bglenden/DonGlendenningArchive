  D_A Educ system
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Don argues that PEI has a &quot;school system&quot; rather than an &quot;education system,&quot; focused only on young people. Drawing analogies to health systems (where hospitals are part of broader services) and legal systems, he contends that education services should extend beyond schools to serve the total community. A true education system would expand the Department&#x27;s role, improve standards, increase community involvement, and better utilize technology.</div>

<p><b>Dear Editor:</b></p>
<p><b>Recently, I had a brief conversation with a friend about our need for an education system in PEI; he agreed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It seems that we have a school system rather than an education system and one focused on focused on young people. We agreed that we need an education system focused on the needs of the total community.</b></p>
<p><b>The need for change arises from the changing<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>community needs, more flexible responses from service providers, support for independent learners, micro credentials,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b>Such changes shouldn’t be surprising. We have a health system of which hospitals are a part, we have a legal system that includes law courts, and religion flourishes outside churches. In the same way, education services should not be limited to learners in schools.</b></p>
<p><b>A system of education would likely expand he role of the Department, bring more relevant standards, increase community involvement and greater use of technology. First, however, will be clear purpose(s).</b></p>
<p><b>Sincerely</b></p>
