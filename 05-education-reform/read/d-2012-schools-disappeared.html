  D 2012 Schools Disappeared
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Published September 5, 2012, this letter references Don&#x27;s memory of Patrick Watson&#x27;s 1969 keynote at the PEI Teachers&#x27; Federation convention titled &quot;The Day the Schools Disappeared,&quot; which explored hypothetical scenarios if communities lost school infrastructure. Don poses a more provocative question: what would change if schools lost connection to the School Board and departmental oversight? He asks whether the loss of bureaucratic layers would affect student numbers, instruction quality, achievement, operations, or costs. The letter reveals his conviction that institutional structures often hinder rather than help educational effectiveness.</div>

<p>Dear Sir:</p>
<p><b>The Day the Schools Disappeared</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The year was 1969; I had just arrived on PEI.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The PEI Teachers’ Federation was holding its annual convention.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The Confederation Centre was packed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I arrived late and actually sat on the top step while listening to Patrick Watson.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“The Day the Schools Disappeared” was a presentation I will never forget. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>For 40 minutes or more, Watson led us through some likely scenarios should a community find itself without schools. What would happen to the children? Where would classes be held? What subjects were most important?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>What should they do first?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>What kind of schools, if any, are needed? Could classes be held in the library?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And so on.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We need that kind of discussion today, but let me pose a different question</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>If,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>tomorrow morning, schools should lose all contact with School Board and Department staff, what difference would it make to a local school and community?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And even more catastrophic would be the loss of all Departmental regulations, policies, guidelines,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>etc.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>What would be the impact on: <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Number of students?</p>
<p>Quality of instruction?</p>
<p>Student achievement levels?</p>
<p>Standards?</p>
<p>Daily operation?</p>
<p>Educational focus?</p>
<p>Cost?</p>
<p>Engagement?</p>
<p>Teacher workload?</p>
<p>Administration?</p>
<p>Teacher health and morale?</p>
<p>I raise this issue because of the view that the pressing issues in education result from an out moded delivery system rather thhan out of date pedagogy, but I would be delighted to hear your views at<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><span> HYPERLINK "mailto:standards2020@gmail.com" </span><span>standards2020@gmail.com.</span></p>
