  D Cost of fixing Education  
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Don catalogs the comprehensive government control of education: provincial governments appoint trustees, build schools, develop curriculum, set standards, hire teachers, measure achievement, limit competition, provide instruction, and issue credentials and grades. He argues this level of control far exceeds government involvement in any other sector, and consequently government has lost regulatory capacity. Because government operates schools, criticism of results becomes political criticism of government itself, making all educational change political. He argues the system has lost checks and balances that ensure quality. Don proposes government must delegate meaningful decision-making authority to school boards, schools, and teachers. This systematic analysis of how government monopoly creates political dysfunction represents his most comprehensive structural critique.</div>

<p>Editor,</p>
<p>Charlottetown Guardian</p>
<p>Charlottetown, PEI	</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Dear Sir:</p>
<p><b>Depoliticize education</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>Since provincial governments run schools in Canada, government alone must take responsibility for school results.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Government holds all the cards, appoints trustees,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>builds schools, develops curriculum, sets standards, hires teachers, measures student achievement, limits competition, provides instruction, and issues credentials and grades; in spite of protestations to the contrary, trustees, principals and teachers have little control over the things that count; practically all important decision about a student are made by a government employee under regulations and conditions that government establishes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The degree to which government controls education far exceeds government control in any other sector.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>As a result, government has lost its ability to regulate the sector; criticism of what is happening is a criticism of government itself and, because governing is a political act, all changes to education become political.<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>A myriad of regulations, formulae and “Ministerial directives” limit the ability of teachers to help students learn the attitude, skills and knowledge needed to become the citizens we want.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The system has lost the normal checks and balances that bring about a quality product or service.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>It doesn’t have to be this way but until government delegates meaningful decision making authority to school boards, schools and teachers, we can expect little improvement.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Don Glendenning</p>
<p>A long-time student of education</p>
