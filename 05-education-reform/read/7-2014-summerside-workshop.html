  7-2014-Summerside workshop
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">March 12, 2014 workshop report from Summerside addressing education and community needs. &quot;Culture&quot; emerged as a central theme, encompassing economic skills, literacy, numeracy, personal finance, and social caring. Attendees identified a disconnect between schools and communities, including low engagement, poor event attendance, voting participation gaps, and limited communication. Workshop opened with Community Foundation survey findings on Island youth concerns (health, education, employment, well-being) presented by Steve McQuaid and Katherine MacDonald. Don Glendenning chaired the session and advocated for CBC Compass to create a regular education slot. Workshop was part of Education 20/20&#x27;s ongoing community dialogue initiative.</div>

<p><b>Education and community needs</b></p>
<p>The word ”culture” arose often in a workshop on Tuesday evening in Summerside; while not actually defined, it included the skills and attitudes needed to maintain a local economy, skills for living such as literacy, numeracy and personal finance, and the social skills needed to support a culture of care.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A second theme was that of the disconnect between communities and their schools, the lack of engagement, low attendance at school events, problem of voter turnout and limited communication.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And this is happening, it was pointed out, although it is recognized that students perform better when parents are engaged.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>One specific suggestion was that CBC Compass create a regular slot for items about education.</p>
<p>The workshop opened with a presentation on the findings of a recent survey of over 200 Island youth between the ages of 15 and 25.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The survey, Taking the Pulse of Island Youth, dealt with youth concerns about health, education, employment and social well-being.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The presenters, led by Steve McQuaid, VP of the Community Foundation of Prince Edward Island and Katherine MacDonald, Researcher, provided details about the methodology and results. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The workshop, chaired by Don Glendenning, was organized by Education 20/20, an independent group devoted to improving the quality of education for every citizen.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The next workshop is planned for Wellington on April 25.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Readers who are interested will find further information on the website, www.education2020.ca including an address for receiving the monthly newsletter.</p>
