	is considered essential in every day life and, for the most part, is
	organized around the conventional structure of Arithmetic, Algebra,
	Geometry, Trigonometry, Calculus, Probability and Statistics.  One
	of the main goals for students of PEI Grade 9 mathematics is to
	“become mathematically literate
	adults”. The PEI math program is based on some 382 <u>Specific
	</u>Curriculum Outcomes (SCO).
	Outcomes are developed by the Northwest Education Protocol operating
	in Western Canada and coordinated by the Alberta Department of
	Education; their analyses and curriculum materials are used by a
	number of Provinces including the four in Atlantic Canada. Citizens
	in all walks of life participated in the identification process,

	rather than a survey of skills actually used in every day life</p>

	is also mathematics, the application of math, and is receiving

	“having the confidence and skill to use numbers and mathematical
	approaches in all aspects of life.” The National Centre for the
	Study of Adult Learning and Literacy did a major study and of
	numeracy skills and identified four major context components –
	Family and Personal, Workplace. Community and Further Learning. A
	Report by the PEI Department of Education on the Early Numeracy
	Intervention Program (ENIP) found that numeracy “gives students
	the tools and the skills to solve problems logically, and to
	developmental flexibility, thought, self-efficacy, and the ability
	to persevere” According to the Conference Board of Canada,
	“Overall, Canada earns a “C” grade on inadequate numeracy
	skills.&quot; With regard to instruction, educators are faced with a
