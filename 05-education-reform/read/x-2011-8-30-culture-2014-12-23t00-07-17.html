<div class="reader-summary">Letter examining how school culture fails to model real-world expectations for work and life. Glendenning critiques schools for operating on rigid time schedules, lacking service mentality, mimicking outdated industrial organizations, and obscuring accountability. He advocates for cultural changes that emphasize self-direction, collegial operations, and transparent accountability rather than merely adding new courses.</div>

<p>Dear Sir:</p>
<p>The Culture of schools</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Schools help young people prepare to function in a variety of life roles, that of an</p>
<p>individual, a family member, a learner, producer, consumer and citizen. To the</p>
<p>extent possible, therefore, schools should not only teach relevant subjects but also</p>
<p>model the society into which students are being graduated.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li1">At work, one finishes a task and then moves to another; in school students move to another task after a set time whether or not the first task is finished,</li>
  <li class="li1">Students begin work when the teacher enters the room and finish when the teacher leaves the room society needs people who are self-directed</li>
  <li class="li1">Schools lack a service mentality; they have a guaranteed clientele regardless of the quantity and quality of their work,</li>
  <li class="li1">Schools operate as old-time industrial organizations even though the work structure has become collegial.</li>
  <li class="li1">The system obscures accountability of both students and teachers</li>
  <li class="li1">Teacher pay is based on education and experience; it should be based on job size and performance.</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p>I'm glad to say that one hears, but not very often, of exceptions to the above practices, but I'd like to see those exceptions become the rule.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>These are cultural issues they cannot be resolved by simply adding new courses.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Instead, we need to change the way schools operate. Not only will these changes make life more satisfying for teachers and students, but it will better reflect the community into which our students.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
<p><br></p>
