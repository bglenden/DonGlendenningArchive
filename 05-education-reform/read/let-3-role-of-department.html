  Let-3 Role of Department
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">(100-200 words):**
A signed letter to the editor authored by Don Glendenning critiquing PEI&#x27;s education mandate. Don argues that the province&#x27;s role should extend beyond simply delivering school programs to encompassing all lifelong learning experiences. He advocates for a broader provincial mandate including encouraging citizen education, regulating the education service sector, and identifying sectors deserving support. The letter reflects his visionary perspective that education extends beyond schooling, positioning lifelong learning and comprehensive citizen development as essential to provincial prosperity. This document reveals Don&#x27;s willingness to challenge existing frameworks and publicly advocate for systemic educational transformation aligned with his comprehensive philosophy.</div>

<p><b>Dear Editor:</b></p>
<p><b>PEI Education Mandate</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>It is widely recognized that our future as individuals and as a community depends to a large measure on the nature and level of education of our citizens. In saying this, I am using education as an umbrella word and thereby including all learning experiences wherever, whenever and however initiated, carried out and paid for- not just experiences provided by or experienced in school</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>A check on websites shows that most Provinces describe their roles as one of helping young people prepare to function as citizens in a democracy, to gain skills, knowledge and other attributes needed for employment or to prepare young people to advance into postsecondary studies; some Provinces focus on all three. PEI, on the other hand, limits itself to “developing and delivering programs in French and English to Island Children …”. I do not know what that means but it sounds as though the Department’s interest is in simply having youngsters go to school. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>My own view is simple; the Province should:</b></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li2"><b>Encourage all citizens to continue their education</b></li>
  <li class="li2"><b>Regulate the “education service” sector, and</b></li>
  <li class="li2"><b>Identify services and sectors deserving support.</b></li>
</ul>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Put simply, the future of leaving education to schools is not good enough.</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Sincerely</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Don Glendenning</b></p>
