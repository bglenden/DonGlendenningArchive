  2011-14 West Prince
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Don welcomes educational planning for West Prince but criticizes institution-based approaches where schools, colleges, and universities plan independently according to their mandates, leaving gaps. He references a 1969 PEI Teachers&#x27; Convention presentation by Dr. Patrick Watson imagining a community without schools, asking how education needs would be met. Don advocates for comprehensive community-wide educational planning identifying citizen needs rather than institutional offerings, proposing this approach for West Prince or all Islanders. He argues such planning could begin with the Department of Education or any community organization and framing it as a valuable winter project for engagement.</div>

<p>Charlottetown, PEI</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Dear Sir:</p>
<p>Education in West Prince</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I am delighted that the educational needs of the people of West Prince are receiving attention. I</p>
<p>say this for two reasons, education is important, in fact, I believe that a quality education is the</p>
<p>most important issue of the day. Secondly, having a wide range of educational services available</p>
<p>in a community will increase the chances of access by local residents.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>What is happening, however, is a prime example of institution based educational planning. The</p>
<p>School Board, the College and the University each plan programs consistent with their mandate.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, at least in my view, some educational services will likely get left out. What is</p>
<p>needed, I suggest, is an educational plan for all West Prince citizens.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>While writing this, I am reminded of a presentation at the PEI Teachers' Convention, I think, in</p>
<p>1969. The guest speaker was Dr. Patrick Watson, and he described events that he thought</p>
<p>would unfold in a mythical community whose schools had mysteriously disappeared. How</p>
<p>would the community deal with the matter of education of their children? That presentation</p>
<p>certainly provided me with much food for thought.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>It is time for that kind of thinking again, and why not start with the needs of West Prince? Or</p>
<p>better still, an education plan for all lslanders? One may argue that we should have done that</p>
<p>last year or even last month. Perhaps so, but that is history. The fact that we have not done it</p>
<p>yet is not grounds for not doing it now.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The question is not what a school, college or university can provide but rather, what kind of an</p>
<p>education do our citizens need. Although leading such a review is a logical role for a</p>
<p>Department of Education, such an initiative could be started by anyone or any organization. A</p>
<p>discussion of community educational needs would make a great winter project for any</p>
<p>community!</p>

<p>Sincerely</p>
<p><br></p>
