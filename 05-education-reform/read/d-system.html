<div class="reader-summary">Lengthy letter to editor (D-22--4) on &quot;EDUCATION FUNCTIONS.&quot; Don outlines typical education system functions: information and counselling, governance and leadership, instruction, quality assurance, products and technology, funding, and human resources. Critiques PEI&#x27;s confusion of education with schooling, notes lack of benchmarks, and discusses structural issues. References OECD, UNESCO, World Bank on education structure. Proposes education should serve all ages and offer separate services (not just schools). Compares education system to health system model. Represents his most systematic articulation of education system design.</div>

is unclear to me, just what our goals and plans are for education on
PEI.  To a relative newcomer, we seem to confuse going to school with
getting an education, benchmarks are missing, education has become a
product rather than a service and there appears to be little interest
in engaging with the people served.  </b>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 108%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 108%"><b>Education’s
purpose has been described as helping others gain the skills,
knowledge and other attributes needed to flourish in a democratic
society. We get our education by learning, We need to learn in order
to survive; we need to learn more or better in order to thrive. One’s
education is a stage or level of development; a good education has
been described as “a state that allows a person to adequately cope
with all demands of daily life.”  Is this also the basis of a high
school graduation certificate? But we also need people who can lead
and care for this community we call home. Our community believes that
it important for people, especially young people, to learn things
that will help them in later life; school attendance for our
children, therefore, is compulsory. Just what is our commitment to
each person we accept into the school system? </b>

OECD, UNESCO and the World Bank report on how the structure of
education often interferes with the quality of service; I see it as a
clash of cultures.resulting in issues of professional autonomy,
politicization,  bureaucracy, short time horizons. in contrast, it
seems to me that the Depatment of Health seems to hve been able to
more successful in separating the administrative and professional
roles.  </b>

of dollars on education because it believes that education is a good
investment; it is good for a community to have educated citizens
generally but it supports education also in order to have skilled
people to “maintain” PEI as a place we want to live. In this
case, the Province is a purchaser on behalf of its citizens.  The
guidelines used for purchasing are not very well defined, nor are
there any benchmarks.</b></p>
