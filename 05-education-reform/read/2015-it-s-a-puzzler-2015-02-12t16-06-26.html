<div class="reader-summary">Duplicate of the February 2015 Guardian letter articulating Don&#x27;s central education paradox: despite government investment, schools fail to teach basic skills effectively because they neglect learner-centered support. He advocates for outcome-based education, competency frameworks, and challenges the conventional age-grading model used in public schools.</div>

<p>Editor,</p>
<p>Charlottetown Guardian</p>
<p>Charlottetown, PEI	</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Dear Sir:</p>
<p><b>It’s a puzzler<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></b></p>
<p>I had a colleague who often used the word “puzzler” to describe a situation he did not understand; today’s puzzler for me is education; to be more precise, it is the gap between what we know and what we do in education.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Let me explain.</p>
<p>In my framework, educating is a process of helping people prepare for, cope with, contribute to and even enjoy the road of life.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Most of us need all the help we can get.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Decisions as to what to teach, when, how and with what priority should be made in this context.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>I believe that most people can learn most subjects needed to become self-reliant, engaged and productive citizens; it’s just that some require longer or more help to get there, therefore, the school system needs to focus on the timely delivery of needed support rather than organize schools then support is available.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>I believe that levels of achievement in a subject can and should<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>be established, measured and described, and those levels have nothing to do with the age of a learner; I have found no evidence to support the concept of identifying content by age level, or passing or failing<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>student because he or she is ahead or behind another student.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Apprenticeship, music and some sports have found other models that I think work better.</p>
<p>Public schools provide two services to their community, one is a good quality care for our young<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>and the other is help with their education; the latter role is losing its relevancy.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The education component survives because government operates the system and<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>restricts competition.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Of course, I may be wrong, in fact, I’d be happy to be proven wrong; and when that happens, I’ll be glad to write a new letter to the Editor.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>

<p>In the words of the OECD, our public education has two purposes, one to help individuals develop their fullest capacities with the other being to ensure that our communities have the people needed to maintain and improve the way of life.</p>
