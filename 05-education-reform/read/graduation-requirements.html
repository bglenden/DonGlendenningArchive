  Graduation requirements
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">In this essay, Don uses an analogy from his childhood—identifying automobiles and aircraft from a distance—to pose a central question: How does one distinguish an educated person from an uneducated one without examining credentials? He questions whether the pattern of courses required for diplomas or degrees genuinely produces different outcomes. Don examines the Essential Graduation Learnings agreed upon by Atlantic Provinces, proposing these competency-based outcomes as alternatives to traditional course-based requirements. This reflects his belief that education&#x27;s value lies in demonstrable skills, not documentation.</div>

<p><b>HOW TO RECOGNIZE A HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATE</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I grew up near the Chatham airbase and our airspace was used for elementary flying training, air observer training, and practice bombing among other things.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I was reminded of this recently when I came across an “airplane spotters guide’ while sorting memorabilia.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The guide included tips for differentiating among aeroplanes from a great height.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My reminiscing also brought back memories of a contest with my cousin as to who could first accurately identify an approaching automobile.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Obviously one could look at the name but we were pretty good at identifying makes and models even from a great distance.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Seventy years later, after a lifetime in education, I wonder how one distinguishes between an educated and an uneducated person, a schooled and an unschooled person or a person holding a degree with one with a similar length of schooling but one with a degree and one without?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That is, how does one distinguish with out the aid of a transcript, certificate, diploma or degree?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Can an employer distinguish?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Can a university registrar distinguish?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Should any one be able to?.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>If we cannot tell the difference without looking at their documents, why do we make such a to-do about high school, college or university graduation?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Or does the pattern of courses required for the almighty diploma or degree make an appreciable difference in the end product from the same number of courses and credits not resulting in a diploma?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Differentiating between cars was easy – shape, size, features would do the trick.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But how would one differentiate between a graduate and a non- graduate?</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>In seeking an answer, I turned to the Essential Graduation Learnings as agreed on by the four Atlantic Provinces listed below:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Respond with critical awareness to various forms of arts and be able to express themselves through the arts.</p>
<p>Assess social, cultural, economic and environmental interdependence in a loal and global context.</p>
<p>Use the listening, viewing, speaking, reading and writing modes of language(s) and mathematical and scientific concepts and symbols to think, learn and communicate effectively.</p>
<p>Continue to learn and pursue an active, healthy lifestyle.</p>
<p>Use the strategies and processes needed to solve a variety of problems, including those requiring language, mathematical and scientific concepts.</p>
<p>Use a variety of technologies, demonstrate an understanding of technological applications and apply appropriate technologies to solving problems. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
