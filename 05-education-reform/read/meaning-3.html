<div class="reader-summary">A comprehensive essay examining education&#x27;s definition, Don argues PEI needs to articulate how the education system defines education. His literature review found no published PEI definition. He presents examples from authoritative sources: Good&#x27;s Dictionary (education as social process for competence); OECD (organic, sustained communication for learning); Anonymous (experience with formative effect); Ontario (act of teaching and receiving knowledge). Don emphasizes that education is complex; learners have varied interests, experiences, capabilities, needs, and life roles. Teachers/educators must communicate clearly. Conceptual clarity heightens understanding of key concepts; lack of clarity must be directly addressed. He notes the absence of definitions may signal disagreement about education&#x27;s meaning and mission, suggesting some resist definition due to lack self-confidence. This essay synthesizes Don&#x27;s extended analysis into a substantial policy statement.</div>

<p>MEANING OF EDUCATION</p>

<p>Prince Edward Island needs a definition of education; perhaps more accurately, Islanders should know how the PEI education system defines education. My reading of the PEI literature did not reveal one. Whether we agree or not, just having a definition will help us to think and communicate more clearly, avoid misunderstanding and to understand the people we serve, the services we provide, product, process and values. This is especially important when the subject itself carries layers of subjectivity. The process of assigning meaning enhances both precision and clarity.</p>
<p>Some examples:</p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li2">Good- the social process by which people are subject to the influence of a select and controlled environment so that they can attain social competence and optimum individual development</li>
  <li class="li2">OECD – organic and sustained communication to bring about learning</li>
  <li class="li2">Anon - any experience that has a formative effect on the way a person thinks feels or acts.</li>
  <li class="li2">Ontario – both the act of teaching knowledge to others and the act of receiving knowledge from someone else.</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>There is a view that ducation I’ve been asked by a senior educator where I got my education; that implies education as a product rather than a process. . . The World Bank cautions countries about confusing education and “going to school. The absence of definitions may signify differences of opinion as to Education’s meaning and mission.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Education is complex.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Learners have different interests, experiences, capabilities and needs. Learners also fill a variety of life roles. Those who teach, or otherwise serve learners, must be very clear in their communication. Conceptual clarity heightens our understanding of key words and concepts; lack of clarity should be addressed directly so that the concept of education won’t become diluted and potentially ineffective. Lack of clarity may arise from an idea itself, from the person promoting the idea or from the person receiving the idea; Lack of clarity could also signal conflicting ideas and level of discomfort or disagreement from within the group itself; some say the willingness to define is related to self-confidence. <span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></p>
