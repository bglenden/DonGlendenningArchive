  Along Came Jesus
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Don&#x27;s scholarly essay examining the history, geography, and politics of the biblical period (BCE and ACE) without attempting to prove or disprove theological claims. The work synthesizes learning from approximately fifteen sources and includes a glossary of terms related to Hebrew, Judaism, and biblical history.</div>

<b>INTRODUCTION</b></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">One
of my resolutions for 2009 was to increase my knowledge of Bible
times with a focus on the period just before immediately before and
immediately after the Common <br />
Era (BCE and ACE). It is not my
interest or intention to try to prove or disprove that Jesus was born
of the Virgin Mary, was crucified, rose from the dead and ascended
into heaven although I expect to encounter many differing views on
the subject and will likely report on some of them.  Instead, I have
tried to focus on the history, geography, politics, etc of the
period. Since then I have engaged a number of people in conversation
and read or at least reviewed some fifteen books and references.  My
learning style requires that I write in order to remember.  What
follows is a summary of my findings and conclusions.

<br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">The
story as told in the Bible begins with creation, with Adam and Even
in the Garden of Eden, through their descendants, Cain and Abel, down
through Noah and the flood finally focusing on Abraham and his family
and descendants.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<ul>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
	As reported, Abraham, the first Patriarch, was living in Ur, in
	southern Mesopotamia which is to the East of Jerusalem a distance of
	xxx miles.  The Bible reports that Abraham was called by God to
	found a nation.  He together with his wife, Sarah, and some family
	members, left home and traveled west, as his God had commanded,
	eventually settling in the land of Canaan.  Abraham’s youngest
	son, Isaac, was born when Abraham was 100 years old</p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
	Canaan was a strip of land, about 150 mils long and fifty miles
	wide, wedged between between  the Easern end of the Mideiterranean
	Sea and the Lebanon(?) Mountains.  The soil was fertile and fed by
	streams from the mountains.   Canaan was about midway between the
	large trading centres of Babylon and Egypt; it was a meeting place
	of many cultures</p></li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<ul>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
	Jacob, a son of Isaac and Grandson of Abraham, had a “struggle
	with God” and took the name, Israel, married and had 12 sons;
	thereafter Jacob’s (Israel’s) sons and followers became known as
	Israelites.  Each of Jacob’s sons became head, of one of the
	tribes of Israel.  According to the bible, they were a fractious
	group and engaged in a great deal of infighting.  
	</p></li>

</p>
<ul>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
	Canaan was struck by a major famine and, according to the Bible,
	Jacob and his 12 sons took refuge in Egypt.  About 400 years later,
	Moses led the descendants of Abraham, the 12 tribes, out of Egypt
	and back to Canaan, the Promised Land where they lived in relative
	harmony for 4-500 years..</p></li>

The other two tribes settled in the South and called it Judah. It
lasted a bout 300 years before being captured by Babylon in 600 BC. 
Not surprising remanents of the tribes continued to live in their
conquered lands

	One of the things that makes Judaism and Christianity interesting is
	that it told of real people and real struggles within themselves,
	with their neighbours and with their God.  They were not mythical
	people but real people dealing with a personal god</p></li>

	According to Finklestein, before the development of Judah and likely
	Israel as well into a full bureaucratic state in the 8<sup>th</sup>
	century BCE, religious ideas were diverse and widespread and a
	mixing of YHWH with other gods; with the development of the states
	came a parallel strengthening of religious view, practices and a
	heightened role for Jerusalem   including a defining of proper order
	of worship.  This was a time also for a movement from oral to
	written texts.</p></li>
