<p>Occasional Paper No.4		<span class="Apple-converted-space">                        			                                                </span>July 15, 2015</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>To better understand the learning process, Education 20/20 convened a workshop, <span>From a Learner’s Perspective,</span> and invited a panel of young people to identify the kinds of support they found most helpful.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Not surprising, a long list of steps emerged with these steps being chief among them: gather information, analyze experiences, obtain feedback, take instruction, evaluate selves, coach others, practice, observe others, attend lectures, seek counselling and observe demonstrations.	</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Panellists were then asked identify the order in which help was needed not surprisingly, students followed quite different paths.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As an example, one student said his first step would be to Google the topic; another said if it involved a new skill, he would probably attempt it first, while others liked the traditional lecture as a place to start.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Since panel members were in school or recent graduates, much of the discussion revolved around gaining new knowledge rather than skills or attitudes. Later we identified five major steps along the learning path: (1) Deciding to learn, (2) Exploring options, (3) attempting the task, (4) using help and (5) reaching expectations.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Different purposes for learning did not substantially change the range of help needed, although it may change the order and the amount of time on the path. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The Learning Path was the subject of many informal consultations, plus an Early Childhood Education class at Holland College.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The las consultation was an open discussion with a group of some 25 mostly experience educators with an enlarged copy of the graph on as the centre of discussion.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Participants in the most recent discussion focused on two major issues “Why are we developing a Learning Path?” responses included to “summarize’ where we are at in our thinking about the learning process”, to “model the process of how we learn” to better understand, and as a tool to help us explain the learning process to others.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The second theme of the discussion dealt with “motivation, incentives, the affective domain, collaboration, and learning style.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The development of a learning path grew out of the belief that learning is a process, that the steps that learners take can be identified and charted, and that a clear understanding of the support needed is an important for teachers and parents alike.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Although we said that we would redraw the chart and attach it as part of this document; on further reflection, however, decided that while it was a great discussion, there was insufficient clear direction to make changes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The path is far from complete; it is not a finished product, perhaps it never will be.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Its value is in the discussion that it generated.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Our thanks to:<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Tanya Craig for convening and chairing the initial Youth Panel, Panel members Callen Cudmore, Ryan Rioux, Iain Cudmore and Stephanie Mayne, to Holly Moses and the second year students in the Early Childhood Education class at Holland College; Mike Chapman for<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>facilitating discussion, and the many others who provided assistance along the way.	<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If even one reader refers to it in s discussion of education, it will have served its original purpose.					<b>	</b></p>
