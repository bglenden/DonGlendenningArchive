  2 Labour market
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Glendenning expresses concerns about the federal-to-provincial transfer of labour market training funds, warning against provincial training becoming subject to political patronage and local rather than national workforce mobility. He advocates for employer and employee groups to lead public discussion on appropriate policies and priorities. His analysis reflects concern that without federal oversight, training funds might be misallocated and that smaller provinces like PEI need to train workers for national and international competition, not just local needs. The letter shows his grasp of macroeconomic workforce development.</div>

<p>Dear Editor:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Labour Market Training</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Recently the federal government has agreed to the transfer of "labour market training" to provincial governments. The change involves both the transfer of responsibility and dollars. This amounts, I believe, to several million dollars. The change also involves the transfer of staff from HRDC to the Province. Some of the money comes from Ul premiums - money contributed by both employers and workers. On the surface, it makes sense that a Province have control of trainer of adults for and in the labour force, however, I have some concerns. These concerns arise, at least in part, from the fact that there has been little public discussion of this matter on PEl.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>While talk of the technological age frequently turns to the need for more science and engineering graduates, little is heard of the crucial role which will be played by our skilled workforce. That is why the use of these funds is so important to our future. Even now we read that a neighbouring province is having difficulty finding technically trained people. The transfer of responsibility to a province, by itself makes the training of skilled workers neither better nor worse. The transfer, however, provides an opportunity to review the activity and consider changes which will serve us even better.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The Government of Canada has been supporting adult training for more than B decades; when federal dollars dried up so did the training. By and large Provinces, especially the smaller ones, spent few provincial dollars on adult training. Provincial dollars were allocated to universities, post-grade 12 programs<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>in community colleges, and the public school system. With all its faults, federaL funding did ensure that workforce preparation received both attention and support. lt is important that those assuming the new responsibility give the matter at least equal attention.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>We must ensure that the dollars transferred for training will be spent on the training of adults either entering or now in the workforce. Funds could well end up paying for pavement.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The loss of federal direction may well result in decreased worker mobility as individual provinces train only for local needs. And this at a time when mobility of a trained labour force is essential. I believe that lslanders should receive training which will allow them to compete fcr work anywhere in Canada or even internationally, we must take also that worthy candidates, especially those not drawing benefits do not fall through the cracks.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Decision making by local counsellors may be even more susceptible to pressures to give priority to supporters of the party in power rather than the most deserving adults. A provincial public servant, regardless of how professional, is vulnerable to pressures from a Local MLA in the decision-rnaking process. Federal public servants are much further removed from politicians than are provincial ones.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>It seems to me that this whole matter needs a great deal of public discussion as to appropriate policies,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>procedures, priorities, etc. Since the money is intended to prepare people for the workforce, for the workforce, it is logical that the public discussion be led by employer and employee groups. I think that they, plus individual lslanders, have the most to gain - or the most to lose.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
<p><br></p>
