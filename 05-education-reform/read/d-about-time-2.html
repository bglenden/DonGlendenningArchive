  D About Time-2
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Don contrasts how service industries allocate time based on customer needs with how education allocates time regardless of learner needs. In other sectors, providers estimate required time, book resources, deliver service, and complete. Education does the reverse: allocates fixed time regardless of whether students need more or less, penalizes early completion, and makes students repeat entire courses if they need additional time. He critiques this fundamental inefficiency and notes that education is unique in this dysfunctional approach to time allocation. The letter reflects his service management perspective and his observation that educational systems lag behind business practices in customer-responsive operations.</div>

<p>Dear Sir:</p>
<p><b>About time</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>I had an interesting conversation recently about the way the school system allocates time as compared to other sectors.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Education has yet to discover how to budget time to the advantage of learners.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Most service industries identify an outcome whether fixing your car, taking your case to court or treating an injury, estimate the time required book people and facilities, perform the service and send you home.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Educators do the reverse; they tell you how much time is available to help but seldom ask what you need or want; keep you in class for<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>the time allocated whether or not you need it,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>in fact, if you leave early, you may be penalized through lower grades or even the loss of credit or diploma.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>On the other hand, schools cannot allow more time on task even if needed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Chances are thatif you need more time to finish you must wait until the next year and even theun it not<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>possible to pick up where he left off but instead must start<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>at the beginning a year later.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>This could only happen in education; if you want to send a note, I’ll certainly make time for your comments</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
<p><br></p>
