  2015 School closings  
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Don defends small schools against closure recommendations, citing research showing they foster cooperation, improve attendance, strengthen student engagement, and build self-reliance. He argues that while rural schools are often targeted for closure, evidence suggests small schools provide superior educational outcomes. He proposes giving small schools autonomy in scheduling, grouping, staffing, and technology access rather than eliminating them, and suggests prioritizing educational services by their impact on student learning while eliminating less essential offerings.</div>

<p>Dear Sir:</p>
<p><b>School Closings</b></p>
<p>While public school enrolments have been declining for several years, budgets have continued to rise; it shouldn’t be a surprise, therefore, that some hard decisions will have to be made, including the closing of some schools.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In so doing, however, we shouldn’t forget that small schools often serve rural populations better than large ones.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A quick scan of the literature suggests that small schools foster cooperation, usually have better attendance, often have a high level of engagement and are good at helping students build self- esteem and self-reliance; teachers in small schools usually like them as well.</p>
<p>Actually, small schools may be at the heart of providing a quality education in a rural province like PEI.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But to fill that role effectively they need autonomy in their day to day operation, greater access to technology, ability to adjust school schedules, freedom to group differently and different staffing and management patterns.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In my educational journey, I discovered Alberta with 22 Charter schools, all small, all with significant autonomy, and all competing with public schools in the quality of their programs; I visited a high school once that exchanged 7 teaching positions for 14 teaching assistant position and the school ranking in the district rose dramatically; I read of a small school, I believe it was in Michigan, that decided to do without a principal and operate more like a professional office.</p>
<p>Another way to cut costs is to list all educational services that students need, together with the cost of providing them, rank the items in order of importance to learners and learning, and drop the services that contribute least to effective education. While these may be difficult times for people in education, they could also be the challenge that’s needed to spur improvement.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p><br></p>
