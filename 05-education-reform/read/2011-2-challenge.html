  2011-2 Challenge
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">This foundational piece proposes replacing PEI&#x27;s batch graduation system with a continuous-flow credential model. Don argues that students learn at different rates and should be able to challenge for credit at any time rather than waiting for cohort graduation dates. He notes that schools already have examination frameworks, assessment instruments, and processes in place twice yearly, requiring only administrative restructuring. The proposal would allow students to complete requirements flexibly through work, employment, additional coursework, or travel while potentially reducing costs and foregone earnings. Don emphasizes that achievement of standards should be the goal, not time-serving compliance.</div>

<p>Dear Editor:</p>
<p><b>Challenge for Credit</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>High school graduation is just around the corner; on a day in June, hundreds of young people</p>
<p>will complete their studies and move into a new stage of life. I often marvel that all high school</p>
<p>students qualify for "graduation" on exactly the same day. Setting aside a day to celebrate the</p>
<p>achievement is one thing but to pretend that the achievement by so many students occurs on</p>
<p>the same day is quite another.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>My studies taught that students learn at different rates, and we should try to accommodate</p>
<p>their differences. Why, therefore, must all students attend school for the same number of</p>
<p>days? When students reach the required standard, why not grant credit and let them move on?</p>
<p>Moving on may mean going to work, taking additional courses, enrolling in college or university, traveling, or whatever students do at that age.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Schools already have an examination framework. Graduation requirements are already</p>
<p>described in school documents, examination and assessment instruments and procedures are</p>
<p>available, and the process is implemented now at least twice yearly. The above may need some</p>
<p>tweaking, but I am simply proposing a change from the current batch process to a continuous</p>
<p>flow process. Perhaps we need an examination service or "examination centre" separate from</p>
<p>schools - and even charge an additional fee, but these are details.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Allowing students to challenge for credit could reduce actual costs to a student as well as reduce foregone earnings. When I propose this to fellow teachers, they usually respond by telling me that it would be impossible to administer. Maybe so, but would there be a benefit to allowing it?</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Of course, the reverse is also true. Some students may need a bit longer to reach the standard.</p>
<p>So let them stay a bit longer. Achieving the standard should be the objective, not serving time.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
