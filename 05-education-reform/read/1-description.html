  1 Description 
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Expanded conceptual framework for achievement levels emphasizing the distinction between age-based grade levels and achievement proficiency. Opens with extended discussion of growing recognition that current proficiency assessment systems are fundamentally flawed, citing No Child Left Behind, labour mobility requirements, technology impact, and public school standard erosion. Argues teaching and qualification should separate functions; contrasts education&#x27;s self-standard-setting with external standard-setting in food inspection, standards associations, and health departments. References examples of separated functions (apprenticeships, Canadian Language Authority, IB Program, music conservatory). Introduces critical insight: Sydney Morning Herald article about 8-year achievement spreads in mathematics classrooms, arguing schools have choice between adjusting time or adjusting learning expectations. Proposes terminology change from &quot;grade&quot; (administrative) to &quot;level&quot; (achievement-based), enabling students to take mixed-level courses within same age cohort.</div>

<p><b>Proficiency levels in education</b></p>
<p><b>Description-1-B</b></p>
<p><span>Background</span></p>
<p><span></span><br></p>
<p>There is a growing recognition that the current system for establishing levels of proficiency in education is flawed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Recent years have seen a significant increase in the level of concern about educational standards and school assessment; reasons for the rising interest include the “No child Left Behind” legislation in the US, movement of<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>labour from one region to another as well as internationally, impact of technology-aided instruction and assessment, and the perceived erosion of public school standards.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There is also an emerging view that, while formative assessment is certainly part of the teaching function, summative or high stakes testing is not.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>While there are likely many reason, the two most obvious are the manner in which standards are arrived at and the fact that both teaching and grading falls on the same shoulders, those of teachers.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>While every organization has concern for the quality of the goods and services it delivers, for most, the standard to be met is set by a body other than the producer or provider,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The Canadian Food Inspection Agency, Canadian Standards Association and the PEI health Department set standards of care in their respective areas.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>While education generally sets its own standards, one can also find examples of a separate standards setting bodies such as apprenticeship where schools train but Departments of Labour certify, the Canadian Language authority, the International Baccalaureate Program and the Canadian Conservatory of Music.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Internationally, most countries, except Canada and the US, have qualification authorities that fulfil the qualification function</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>We are of the view that The act of teaching and that of establishing qualification levels in PEI should be separated; In addition to improving the quality of evaluations, we believe that a separate qualification authority for education, will reduces bias, improves consistency, and reduces teacher workload</p>

<p><b>School Achievement Levels <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>The Sydney Morning Herald of Saturday, July 22, 2015, carried an item based on a report by the Grattan Institute on the wide range of achievement levels in a typical classroom in Australian schools.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In Math, for example, the range could be as much as 8 years.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I’m told that the same applies to classrooms in PEI and results in both frustrated teachers and frustrated students. The article concludes, and I quote: “… it is not possible to remove the spread of grade levels and, therefore, teaching methods must be adjusted.” <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>There are at least two flaws in that line of thinking:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li7"><b>Grade level and achievement are not the same</b>:<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Grade levels are primarily administrative arrangements for counting students, recording the amount and nature of instruction provided, and the length of time students are under instruction. Achievement levels, on the other hand, refer to the level of learning reached in a field, subject or topic by a student irrespective of age, where learned or length of time spent in study.</li>
</ul>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li7"><b>Which constant?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span></b>Schools have a choice: set a standard and adjust the time needed to reach it, or set time limits and measure achievement in the time available. Schools have chosen to make time the constant; the result is varying levels of achievement. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Achievement levels</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>As I write these words, I’ve just finished a conversation, the third in three days, about reporting student achievement; to be more specific, about the confusion arising from the practice of applying two meanings to the word “grade”.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Labelling students by grade has been a feature of schools since the beginning, with the great majority of students moving each year from grade to grade with their peers.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Such an arrangement allows students to build and share interests and experiences during their formative years; it’s part of a school’s culture. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>But the word “grade” has another meaning, this one is a level of achievement in a field of study – grade six math, for example.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We know that students learn at different rates, so it is not surprising that teachers report subject-matter gaps of 4, 6 or even 8 years in an age group. It is impossible to close that gap, as a result:</p>
<p><br></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li11">Students who do well, become bored.</li>
  <li class="li11">Students who fall behind, become discouraged.</li>
  <li class="li11">Teachers become frustrated.</li>
  <li class="li11">Parents wonder what is going on.</li>
  <li class="li11">The value of a graduation diploma falls.</li>
  <li class="li11">The public loses faith in the public school system.</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p>It’s time to select a different word to identify levels of achievement; but, “level” appears to be the preferred word. Changing the term would allow a student to study any subject at any level.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As a result, a grade 11 student could be taking level 7 math, level 4 physics and level 6 literature. The International Baccalaureate program does it, the Canadian Red Cross does it for swimming, some qualification authorities do it, and so should the public school system.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
