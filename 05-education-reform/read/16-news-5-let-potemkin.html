  16 News 5 Let Potemkin
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Letter to Charlottetown Guardian (February 12, 2017) using the historical metaphor of Potemkin villages (portable facades built to impress Catherine the Great in 1787) to critique PEI education system improvements. Don questions whether education system changes represent genuine quality improvements versus superficial &quot;Potemkin&quot; reforms. He references UNICEF 2000 quality education characteristics (relevant content, autonomous schools, accountable teachers, learning-linked outcomes, learner-focused support) and wonders if measured improvement constitutes authentic system transformation. This demonstrates his skeptical, analytically sharp approach to evaluating education policy rhetoric versus reality.</div>

<p>Editor,</p>
<p>Charlottetown Guardian</p>
<p>Charlottetown, PEI	</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Dear Sir:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>	<b>	 <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><span><b>Is education a </b></span><b>Potemkin village?</b><b></b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span>A “potemkin village”</span> gets its name from portable villages built along<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>the Dnieper River in 1787; they were built to impress Catherine the Great during her journey to Crimea. Each day after the Empress passed, the structures were dismantled, moved down river and erected again for her benefit, the objective was to demonstrate all the good work of the governor of the region.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A colleague likens changes in our education system to a potemkin façade. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I was vaguely aware of the term, introoducdThe term, potemkin village, was first used by a friend a number of years ago when describing education of the day; I have not heard or used the term since until a few days ago when I recalled the conversation and reacquainted myself with the story.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There may be more similarity than I care to admit. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Below are some characteristics of a quality education system as identified by UNICEF in the year 2000; readers, especially those with children still in the public school system, can make their own judgements about<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>the level of improvement in each:</p>
<p>Content is more relevant</p>
<p>Schools are more autonomous</p>
<p>Teachers are more accountable</p>
<p>Outcomes are linked to personal objectives</p>
<p>Support is focused on learners and learning</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I’m not sure that measuring improvement in quality qualifies as “potemkiness”, but this is the term that came to mind as I reflected on the degree of educational change in recent months.</p>
