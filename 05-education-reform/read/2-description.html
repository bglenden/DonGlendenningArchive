  2 Description
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Policy description addressing public concerns about education quality with emphasis on standards-setting conflict. Documents that public views education system as flawed due to educator-controlled standard setting (unlike other industries where external bodies establish standards), large-scale assessment results, economic competency concerns, system quality changes (grade inflation, social promotion, report card confusion), awareness of alternative approaches, teaching-grading function conflicts, and technology-aided instruction impact. Identifies nearly 2,000 PEI achievement evaluators creating inconsistency. Distinguishes between grade (age-based administrative grouping) and achievement (learning level), emphasizing confusion from dual-meaning usage. Reviews best practices (apprenticeships, International Baccalaureate, music/swimming, mathematical competitions, credential systems, language levels, qualification authorities). Specifies needed qualification authority characteristics including independence, bias reduction, consistency improvement, workload reduction, and conflict elimination.</div>

<p><b>Achievement levels in education</b></p>
<p>3-9-1-2</p>
<p>Public have major concerns about the quality of public education:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>School standards:</b> for most products and services are established by or in consultation with users or the government acting on</p>
<p>Their behalf; not so in the public education system where those who teach, not only set the standards but measure</p>
<p>and determine the level reached by students served. ln the views of the writer this not only constitutes a conflict of</p>
<p>interest but casts doubt on the quality of the product.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Large scale assessment -rrcaselsjeFtbe rising interest include the "No child Left Behind" legislation in the US, Labour mobility, impact oftechnology instruction and assessmen! the perceived erosion of public school</p>
<p>standards. Adult literacy levels, the performance of lsland students on large scale assessments including PCAP and PISA</p>
<p>Perception that our economy is suffering because of either the lack of skilled workers or their education levelt</p>
<p>Education system chantes - levels are less clear grade inflation, social promotion, report cards Confusion over the issue</p>
<p>of school standards is further confused, some would say exacerbated, by the practice of using grade level to mean "a</p>
<p>group of learners of the same age" as well as "a level of achisvaluators -</p>
