  21-2-E  RESTRUCTURING
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Final restructuring version framing education mandate critique. Don notes widespread recognition that community future depends on citizen education levels. Surveys provincial mandates showing most focus on democratic citizenship, employment skills, and postsecondary preparation; PEI uniquely defines role narrowly as &quot;developing and delivering programs in French and English to Island Children.&quot; He advocates both structural and cultural reform, arguing deep government embedment dampens communication, collaboration, autonomy, accountability, and service quality. Calls for structural overhaul, referencing international authority (OECD, World Bank, UNESCO, Montreal Economic Institute) and local stakeholders. Concludes with rallying rhetoric: &quot;Our future lies in our hands. Let&#x27;s take back our future.&quot;</div>

<p><b>Dear Editor:</b></p>
<p><b>PEI education Mandate</b></p>
<p><b>21-2-E</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>It is widely recognized that our future as individuals and as a community depends to a large measure on the nature and level of education of our citizens. In saying this, I am using education as an umbrella word and thereby including all learning experiences wherever, whenever and however initiated, carried out and paid for- not just experiences provided by or experienced in school</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>A check on websites shows that most Provinces describe their roles as one of helping people prepare to function as citizens in a democracy, to gain skills, knowledge and other attributes needed for employment or to prepare young people to advance into postsecondary studies; some Provinces include all three. PEI, on the other hand, sees its role as one of<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“developing and delivering programs in French and English to Island Children …”. I find this a very narrow mandate and unlikely to accommodate or support the kind and level of education needed by our citizens in the years ahead.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>My own conclusions are that public education needs both structural and cultural reform; the nature and extent of embedment of education in government seems to have put a damper on communication, collaboration, autonomy, accountability and service thereby lessening our community as a place we call home. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Calls for change are not new. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I first heard about structural impediments in the education system a few years ago from a PEI trustee. Then in 2011, the OECD recommended more autonomy to schools for their day- to- day operation as a way to improve PISA test results. in 2018, the World Bank, the largest funder of educational services in the world, spoke about improving an education system by delegating certain operational practices to schools and intermediary bodies.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Montreal Economic Institute reported that autonomy and accountability “jointly applied” are key factors in school achievement”. A few weeks ago, a friend forwarded information from UNESCO about the structure of educational services.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And that’s not to forget a “Call for Action” by Education 2020 Inc. in 2015, newspaper items and the many comments from retired educators and Island citizens at large. And I’ve encountered the “fear factor’	</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>What are we waiting for.</b></p>
<p><b>Our future lies in our hands</b></p>
<p><b>Let’s take back our future</b></p>
<p><b>A few simple steps today</b></p>
<p><b>Become the architect for change</b></p>
