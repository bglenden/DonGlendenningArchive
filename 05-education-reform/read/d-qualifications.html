  D Qualifications  
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Don identifies a fundamental mismatch: government invests over $200 million annually in schools, yet employers report skill gaps and jobs go unfilled. Schools issue credentials describing what was studied; employers want qualifications indicating what was learned. He notes many countries (excepting US and Canada) have established qualification frameworks administered by independent authorities with standardized, nationally-recognized qualifications. He calls for Canada to establish similar framework, starting with basic skills standardization. This demonstrates his evidence-based approach and willingness to learn from international comparative practices.</div>

<p>Dear Sir:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><b>Employers want to know what’s been learned</b></p>
<p>I’ve been trying to understand the cause of the basic skills gap on Prince Edward Island.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>On the one hand, taxpayers spend over $200 million on our public school system each year; on the other hand, employers tell us that jobs go begging for lack of skills.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It certainly sounds like a mismatch.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In addition to technical skills and knowledge, employees need a certain level of “basic skills” to function in the workplace and the lack of these basic skills has a negative impact on the employee, the employer and our economy. Schools issue credentials that describe what has been studied.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Employers want to know a person’s qualifications, what has been learned.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Therein lies the problem. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Whereas, Canada depend on credentials issued by schools, many countries, the US and Canada being exceptions, have established a “qualification framework”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>administered by a qualification authority; qualification authorities design and implement standards that reflect what has been learned, qualifications instantly recognized across the country.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Designs differ but each country can decide the nature and scope of qualifications system to suit its own purposes.</p>
<p>A qualification framework for Canada is long overdue and standardizing levels of basic skills would be a good place to start.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In addition to supporting worker mobility, such a system would reduce a school’s workload.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p><br></p>
