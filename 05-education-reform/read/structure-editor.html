impediments</b></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.11in; line-height: 108%">The structure of
public education includes some impediments to improvement.  I heard
this first from a PEI school trustee; later exploration confirmed it.
Education is complex; learners have different interests,
capabilities, experiences and needs; so does a community.  Islanders
fill a variety of life roles; graduation requirements and essential
skills don’t match; the education system is embedded like no other
within the government structure.  And the focus on services has waned
along with professional freedom. Quality improvement demands change.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.11in; line-height: 108%">In 2015,
Education 2020 Inc. called for a clear and compelling vision of
education for all Islanders; we are still waiting.  Department
documents tell us that Government interest is primarily in helping
young people “find a place in society”; that is not a clear
enough purpose on which to build an education system. The Department
of Education gives its role as that of “developing and delivering
programs and curriculum” to young people – what Islanders need is
skills, knowledge, attitudes and values to help them along life’s
road.   In a 20i9 report, The World Bank cautioned about the
confusion of treating “education and going to school” as though
they are one and the same; a review of PEI education documents
suggests that PEI has also fallen into that trap. A school, like a
hospital or shopping plaza at best, is only a resource rich location;
education is the result of changes that occur in those who
participate.  
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.11in; line-height: 108%"> “Form follows
function” is still the standard when structuring any venture, and
successful service organizations require significant freedom at the
point of service delivery. In support of this view, the OECD tells us
that PISA results are better in schools with autonomy in their day to
day operation;  the World Bank advises Ministries of Education to
delegate. Mathew Bedard of the Montreal Economic Institute  points
out that “autonomy and accountability jointly applied” would cost
practically nothing and allow education to better adapt to the
diversity of student needs and aptitudes.  Functional restructuring
would highlight instruction, counselling, information, learning
materials and technology rather than yje running of
schools.Restructuring is overdue and should highlight its services
rather than its clients.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.11in; line-height: 108%">Organizational
accountability is about defining a mission, values and  goals and
everyone’s role in accomplishing them. Accountability starts with
clarity and includes a high level of trust, collaboration and
connections. The writer’s search failed to retrieve information
that describes teacher and principal duties and responsibilities; I’m
left with the impression that teachers invariably public conversation
and reports focus on system shortcoming my perception, however,  is
that teachers lack both freedom and encouragement to take action on
their own. changes that occur with people. Accountabiliies in the
health field provide an interesting alternative.</p>
