</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Follow-up letter to Ray Murphy updating him on Education 20/20&#x27;s progress and requesting sustained support for 2013 activities. Don reiterates that meaningful change requires rethinking education fundamentals and system structure. He reports activities underway: early childhood education workshops with recognized practitioners, school-community engagement software testing (recognizing research linking engagement to achievement), school award program development, educator dialogue on reading skills gaps, and public information initiatives to address education&#x27;s communication deficit. Don sets a $25,000 budget for 2013 initiatives and requests either one-time or three-year commitments from supporters. Community Foundation of PEI administers funds and issues tax receipts.</div>

<p><br></p>
<p>Dear Mr. Murphy:		</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>This is a follow-up to my original letter of November 9 about the need for change in education and our efforts to make change happen.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I cannot overstate the importance of education both for individuals and for the future of our community and country.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Doing more of the same is not an answer; we need a fundamental change in thinking about what constitutes an education and the role of schools.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We know at least some of the steps that must be taken, more autonomy for schools, less bureaucracy, greater freedom and accountability for teachers, more attention to the preschool years, greater choice among providers and changes in standards and reporting. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The attached copies of my last two letters to the Editor may be of interest.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Since my original letter, I am pleased to report that Education 20/20 Inc.:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li8">Has organized a workshop on Early Childhood Education.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A panel comprised practitioners whose leadership is recognized, spoke of on approaches that work; participants included other early childhood workers, parents, educators and members of the community at large.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We plan to offer workshops in other Island communities in the months ahead.</li>
  <li class="li8">Is aware of the evidence that the engagement of family, students, teachers and other members of the community results in better student grades.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We plan to test a new software package, developed in Canada, to see if it can provide information of value in this regard.</li>
  <li class="li8">Is actively planning to make an award to an Island school that best exemplifies the concept of engagement in its regular activities. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A consultation on the criteria for such an award is planned early in the new year.</li>
  <li class="li8">Has begun the process of engaging educators, especially decision makers, in a regular dialogue about educational issues with the low level of reading skills being high on our list.</li>
  <li class="li8">Notes that, compared with health for example, there is little information available to the public about education.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We want to change that and are exploring ways to reduce the “public information gap” probably through a variety of electronic , print and social media activities.</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Our group cannot make this happen alone; we are now looking for partners and supporters.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We have set a budget of $25,000 to carry out the above initiatives in 2013, excluding any administrative costs.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Any contribution will be appreciated, however, for planning purposes a three year commitment would be most helpful.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>We are pleased to be able to say that the Community Foundation of Prince Edward Island supports this educational initiative and will administer our funds., therefore, contributions<b> </b>to<b> Education 20/20 Inc</b>. should be directed to the Foundation (Community Foundation of Prince Edward Island, 119 Queen Street, Charlottetown, PE<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>C1A 4B3) who will issue charitable receipts.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I thank you in advance for your consideration and would welcome an opportunity to meet, to discuss your ideas and concerns about education, and our plans to respond.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I’ll be in touch within the next few days seeking an appointment to talk further.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Wishing you the compliments of the season.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Don Glendenning</p>
<p>President</p>
