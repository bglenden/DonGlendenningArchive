<div class="reader-summary">Don&#x27;s comprehensive &quot;Key Definitions&quot; document (February 2, 2023) providing his taxonomy of education concepts. Includes detailed definitions of: learner (with three pieces of &quot;luggage&quot;—natural conditions, prior learning, aspirations), learning (multidimensional, experiential process), education (result of formative experiences), education system (community services supporting development), teaching (arranging experiences), schools (group-based facilities), school system (district reporting), educated (capability in everyday life), and life roles (individual, family member, student, citizen, consumer, producer). This represents the most complete expression of Don&#x27;s educational philosophy.</div>

<p><b>Education in Canada is a provincial responsibility; the role of a Province is to encourage, support and regulate education services; in the case of PEI. although ducation services are not separately identified they appear to be mainly delivered through schools, college. universities and private schools. Although the system allows for independent study the writer is unsure at the moment just how that works. Like most Provinces, PEI appears to be serviced by a school system rather than an education system. Growing numbers of independent learners will likely demand changes.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b>While it is likely that a taxonomy of common education terms used in PEI exists, the writer did not come across one; the following reflects the writer’s views on key education concepts:</b></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li1"><b>Learner – a person who, for whatever reason, needs, wants or is trying to bring about change in his/her life – trying to change an acritude, gain new knowledge, or add skills. But learners are neither empty jars nor blank slates; each learner carries three pieces of luggage to every new learning situation (1) certain physical, mental and emotional conditions with which a learner is born, (b) prior learning resulting from home circumstances, formal study, travel, state of health, personal interests, culture in which learner operates and (3) aspirations and imagined future including where one will live, the work one will do and the lifestyle one will have, nature of the family, quality of life, etc. . Learners have different interests, experiences, capabilities and needs. Learners also fill a variety of life roles, that of an individual, family member, student, citizen, consumer and producer</b></li>
  <li class="li1"><b>Learning- a process of engaging in experiences that have a formative effect on the way we think, feel and act. Learning is multidimensional; it can happen any place and any time, when one is alone as well as when people gather together, it may be satisfied by something as simple as a bit of information or as complex as understanding the laws of the universe. Although only the learner can learn, learning may occur in group setting</b></li>
  <li class="li1"><b>Education-one’s education is the result of experiences that have had a measurable effect on one’s life – of one’s thoughts, actions and feelings</b></li>
  <li class="li1"><b>Education System- a set of services put in place by a community to encourage and support the development of its people</b></li>
  <li class="li1"><b>Teaching - arranging experiences for others resulting in changes to what they know, believe, feel and are able to do.</b></li>
  <li class="li1"><b>Schools – although learning is an individual matter, schools are designed to deal with groups.</b></li>
  <li class="li1"><b>School system- schools in a district reporting to a single senior executive member</b></li>
  <li class="li1"><b>Educated means the extent to which person can deal satisfactorily with issues that arise in their everyday lives.</b></li>
  <li class="li1"><b>Life roles –based on Oregon Education study that each person fills six life roles – individual, family member, student, citizen, consumer and producer. Education can support any and all</b></li>
</ul>
