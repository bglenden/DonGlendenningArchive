  D Schoools Act  @2016-05-06T03;21;07
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Don critiques PEI&#x27;s new Education Act as misnamed because it addresses schools rather than education broadly, and notes its definitions of teacher and principal rely on credentials rather than functional roles. He argues the Act overly centralizes decision-making with the Minister when research shows students perform better when schools have autonomy, and observes that restrictions on student exemptions and inappropriate course counseling undermine student motivation and system credibility.</div>

<p>Editor,</p>
<p>Charlottetown Guardian</p>
<p>Charlottetown, PEI	</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Dear Sir:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><b>Education Act</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I read the new Education Act on the weekend; I urge others to do the same.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It sets s framework for school operation during the next few years; we are likely to see a more efficient operation but not necessarily a more effective one.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>First, the Act is misnamed; it is a schools act not an education act, and there is a difference.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>One must assume that the government believes that all education occurs in schools.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Hopefully some of the advisory councils will convince them otherwise.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The issue of education versus schooling should be settled early in the discussion<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The definitions are interesting; one would have expected an “Education Act” to define education,<span class="Apple-converted-space">            </span>s better definition of teacher than “a person who holds a teaching license” and principal “a teacher who…”; one might have expected “teacher and principal” to be defined ty the role they play rather than by the “folded paper” they carry.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>It is generally thought that schooling works best when teachers have the knowledge and autonomy to create appropriate learning experiences for children in their care.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In fact, the OECD, the initiator of PISA testing, found that students perform better when their schools have autonomy in everyday decision making including some autonomy for allocating funds; my own experience supports that view.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The Act, however, appears to reserve all decision-making for the Minister; good management practice delegates decision making much further down the line.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>While agreeing that teachers should encourage “students in their pursuit of learning”, I find it hard to square that with stories by students of sitting in class day in and day out while work they have already mastered is explained to others, students who at one time were eligible for “exemptions” but, in spite of Dean Goddard’s recommendation, no longer have that option, and young people being counselled into lower level courses rather than being provided the extra bit of help needed, as Finland has found possible.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Minor as these appeare, such simple steps would serve notice to students that the system does have their interests at heart.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>While the government of the day did not create current educational conditions, government is the only body with the wherewithal to correct them; we’re still waiting.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Don Glendenning</p>
<p><br></p>
