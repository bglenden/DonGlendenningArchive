  D-24 Why ask for high school  
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Glendenning confronts the credibility crisis of high school diplomas. He notes that employers require high school credentials, yet articles document rising graduation rates concurrent with falling basic skills, wide subject-matter gaps (6-8 years in some grades), and students in Grade 10 with Grade 6 mathematics levels. He acknowledges conventional arguments: teacher overwork, student homework resistance, test limitations, home environment factors, and social promotion principles. However, he argues it&#x27;s time to stop pretending. While maintaining diploma issuance if desired, institutions should also grant achievement-based qualifications documenting actual competence. He cites existing models—apprenticeship programs and International Baccalaureate—that successfully separate credentials from qualifications.</div>

<p>Editor,</p>

<p><br></p>
<p>Dear Sir:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><span>What does high school mean?</span></p>
<p><span></span><br></p>
<p>The ese of high school has come up several times in recent conversations; I checked a local on-line job bank and, sure enough, of the first 10 to jobs listed, seven required high school. Next the Christmas break, came a story from Charlotte, North Carolina about rising graduation rates but falling levels of basic skills.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Then there came a Christmas note from a friend about math skills then I recalled an article a few weeks ago in a New Zealand paper about student the range of math skills in most math classes. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And of course, there is the argument that supports “social promotion.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Then there’s the confusion of being in Grade 10 and having a grade 6 math level</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I understand the arguments tha teachers are overworked, students wont do homework, test results don’t tell the whole story, home conditions are not supportive of standards, students want to stay with their peers, etc. etc. etc.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>But it is time to stop pretending.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Continue to give a diploma, if we want, but also give a qualification-based document that<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>denotes actual achievement.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Such an arrangement now exists with apprenticeship and I am told with the IB program, in music and perhaps other subjects as well.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Don Glendenning</p>
<p>A long-time student of education</p>
