  D 25 Out of Sync
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">A comprehensive letter to Charlottetown Guardian and Journal Pioneer (Draft 25) analyzing PEI&#x27;s education system as &quot;out of sync.&quot; Don articulates his philosophy that education encompasses all formative experiences, not just schooling, and notes a major 21st-century shift where schools increasingly must handle social-emotional development as home structures weaken. He diagnoses structural problems (narrow role definition, fuzzy vision, coordination gaps, politicized leadership) and proposes solutions including professional service delivery models, learner-centered approaches, and separation of instruction from credentialing. References personal experience in multiple organizations and calls for clear vision statements developed with public input. This piece encapsulates many of his core education reform ideas.</div>

<p><b></b><br></p>

<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Education systems have been around for a long time; they focus on people helping to people to develop skills needed for later ife.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Initially the focus was on the transfer of information .<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Development, other than academics, was left to the home and community organizations. The 21</b><b><sup>st</sup></b><b> century has brought a major switch in roles.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Students have access to knowledge to the same extent as teachers but the home structure does not and cannot play the traditional development role. Increasingly, it seems, schools must play the lead role in social-emotional development. This etter focuses on education as an organization that delivers services to its citizens.</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Like many people of my vintage, I’ve been part of and played a variety of roles in many organizations; while each is unique, well- functioning organizations share many characteristics in common.</b></p>
<p><b>A narrow role</b></p>

<p><b>Narrowly defined roalwhereas most government department express their role in terms of “ encouraging and supporting the sector”, education has taken a much narrower view, that of delivering programs through schools.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That position reflects a both a narrow view of what constitutes education and support needed to make it better. I view the lack of a clear an publis vision one of the chief ostacles to improvement.</b></p>

<p><b>A focus on learners is both desirable and long overdue; one only has only to can education documents and listd to education dialogue to note the absence of concern about students, what they want and need and the extent to which they are being served.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Other professions seem to have dealt with the problem by assigning each client to a professional who both provides service directly and arranges for other services he/she cannot provide.</b></p>

<p><span><b>	</b></span>Preparation for life’s roles is called education and the better prepared we are the better we are able to cope with all that we encounter, or create.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Educating is a complex matter made so by the fact that each person is unique in many ways, unique in basic physical, mental, emotional make-up; unique in the range and nature of previous experience, unique in perceived futures, but also unique in terms of learning pace, style and needs.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Education is often described as any experience that has a formative effect on the way we think, feel or act; it may also be thought of as what we can do with what we have learned.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>It is widely recognized that education is a key factor in determining each citizen’s quality of life; in the same way, the collective education of our citizens will determine to a significant degree the quality of the communities in which we live.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In recognition of its importance, governments provide massive support for public education. The investment is justified for two reasons, one to ensure a high level of personal growth and development for every citizen; the other is to ensure the common good.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Based on media reports over the past few months, one can conclude that there is a gap between what Islanders have and what they want in the way of education. Literacy levels alone have come to the fore through PISA results, recent CFPEI survey of Island youth, presentation to the Standing Committee by the Charlottetown Area Chamber of Commerce,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>views expressed by the Summerside Chamber of Commerce, a 2014 survey by the PEI Home and School Federation and a series of workshops on Preparedness held throughout PEI by Education 20/20 Inc. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Indicators of the gap include: the limited engagement between educators and the community they serve; the lack of a philosophy of education that encompasses all our citizens; government’s focus on the young and schooling; service gaps such as the availability of part time instruction; politicization of decision making, and limits on professional autonomy and accountability. Citizens see most of the issues as organizational, created by government decision-makers and, therefore, capable of being changed by those same government decision-makers. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>In recent years, Prince Edward Island has instituted a number of initiatives to improve education including new and upgraded facilities, additional investment in technology, the East Prince trade and technology centre, embedded professional development (PD) days, but much more needs to be done.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is our view that the impact of these changes has been blunted by an outdated delivery organization and, in support of this view, we recommend that PEI:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Develop a “clear and compelling” vision of education for all Islanders.</b><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Although much has been written about education, a comprehensive vision statement does not currently exist for PEI. We believe that having such a statement is required, especially for a service as large and complex as education, however, we are not suggesting another study but rather a document prepared by a small working with opportunity for citizen input.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Develop a learner centered service model that provides support in all domains to learners as, when and where needed.</b><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Doing so would involve student centered outcomes, criterion referenced assessment, flexible scheduling, challenge for credit arrangements, and greater autonomy and accountability for teachers.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Assume a leadership role in creating a learning culture and providing a quality education for every Islander.</b><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Government should focus on matters of planning, setting priorities, funding, monitoring, and quality control, ensuring the availability of professional resources, home support for preschool children, information and continuing education.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Delegate the role of providing instruction.</b> The actual provision of instruction should be expanded beyond schools, colleges, universities to include community agencies, professionals in private practice and learners themselves.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Establish a qualification body for the purpose certifying individual levels of achievement to persons wanting or needing such documentation.</b><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The role of teachers is to help others learn; when teachers rank their students they are putting their ability to teach at risk. Assigning student grades, selecting students for prizes and awards and awarding diplomas and degrees is a sorting process and should not be part of a teacher’s role.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Apprenticeship with certification through a Provincial Department of Labour and music through the Royal Canadian Music Conservatory are examples of the recommended arrangement.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Establish a professional model of service delivery where professionals are directly accountable to clients for the nature, extent and quality of service provided.</b><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Such a model must include a direct and close professional-client relationship, the potential for a family education adviser for those who want it, and professional autonomy and accountability for all.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Put in place a strategy to encourage and support innovation, such a strategy to include freedom to experiment, an innovation fund and an external decision-making committee.</b></p>
<p><i></i><br></p>
<p><b>We are all on the road of life.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Learning is a process; it is a process of changing the way we feel, the way we think and the way we act. Only a learner can learn, which makes learning a very personal matter.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Learning comes naturally, we learn to satisfy our curiosity, our needs and drives and because it is personally rewarding.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Learners bring a number of conditions to each learning experience, conditions they were born with, things learned since birth and goals, expectations and perceived futures. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Family, friends and the community at large are interested and even demanding that we learn and invest substantial funds in support of an education systems.We aalso have teachers, people wih special training in how to elp oters learn. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Others help learners learn; they can do this through example, through providing instruction, through instruction and through creating situations where the learner learns on his or her own. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
