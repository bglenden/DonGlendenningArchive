<p>The main <b>goals</b> of mathematics education are to prepare students to (PEI Education Website MAT613A)</p>
<p><span> </span>use mathematics confidently to solve problems;</p>
<p><span> </span>communicate and reason mathematically;</p>
<p><span> </span>appreciate and value mathematics;</p>
<p><span> </span>make connections between mathematics and its applications;</p>
<p><span> </span>commit themselves to lifelong learning;</p>
<p><span> </span>become mathematically literate adults, using mathematics to contribute to society.</p>

<p>Provincial assessments are conducted yearly and tell us how well students are doing at key stages of learning. Students are assessed in reading, writing and mathematics at the end of Grade 3, Grade 6, and Grade 9. We also have an assessment called Early Years Evaluation (EYE) that takes place before a child goes into kindergarten.  <br>
<br>
These assessments are developed by teachers from across the province and are based on the curriculum used in Island schools. They tell us how well students are learning the curriculum, where students may need help, and how resources may be directed to improve our education system.<br>
<br>
Provincial assessments are just one of many tools used to monitor student learning. Parents should talk to the teacher about the full scope of their child’s performance. Working together with good information, parents and teachers can help students to reach their full potential.<br>
<br>
The Department of Education and Early Childhood Development also supports a national assessment which takes place every three years. The Pan-Canadian Assessment Program (PCAP) assesses the performance of Grade 8 students in reading, math and science.<br>
<br>
Every three years, Island students also take part in the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA), which assesses the achievement of 15-year-old students in reading, math and science through a common international test.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
