  7 Math levels 
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">An extensive position paper analyzing educational assessment and curriculum development in Canada, authored by Don Glendenning. The document critiques the current grade-level system, arguing that curriculum development lacks input from practitioners and that teaching and assessment should be separated functions. Don proposes establishing independent proficiency levels for mathematics based on field analysis, citing apprenticeship, music, and sports models as precedents. He advocates for age-independent, school-independent competency assessment with an independent certifying body. The proposal includes benefits (reduces bias, improves consistency, reduces teacher workload) and identifies potential models for implementation.</div>

<p><b>EDUCATION 20/20 INC.</b></p>
<p><b>Assessment Service-1</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Background</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>Our exploration of educational improvement in public education leads us quickly to the issue of curriculum development and the manner in which levels of achievement are established, measured and documented.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li4">Given that education is a provincial responsibility, curriculum development is carried out directly by Departments of Education although there is a high level of sharing and cooperation in curriculum development across the country.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In the public school domain, the Atlantic <span>Provinces share in the preparation of ubcurriculum; curriculum development in Western Canada is under the direction of the Western and Northern Canadian Protocol.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li4">Curriculum development starts with an identification of outcomes to be learned: they form the basis of detailed outlines, guides, references, lesson plans and other instructional support.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My search reveals that these outcomes are identified by curriculum consultants working with teachers. What’s missing is input from the people who are demonstrating the desired outcome in their day to day lives.</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li4">We must remember that education is a lifelong process; an<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>examination of how students learn show that they “spiral” through a subjrct all the time adding neww skills or performing existing ones at a higher level. To accommodate this need, an analysis of a field would seem to make sense first to let users know what’s, second to show what is needed to meet their objectives and to help future teachers their current levels.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My search for a comprehensive analysis included<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>CMEC, OECD, PISA and a number of provinces.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>No such master list was found. Curriculum developers, it seems, at least at the public school level, identifying outcomes or competencies for each age or grade level.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The delivery model includes little recognition that individuals learn at different rates and in any school grade, students in any subject will be well ahead or well behind the level being taught. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li4">One must also factor in summative evaluation that determines, at least for official purposes whether a student moves into the next grade or receives a graduation diploma.<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Summative assessment is the process of establishing your level of skill in a subject.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In competency terms, one person’s competency in a subject differ from another based on the range of competencies a level of performance on each.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As an example Farmer A I differs from Farmer B by the range of skills and the level of practice<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li4">The writer study of teaching and learning reveals that teaching and summative assessment are separate functions and that asking teachers to do both results in (1) standards vary from school to school, (2) fragmented, (3) open to bias, (4) leave results open to interpretation<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As examples of where the functions are separated (1) Apprenticeship (2) music, (3) sports generally and swimming in particular, by this I mean that the teaching function and the assignment of levels of accomplishment are separate authorities.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li4">Who should define levels?</li>
</ul>
<p>The establishment of levels of achievement/performance involves two stakeholders, first the user of the service and by this I include students, parents, employers, post-secondary institutions and the public at large.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Government</p>
<p><b>Conclusions:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p>The process of gaining an education could benefit from:</p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li4">Basing curriculum on competencies rather than outcomes</li>
  <li class="li4">Developing an independent analysis of each field of study</li>
  <li class="li4">Replacing Grades with recognizes levels determined from an examination of the field</li>
  <li class="li4">Establishing an independent body to evaluate students to determine their level within a field</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Proposal</b></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li4">To identify levels of proficiency in math</li>
  <li class="li4">establish an independent assessment service to certify a person’s level of math<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p>Three possibilities come quickly to mind: (government as it does for apprenticeship, (2) a private testing agency such as Pearson or, an NGO established for the purpose or a professional association such as the Canadian Mathematical Society</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Steps:</b></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li4">Prepare a math analysis</li>
  <li class="li4">Identify recognized levels</li>
  <li class="li4">Establish an independent assessment service</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Characteristics of Service</b></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li4">Independent of teaching institutions and employers</li>
  <li class="li4">Certify applicants level</li>
  <li class="li4">Independent of government</li>
  <li class="li4">Open to individuals of any age<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li4">By application<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li4">Qualification not a credential</li>
  <li class="li4">Results provided to person assessed and, on his request, to others</li>
  <li class="li4">Not limited to paper and pencil tests</li>
  <li class="li4">No age restriction</li>
  <li class="li4">Prior school attendance not required</li>
  <li class="li4">Competency based</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Benefits:</p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li4">Independent</li>
  <li class="li4">Removes bias</li>
  <li class="li4">Improves consistency</li>
  <li class="li4">Reduces teacher workload</li>
  <li class="li4">Provide schools with freedom to innovate</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p>Models:</p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li4">Apprenticeship,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li4">Swimming model</li>
  <li class="li4">Music at the Royal Canadian conservatory of music</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p>Assessment</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Formative assessment </b>is led by teachers as part of the ongoing give and take of the learning process conducted by teachers for<b> </b>the purpose of designing additional strategies for the purpose of helping a learner learn.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Criticism prepares a teacher to provide meaningful feedback and is.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Evaluation</b> is designed to establish a person’s level in a subject or field and should be criterion referenced</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Ranking</b> intended to show how one stacks up against others and results in students being winners or losers; although not part of the teaching function, students should be encouraged to participate in such activities with the results used by the learner and teacher to help a lea as part of the teaching learning process.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Schools could take a lesson from sports where coaches and referees are different people.</p>
