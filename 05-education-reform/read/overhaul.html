<div class="reader-summary">Letter to editor arguing for structural review of PEI&#x27;s education system, distinguishing between a &quot;school system&quot; (youth-focused) and an &quot;education system&quot; (lifelong learning). Don cites the World Bank&#x27;s warning about conflating schooling with education, and advocates for service-based organization addressing Islanders of all ages. Proposes that clarity on education purpose and service offerings is essential staff development and policy communication.</div>

<p><b>Dear Editor:</b></p>
<p><b>A System Review</b></p>
<p><b>Our education system needs a structural review; to be more precise; although we refer to our education system. it seems only to be a school system.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b>The World Bank, the largest financial contributor to public education, cautions countries about confusing going to school with getting an education. I believe we do that in PEI. We have a system focused on serving youth in school settings. What we should have is an education system focused on needs of Islanders of any age, interest and capability<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>whether in school, thinking about returning to school or simply needing<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>or wanting to learn more.</b></p>
<p><b>Based on my conversations, a restructuring is in order and should start with a clear understanding of education, a clear purpose and list of services offered. Preparing such a document, would be great in-service staff development; distributing such a document would add much needed clarity.respond to</b></p>
<p><b>Sincerely<br>
Don Glendenning</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>“Educating” is a service intended to help people gain or develop their knowledge, skills, attitudes, values and other attributes; typical services include information, counselling, learning products and technology, analysis, instruction, human resources and a tracking system.</b></p>
