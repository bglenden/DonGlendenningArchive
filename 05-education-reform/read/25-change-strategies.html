<p><b>EDUCATION FIRST CANADA</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Strategies for Change</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Goal: A</b> quality education for every Canadian through:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>1<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Providing relevant information</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>Information is the fuel of change; without Information, the change process is likely soon</p>
<p>to sputter and fail.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But having information by itself, is not a guarantee of change.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The</p>
<p>public needs recent, consistent, readily available information about education, especially</p>
<p>about innovation and best practices. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>2<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Engaging the Community<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b> <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Public engagement refers to the interaction of specialists with the public in the decision making process.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Typically, specialists consult, that is, they arrange opportunities for the public to make its views known about a matter under development. But people want more than simply being consulted, they want to engage in the setting of policies and the making of decision.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Public engagement results in putting more decision-making powers directly into the hands of ordinary people – it is grass roots democracy in action.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Public engagement starts with the setting of the agenda, working from shared information, a transparent agenda, and ensuring inclusiveness, control and transparency. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>4 Encouraging and supporting innovation</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>Our world is constantly and rapidly changing.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Organizations must adapt and even reinvent themselves otherwise they are likely to become irrelevant and even disappear; education is no exception.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The education system must not only accept change but embrace it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A learning environment that demonstrates change helps learners prepare for a future that involves change.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>One size fits all is no longer good enough.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Professional educators must be given the freedom to innovate, even the freedom sometimes to fail, and encouraged even recognized for doing it.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>5<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Recognizing leadership of people, organizations and institutions<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p>Often innovators go unnoticed; we hope to change that.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We propose to recognize and reward institutions and organizations, as well as individuals for their efforts in improving the quality of education for every Canadian</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>6<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Encouraging and supporting research</b></p>
<p>There is always a need for research into alternative and better ways to teach, administer, manage and organize.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>9<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Developing an organizational capacity to provide service</b></p>
<p>There is a need, and one that will increase as we grow into the task, to develop a supporting education.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
