<div class="reader-summary">Notes on the PEI Education Act (duplicate variant) providing Glendenning&#x27;s critical analysis for the Green Party. He identifies the Act&#x27;s limitations: narrow school-focused scope, excessive ministerial centralization, lack of provisions for adult/lifelong learning, and insufficient educator professional autonomy—reflecting his broader vision for comprehensive, inclusive, and professionally-driven education systems.</div>

<p><b>Notes on PEI Education Act</b></p>
<p><b>As requested by the Green Party</b></p>
<p><b>April 28, 2016</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>1 Opening comments:</b></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li3"><b>Education is the most important issue of the day</b></li>
  <li class="li3"><b>What we do/become, what this Island becomes will be determined to a large degree, by the education that we provide</b></li>
  <li class="li3"><b>Education – any experience that has a formative effect on the way a person thinks, feels or acts</b></li>
  <li class="li3"><b>Schooling – instruction, education or training received in a school</b></li>
  <li class="li3"><b>The OECD points out the students fare better on PISA exams where the school has autonomy in its day to day operations</b></li>
  <li class="li3"><b>It is my firm belief that the role of Government is to plan, lead, fund, ensure quality and inform but not to directly deliver programs.</b></li>
</ul>
<p><b>2 Having said that, however, here are some general comments about the proposed Act</b></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li3"><b>Education needs to allow professionals freedom to act and accountability for their action , similar to the freedom of doctors and lawyers; at the moment teachers are the equivalent of nurses in a hospital but subject<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>to directions from politicians not<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>professionals educators</b></li>
  <li class="li3"><b>I know that it is an Act and, therefore, must be precise but it but all decisions appear to fall to the Minister.</b></li>
  <li class="li3"><b>The Act reeks of efficiency more so than effectiveness.</b></li>
</ul>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>3 Focuses:</b></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li3"><b>Narrow vision of education – what one learns in school</b></li>
  <li class="li3"><b>More appropriate to call it a PEI Schools Act</b></li>
  <li class="li3"><b>Appears focused on knowledge acquisition and credits</b></li>
  <li class="li3"><b>No mention of education for adults, part time learners, independent learners, the employed, adult educational upgrading, education for personal development; in spite of the name, the Act is about schooling and not education.</b></li>
  <li class="li3"><b>Strange that an Education Act does not define” education”</b></li>
  <li class="li3"><b>It appears that all decisions will be made by government employees</b></li>
  <li class="li3"><b>Some public advisors but no public decision makers</b></li>
  <li class="li3"><b>Don’t have any sense of trying to improve effectiveness</b></li>
</ul>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>4 When Government operates schools:</b></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li3"><b>Fairness goes out the window</b></li>
  <li class="li3"><b>The system becomes politicized</b></li>
  <li class="li3"><b>Non-operational matters, leadership, quality, standards, monitoring, public information, accountability and standards suffer</b></li>
  <li class="li3"><b> Little room for debate</b></li>
  <li class="li3"><b>The kind of education made available and the kind of education government pays for becomes one and the same</b></li>
</ul>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>5 From my reading of the Act:</b></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li3"><b>If the new organization will provide a better education than the former system, why are French students excluded?</b></li>
  <li class="li3"><b>“Education” should be defined</b></li>
  <li class="li3"><b>“Education program” (1-ff) should be defined also</b></li>
  <li class="li3"><b>I’m glad to see a description of the principal’s role, I believe that is new.</b></li>
</ul>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>NOTES:</b></p>
