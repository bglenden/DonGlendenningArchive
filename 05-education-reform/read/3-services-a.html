  3 Services A
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Don frames education as services rather than levels or specialties. He catalogs seven education services: Information (relevant to education decisions), Governance and Leadership (vision and monitoring), Instruction (diagnosis, counselling, presentations, assessment), Quality Assurance (community standards), Learning products and technology, Funding (equitable), and Human Resources (teachers, administrators, counsellors). This brief piece establishes the framework that education departments should organize around service delivery rather than client categories, noting he adapted this list from the National Business Council.</div>

<p><b>Education Services</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>People describe education in many ways; most seem to think of education in terms of levels or specialties. The writer, on the other hand, thinks of education in terms of helpor services ffered:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

  <li class="li1">Governance and Leadership - in the form of a body and organization with vision and responsibility to put in place and monitor educational services for the benefit of its citizens,</li>
  <li class="li1">Instruction - direct help in the form of diagnosis, counselling, presentations, practice, assessment and access generally to learning resources<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li1">Quality Assurance - a system that assures the community that their learning experiences meet community standards.</li>
