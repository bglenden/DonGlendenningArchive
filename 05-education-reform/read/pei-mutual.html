<div class="reader-summary">A compelling fundraising letter dated May 5, 2013, to PEI Mutual seeking financial support for Education 20/20 Inc. Don articulates his educational philosophy: education is &quot;the most important issue of the day&quot; and will determine individual and collective futures. He identifies systemic weaknesses including lack of autonomy, accountability, and mismatch between taught and needed skills. The letter describes Education 20/20&#x27;s activities (workshops, publications, website development, school awards) and emphasizes that the public must demand change since traditional reform efforts have failed. Don notes the organization is federally incorporated and seeking charitable status, with administrative support from the Community Foundation of PEI. He requests $25,000 in total support and invites a meeting to discuss solutions.</div>

<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Education is
important, in fact, it is the most important issue of the day and our
quality of education will be a major determinant of our individual
and collective futures.  Changes are needed, and there is wide
support for change both inside and outside the system, but <span lang="en-US">changes
fall short of what is actually required and fail to deal with a
number of underlying weaknesses such as autonomy, accountability and
the mismatch between skills taught and skills needed.  It is also my
view that </span>the required changes are not likely to happen unless
the public, you and I, demand it. Traditional efforts to bring about
change have not worked.  Some innovative, perhaps even bold, measures
are required, but we think that a better education system is worth
it.

the past few months, I’ve been working with a small group of
Islanders who are of the same mind and are willing to devote time and
energy to the change process.  Under the name, </span><b>Education
20/20 Inc.</b> we’ve organized
workshops, published a and carried on discussions about the low
reading levels among adult Islanders.  A committee has been put in
place to organize workshops in a number of Island communities,
finishing touches are being put on a website, plans are proceeding to
for a school award,  additional Directors have been added and we’ve
been investigating the matter of low reading levels. The attached
invitation to a workshop on May 14 on “on-line course delivery”
may also be of interest.
