<p>develop a sense of self-worth;</p>
<p>develop a respect for community values, a</p>

<p>human rights and an appreciation for the</p>
<p>worth of all individuals.</p>
<p>Although the family and the community have</p>
<p>important roles to play in public education, the</p>
<p>school’s curriculum is of prime importance in</p>
<p>addressing the goals.</p>
<p>Curriculum guides clearly articulate what</p>
<p>students are expected to know and be able to</p>
<p>do. Delivery of curriculum must reflect these</p>
<p>expectations, and there must be an accurate</p>
<p>assessment of students’ performance in relation</p>
