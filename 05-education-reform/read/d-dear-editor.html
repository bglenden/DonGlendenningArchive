  D Dear Editor
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Written by Don. Letter to editor proposing PEI create comprehensive &quot;education system&quot; (services for all Islanders, not just school-age students). Argues current &quot;school system&quot; insufficient; proposes advisory model (education advisor like family doctor), learning context establishment, competency-based progress reporting. Addresses life roles (individual, family member, learner, citizen, consumer, producer). Encapsulates Don&#x27;s core educational vision for systemic reform beyond traditional schooling.</div>

<p><b>Dear Editor:</b></p>
<p><b>An education system</b></p>
<p><b>Prince Edward Island needs an education system - a system of services available to<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>all Islanders not just for Islanders who want or are able to go to school. We’d probably be the first in Canada but I believe that such a system would be an ideal way to structure education services to meet the changing interests and needs of both Islanders and the Island community. The world is changing and education must do likewise; otherwise, we all get left behind. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In order for an education system to work, we need a clear vision as to what people will need to know and be able to do 20, 40,60 years down the road.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Today, people fill a number of life roles that of an individual, family member, learner, citizen, consumer and producer roles.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Those roles will likely be there tomorrow but also fifty years from now but may not be quite the same.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b>School is a common term to describe assistance to learners. I argue that is not <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>sufficient detail for today let alone tomorrow. They need to be broken out and would likely include information, counselling, diagnosis, instruction, tutoring and technology. Services need to be separately to individual learners consistent with their stage of development<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>So how would an <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>education system differ from the school system we now have?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li1"><b>Students would enrol in the system and select<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>or be provided with an educational advisor</b></li>
  <li class="li1"><b>Advisor <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>would deliver some services or arrange for them to be delivered<span class="Apple-converted-space">              </span>by another (much kike a family doctor}</b></li>
  <li class="li1"><b>Learning context would be established and learning profile modifed as needed.</b></li>
  <li class="li1"><b>Learning progress would be reported on a competency by competency basis</b></li>
</ul>
