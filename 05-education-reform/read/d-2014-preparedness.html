  D 2014 Preparedness
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Don addresses reported gaps in student preparation for employment and further education, referencing the Conference Board of Canada&#x27;s framework of employability skills: fundamental skills (communication, information management, numeracy, problem-solving), personal management (attitude, responsibility, adaptability, safety), and teamwork. He argues these skills are primarily developmental and experiential rather than content-based, making school classrooms poorly suited for their acquisition. Don proposes community-based pilot projects with local leadership involvement, positioning community as the classroom and transforming skill development into participatory experience rather than classroom instruction.</div>

<p>Dear Sir:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Student preparedness<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></b></p>
<p>Young people report gaps in their preparation for the work force and further education; members of the public agree.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Examples that are given in support of the view usually involve skills needed in every day living.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I think<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>that the best description of the missing skills is provided by the Conference Board of Canada.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></p>
<p>The Conference Board has identified three clusters employability skills: (1) fundamental skills of communication, managing information, using numbers and solving problems, (2) personal management skills of demonstrating a positive attitude, responsibility, adaptability, working safely and being a lifelong learner, and (3) teamwork skills of working with others and participating in projects and tasks. While labelled employability skills, I believ that they are broader than that and view them as the skills needed for ever day living.</p>
<p>Can these skills be learned?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Absolutely.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Should these skills be learned by young people? Again, absolutely and learned by all people of all ages.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Are they a legitimate part of our educational system?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Again, absolutely.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Can they be learned in school? Maybe; probably not. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I say this for<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>a couple of reasons.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Schools are organized to deliver content and, in fact, are measure on how well they do it.Employability skills are largely developmental or experiential; they are processes to be developed and cannot be packaged into 50 minute periods.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They don’t fit well into a school environment. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The improvement of personal skills, I suggest, could be well served from a community based setting with the community<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>as the classroom, content identified by community leaders and local schools as partners.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It would be a winning combination.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Yes, it would require a modest investment but the return to the community would be substantial.</p>
<p>I suggest a pilot project, running in a couple of communities, under local control.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Based on the recent workshops conducted throughout the Island by Education 20/20, I am certain<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>a number of communities would be interested and leaders would come forward<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Don Glendenning</p>
