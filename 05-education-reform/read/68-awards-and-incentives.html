<p><b>Awards</b></p>
<p><b>July 5, 2014</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>An Awards Programs for PEI Schools</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>BACKGROUND</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>Education, as compared to other sectors, lacks appropriate economic incentives for either the student, teacher or institution for the provider to shorten the period required to reach the current level or to reach a higher level in a shorter period of time.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is not surprising, therefore, that there is increasing support for the view that incentives and awards have a place in improving student results.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There are two common approaches:</p>
<p><br></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li5">Outcomes based incentives focuses on student achievement; this approach, however, is both highly publicized and highly controversial, and has been found to distort the system, and benefits, if any, are found to be minimal.</li>
  <li class="li5">Process based incentives, on the other hand, focus on practices and processes of gaining or providing educational experiences. The literature supports an incentives based approach although the writer found little directly related to awards that simply recognized achievement</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p>Given the above, Education 20/20 proposes and award program that focused on:</p>
<p>supports incentive and award programs with the following restrictions: proposes to institute an awards program as a mechanism to call attention to important characteristics of a quality education, characteristics of effective schools, and<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>to make that information public and as a mechanism to provide support to schools for teir efforts.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Readers should be aware that, while Education 20/20 supports incentive programs for both individuals and institutions, it beleves that selecting winners is not<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>a teaching function and, therefore they should not be part of the awarding process.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The fact that education 20/20 is an independedn organization allows it to play the role</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Schools are established to help people learn; the giving of awards is a sorting process.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Issue as to whether an institution should do both.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Does asking teachers to select winners constitute a conflict of interest?There is a question not an educational process, and there ia sThere is also some conmcern, however, about the practice of schools, whose role is to teach, also givimh awards<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Awards<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>should be made by an external body</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Purposes:</b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The over-all purpose of an awards program is to improve education through:</p>

<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li5">Fairfax County elementary school’s PTA has won a national 2012 parent engagement award for its programs that involve families of many different backgrounds and that provide services for different segments of the community.</li>
  <li class="li5">Research has repeatedly found that students do better in school when their families are engaged in the life of the school. Programs that involve parents in student achievement, such as family nights on math or literacy and family workshops on planning for college, are thought to be especially helpful.</li>
  <li class="li5">Mantua Elementary School, with about 900 students from pre-kindergarten through sixth grade, was cited by the National PTA for its human relations committee, which provides translators for publications that keep families informed about the school, as well as for a mentorship program, service projects for the elderly and needy families, and extracurricular activities for students. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li5">PTAs that won merit awards were from the 23rd District School in Riverside, California; James G. Blaine Elementary in Chicago; Herberich Primary School in Copley-Fairlawn, Ohio; and Cache Elementary South in North Logan, Utah. The awards recognize those PTAs across the country that have implemented the organization’s national standards for family-school partnerships. Here are the PTA’s National Standards for Family-School Partnerships:</li>
  <ul class="ul1">
    <li class="li5">Standard 1: Welcoming all families into the school community—Families are active participants in the life of the school, and feel welcomed, valued, and connected to each other, to school staff, and to what students are learning and doing in class.</li>
    <li class="li5">Standard 2: Communicating effectively—Families and school staff engage in regular, two-way, meaningful communication about student learning.</li>
    <li class="li5">Standard 3: Supporting student success—Families and school staff continuously collaborate to support students’ learning and healthy development both at home and at school, and have regular opportunities to strengthen their knowledge and skills to do so effectively.</li>
    <li class="li5">Standard 4: Speaking up for every child—Families are empowered to be advocates for their own and other children, to ensure that students are treated fairly and have access to learning opportunities that will support their success.</li>
    <li class="li5">Standard 5: Sharing power—Families and school staff are equal partners in decisions that affect children and families and together inform, influence, and create policies, practices, and programs.</li>
    <li class="li5">Standard 6: Collaborating with community—Families and school staff collaborate with community members to connect students, families, and staff to expanded learning opportunities, community services, and civic participation.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
