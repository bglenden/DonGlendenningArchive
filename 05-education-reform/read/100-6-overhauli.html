  100 -6 OverhaulI
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Draft letter distinguishing education as service (developing skills, knowledge, attitudes for thriving) versus product (MOOCs, courses, diplomas). Notes institutions focus on product delivery while service remains under-served despite community initiatives (community schools, seniors&#x27; colleges, night classes). Proposes education service centers as &quot;pharmacy&quot; model offering advice and products, training/upgrading centers, or referral points—potentially separate from institutions given traditional institutions&#x27; poor continuing education records. Discusses need for learning-centered materials, experienced teachers, student records, and service management systems, suggesting Souris as potential pilot location.</div>

<p><b>Education: Product or Service</b></p>
<p><b>Customized learning</b></p>
<p>Education can be viewed as a service or a product; institutions provid boyh, it seems, focus on products; service is under-served and an area for growth. Community schools, Seniors’ College, night classes and continuing education all<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>address the need but unserviced areas remain and the need is likely to grow.</p>
<p>Education can be viewed as a service (skills, knowledge, attitudes and attributes to thrive in the years ahead) as a developer and provider of products (MOOC’s, courses, programs, diplomas and degrees).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Most institutions, it seems, focus on products; service is under-served and an area for growth. Community schools, Seniors’ College, night classes and continuing education all<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>address the need but unserviced areas remain and the need is likely to grow.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The need<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>for education is being fed changes in the world around us – technology, changing nature of work, people changing jobs and the gig economy; both people and the community help. Demand for education services is on the increase in the form of information, counselling, learning products, instruction and support.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Obviously, institutions could, and do, do both but more is needed and the need is likely to grow. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Education service could be providde in a number of ways:</p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li1">Integrating to existing program offerings</li>
  <li class="li1">Through extended days and years</li>
  <li class="li1">Creating new organizations such as Seniors’ College and Community Schools but with a much broader mandate.</li>
</ul>
<p>One can visualize a variety of configurations depending on the nature of the community:</p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li1">Essential skills<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li1">Soft skills<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li1">Technologyeducation service centresWhat would an education service centre look like?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It could be likened to a pharmacy stocked with education products and someone who can advise on them; it may also be like a training centre where a person checks in for up-dating or up-grading, or a place to which a person may be referred, or maintain contact via IT. An education service would draw heavily on institutions but would likely not be institution based.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>On the surface, combining both in the same institution makes<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>sense but, given the record of most institutions with continuing education services, it’s likely that separate institutions will be needed.</li>
</ul>
<p>My search suggests that success as a service institution will depend in a large measure upon availability of learning centered support materials, experience of teachers, student records. Service management systems, ? ? ? Souris would be a great place yo start.b<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></p>

<p>Obviously, we need schools; they are the hubs of our communities; they are more than just places to learn math, literacy and Shakespeare.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Their contributions include socialization and transferring the culture; they provide a “whole” experience at a critical time in one’s life.</p>
