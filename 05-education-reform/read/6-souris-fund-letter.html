<p>Dear Ms. Jackson:</p>
<p>Supporting Innovation in Souris</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>First let me commend you for your “UPSE Has a Heart” initiative, I never really doubted it but it is great to see it reaffirmed.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Education 20/20 Inc.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>is an independent, broad based not-for-profit education group that was incorporated in 2012 and received a charitable number in 2015 (80082 7081 RR0001) It is headquartered in Charlottetown and is governed by a volunteer board. Activities include an annual education award, a monthly bilingual newsletter, workshops and public presentations, research and occasional papers and a variety of low-key consultations with various individuals and organizations.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>More detailed information may be found in the enclosed literature.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>As you are no doubt aware, for a number of years Education 20/20 Inc. has offered an award to recognize a school or educational organization for good work during the previous year.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Although we are pleased with the experience to date, we believe that there are many teachers and others have ideas of their own that we could support.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We propose to seek out a person, school or organization in the Souris area with an innovative idea. To work with them if needed to shape the idea and to offer encouragement and funds to bring it to fruition.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>This letter is an invitation to the Union of Public Sector Employees to be the lead donor with a $1,500 grant to fund an innovative educational initiative in Souris; in return, Education 20/20 will raise a matching amount.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>With funds in hand, Education will then call for proposals as per the attached description.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Should our fundraising exceed the matching amount, we will apply the surplus to a similar initiative in 2019.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Education 20/20 will not claim your contribution until we have a matching amount in our account.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>By joining forces, we can double the likelihood that innovation will find take in Souris</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>We thank you in advance for your consideration and, should this application be successful, will give appropriate public recognition to the Union of Public Service Employees for your role in making it happen.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
<p><br></p>
