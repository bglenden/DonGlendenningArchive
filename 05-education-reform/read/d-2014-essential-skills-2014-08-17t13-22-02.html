<div class="reader-summary">A major Guardian letter proposing replacement of the traditional degree/diploma system with a stage-based certification model similar to music and swimming, where independent testing services verify achievement levels. Don argues this would improve consistency, reduce teacher workload, enhance fairness, and provide employers with meaningful skill verification rather than age-based credentials.</div>

<p>Dear Sir:</p>
<p><b>Switch to essential skills<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The community, not just employers, needs citizens who can, read, write calculate and perform other basic and essential skills.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Many, perhaps most, high school graduates have those skills, but some do not.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>How does an employer tell them apart?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That has become an issue.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Degrees and diplomas provide information about what was studied and for how long, and may even include ranking compared to classmates, but tells little about what was learned, how well, and what one can do with what one knows.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The latter is of considerable interest to employers. While the current system could be improved, I believe that the current system should be replaced with a “stage-based” system, not unlike that now in place for music, swimming and other fields. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Such a system would involve:</p>
<p>Identifying levels or stages of performance in a subject, and</p>
<p>Establishing a separate assessment service</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>For mathematics, for example, it would work something like this:</p>
<p>First we clearly identify stages – probably a half dozen or so</p>
<p>Next we find or design a system that measures an individual’s performance to determine his or her level</p>
<p>Then we set up an external testing service</p>
<p>Employers and postsecondary institutions would identify the level or levels they want.</p>
<p>A student wanting/needing a certification of their level in one or more subjects would take the test and be given the results.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Based on results, students make plans as to next steps.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Separating teaching from certification is the norm in most sectors; adopting it in education would, I suggest, improve consistency, allow teachers to focus teaching and formative assessment, dramatically lighten teacher work load, be fairer to students and<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>remove the conflict of teachers ranking<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>the students they teach; readers will, I am sure, be able to add other advantages to this list.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Let me know your stage of thinking at<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>HYPERLINK "mailto:standards2020@gmail.com" <span>standards2020@gmail.com</span>.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
<p>Don Glendenning</p>
<p>A long-time student of education</p>
