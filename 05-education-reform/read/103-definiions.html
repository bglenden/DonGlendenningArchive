<div class="reader-summary">Letter critiquing PEI&#x27;s imprecise educational terminology. Don argues that using &quot;Education and Lifelong Learning&quot; conflates education with schooling, similar to saying &quot;Department of Agriculture and Farming.&quot; He presents his working definition of education as all experiences with formative effect on thinking, feeling, or acting. References Good&#x27;s Dictionary of Education and criticizes educators for interchangeably using &quot;education&quot; and &quot;schooling.&quot;</div>

<p>Dear Editor:</p>
<p>Education on PEI is plagued by an inability or unwillingness to define terms. While I support the recent move to bring lifelong learning into the education envelope; the linking implies that lifelong learning doesn’t really belong.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The same can be said<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>f or Education and Early Childhood Development used by the former Government or and Education and Training used in Manitoba.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>An equivalent would be to establish a Department of Agriculture and Farming, a Department of Transportation and Airports or a <b>Department of Transportation and Ferries.</b></p>
<p><b>My search shows education to be an umbrella term, one that applies to the acquisition or further development of attitudes, skills, knowledge and values of people of all ages,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>all fields of endeavour, all levels of performance and on a full or part time basis in any field of endeavor.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My own working efinition is simply that my education includes all the experiences that had a formative effect on the way I think, feel or act.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In spite of this, educators continue to use education and schooling interchangeably,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I’ ve been asked where I got my education when the asker really wanted to know where I went to school. Documments about education frequently are only about schools.</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>

<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>eople who lead the education<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>system tend to promote an institution based model of cognitive services leading to traditional academic qualifications.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>We’ve become careless in<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>the way we describe education; while the finger can be point at all of us, some of the most egregious examples are those practiced<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>by provincial governments, the very bodies given constitutional authority to encourage, support<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>and regulate education services throughout the country.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This sloppiness, I suggest, has an identifiable negative impact on<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>the quality of educational services delivered to our citizens.</b></p>
<p><b>You are telling people that prep for ork is not importsnt</b></p>

<p><b>Divide Dept on functions not on perveived respctabilityConcerned about transition, then put transition in the title</b></p>
<p><b>Adding Lifelong learning, ece, training implies that they are not, in themselves part of the wduc</b></p>

<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>A Department of Education may have a number of divisions such as Early Childhood and Continuing Education.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Over the years my guide to terminology of education was Good’s “Dictionary of Education” It provides two definitions:</p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li3">The aggregate of all the processes<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>by means of which a person develop abilities, attitudes and other forms of behaviour of positive value in he society inm which he lives</li>
  <li class="li3"><b>T</b>he social process by which people are subjected to the influence of a selected and controlled environment sot that they may attain social competence and optimum individual development</li>
</ul>

<p>Sincerely</p>
