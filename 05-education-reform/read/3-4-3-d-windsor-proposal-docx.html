</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Further refined Windsor Foundation proposal addressing the &quot;Preparedness Initiative.&quot; Frames the core educational problem: low level of basic skills in high school graduates impacting transition to employment and postsecondary studies. Cites PISA results, 2013 CFPEI youth survey, chamber of commerce presentations, and Education 20/20 workshops across PEI. Criticizes the silo nature of schooling, curriculum misalignment, and inflexibility. Proposes solutions including establishing steering committees, searching relevant literature, conducting DACUM-based competency analysis, developing Bloom&#x27;s-taxonomy-aligned rating scales, identifying profiles reflecting citizenship, work entry, and postsecondary gaps, benchmarking, testing the model, and reporting. Describes features such as common curriculum maps for teachers and learners, multiple profiles from single analysis, engaging broad stakeholder participation, and fostering collaborative education teams. Appendix A includes detailed background on CFPEI&#x27;s &quot;Preparedness gaps&quot; finding from Island youth survey.

of organization</b></span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Education
20/20 Inc. is federally incorporated as an independent, broad based,
national, not-for-profit education organization, located in
Charlottetown, PEI and is governed
by a volunteer Board of Directors.  Our <span lang="en-US">vision
is a </span>quality education
for every Canadian and mission is to <span lang="en-US">support
and strengthen a culture of learning for all Canadians; Education
20/20 Inc. is unique among educational organizations in Canada in
that it is unaligned with any educational institutions, grade level,
subject field or cause.   The organization operates with ten
Directors, a network of some fifty people, and a mailing list of
about 250; an application for charitable status has been filed with
Canada Revenue Agency; in the meantime, The Community Foundation of
Prince Edward Island accepts donations and pays invoices on our
behalf. Attached please find a list of activities carried out to
date, activities planned for the coming year.   Although most
Directors have participated in externally funded projects in their
other roles, this is the first such project for Education 20/20 Inc.
and certainly our first request for funding to the Windsor
Foundation.</span></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><span lang="en-US"><b>Proposal
</b></span>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">Engage
stakeholders in narrowing the gap that young Islanders are
experiencing on the way to further study and employment. The attached
“one-pager” describes how we arrived at this decision.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><span lang="en-US"><b>Issue
being addressed</b></span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"> <span lang="en-US">The
proposal addresses one of the major issues of the day in education,
namely the low level of basic education skills demonstrated by young
people, including high school graduates.  As evidence I refer to </span><span lang="en-US">PISA
test results for Prince Edward Island; a 2013 survey of issues of
Island youth conducted by the Community Foundation; a presentation to
a Standing Committee of the PEI Legislative Assembly by the
Charlottetown Area chamber of Commerce; How Canada Performs, a
Provincial and Territorial Ranking, Education and Training; Education
and Skills, and a series of workshops on Preparedness held throughout
PEI by Education 20/20 Inc.  The PEI Department of Education has not
taken exception to the findings nor, to the best of our knowledge,
assumed a leadership role that includes corrective action.  Based on
our consultations, a pilot in the area of math has the most likely
chance of success.</span></p>
<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><span lang="en-US">The proposed
approach responds in particular to the nature of the education
enterprise:</span></p>
<ul>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><span lang="en-US"><b>Silo nature
	of schooling:</b></span><span lang="en-US">  The nature of the
	education enterprise reinforces silo practices, time based
	instructional segments, age based grouping, Institutional
	boundRAiessingle teacher led classrooms, lack of user input into
	curriculum development, and isolated professional developmentmost
	readily identifiable educational silos on PEI include the public
	school system, the university, colleges(2), literacy training,
	continuing education, and the many “NGO” education and training
	projects.  We find little evidence of coordination in curriculum
	development, professional development activities, joint projects,
	etc.  Nobody, it seems, except the Premier has the authority or
	responsibility to deal with the issue in an integrated way.</span></p></li>
</ul>
<p lang="en-US" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in"><br />

</p>
<ul>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><span lang="en-US"><b>Need for
	curriculum alignment:</b></span><span lang="en-US">  The second
	problem is pedagogical and includes curriculum development,
	assessment, inability or unwillingness to adjust time; we know that
	students have different interests, different capabilities, prior
	experiences and learn at different paces yet the education refuses
	tro adjust one og iits major tools/resources, that of time.  It
	would seem so simple to peovide a </span>

</ul>
<p lang="en-US" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in"><br />

</p>
<ul>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><span lang="en-US"><b>System
	inflexibility</b></span><span lang="en-US">:  Education is a very
	personal and individual developmental experience school instruction,
	on the other hand, is a product delivery system with the product
	development by one professional and  the application by another. 
	There is little inclinatrion or opportunity for customizing at the
	point where student and teacher meet.  Thhe literature , leaders and
	the community call for change but, at least to date, tere is little
	evidence that the call is being heard. </span>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><span lang="en-US"><b>Relationship to
Foundation Priorities</b></span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><span lang="en-US">The Windsor
Foundation has two major areas of interest</span></p>
<ul>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><span lang="en-US"><b>Disadvantaged
	or vulnerable youth</b></span><span lang="en-US">: These are tough
	times for young people in transition from public school to further
	education and to work.  While there are many causes, this proposal
	addresses the issue of basic skills, those skills needed to gain
	entry to the next phase of life and,  without which many are branded
	as failures.  We are aware that sometimes this may from poor
	decisions by  students  themselves; on the other hand, we are also
	aware that the gap may from incorrect information, biased
	counselling, streaming, out dated course content, poor teaching,
	inflexible scheduling, lack of encouragement and mentoring, and the
	list goes on. </span>
	</p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><span lang="en-US"><b>Higher
	education initiatives:</b></span><span lang="en-US"> Although not as
	well  documented, we’ve also been made aware  of the many young
	people now in college and university who struggle with their studies
	because of low level of basic skills; the writer actually visited
	make-up classes as part of the information gathering
	process.Although we do not have the actual figures, we know that the
	duplication of services is a strain on taxpayer’s dollars.</span></p></li>
</ul>
<p lang="en-US" align="center" style="margin-left: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0in">
<br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><span lang="en-US">Our proposal has
several innovative features including (1) creating a common map to be
used by learners and teachers alike so that students and teachers
alike have the same view of the process, (2) a single analysis with
multiple profiles instead of the disjointed approach of creating a
map for each school grade, (3) engaging s broad range of users and
providers in the curriculum development processand (4)reducing the
“silo” effect of teachers working at difference levels may see
themselves as a team.   </span>

<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">In
late 2013, The Community Foundation of Prince Edward Island (CFPEI)
undertook a survey of over 200 Island youth to identify issues that
directly affect them; the report, T<u>aking
the Pulse of Island Youth</u>,
available on the Foundation<span lang="en-US">’s</span>
website at <u><a href="http://www.cfpei.ca/">www.cfpei.ca</a>,</u>
provides a snapshot of the findings.  Bright
spots include a positive sense of community, emerging entrepreneurial
spirit, volunteerism and new postsecondary offerings. The main
concerns include a lack of jobs, surviving on low-paying jobs,
educational deficiencies and drug and alcohol addictions.  On the
subject of education and learning, the study reports a high rate of
completion of high school and postsecondary education, a high level
of inclusivity and relatively affordable tuition costs; young people
also  expressed concerns about their readiness for the next stage of
life including:

<p align="justify" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Following
the publication of the CFPEI Report, Education 20/20 organized five
public discussions for the purpose of informing the community of the
report and its findings, learning more about youth issues in our
communities, exploring issues of education and learning, and to
identify actions to be taken to close gaps.  Discussions were lively
and wide ranging, and carried on well after the formal session ended.
  The final report included a number of conclusions and
recommendations of which the recommendation below triggered this
proposal.
