<p><b>Strategic Plan <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b><b></b></p>
<p><b>Education 20/20 Inc.</b> is a broad based, national, not-for-profit education organization, located in Charlottetown, PEI and is governed by a volunteer Board of Directors; people who have demonstrated an interest in and knowledge of education but are not representative of any educational constituency.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Vision:<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span></b>A national not-for-profit organization that encourages and supports a quality education for every Canadian.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Mission: </b>To improve the quality of education by providing a vehicle to support and strengthen a culture of learning for all Canadians.</p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Mandate: </b>To influence the evolution of our education system by providing information, encouragement and support for learner-centered education for all.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Beliefs about education</b>:</p>
<p>Education is intended to help people function better in their various life roles</p>
<p>Education includes social-emotional growth as well as academic studies</p>
<p>The future of our community will be shaped in a large measure by the education we<span class="Apple-converted-space">        </span>make available to our citizens</p>
<p>Education is much broader than schooling; the two should not be confused</p>
<p>Education is a lifelong journey; support for education requires a similar perspective</p>
<p>Educating is a community endeavour</p>
<p>The primary role of the teacher is to facilitate learning.</p>
<p>A culture of learning promotes a quality education.</p>
<p>One’s education results from many meaningful learning experiences.</p>
<p>EDUCATION AT ITS BEST INSPIRES A LOVE OF LEARNING</p>
<p>DON:<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I AGREE WITH STATEMENT; IS “LOVE OF LEARNING AN OUTCOME?; IF SO, SHOULD WE INCLUDE OTHER OUTCOMES?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><span><b>AS THIS IS A BELIEF, I DON’T THINK WE NEED OUTCOMES. ECM</b><b></b></span></p>
<p>Learning is a 24/7 activity</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>A school system that:</b><b></b></p>
<p>Emphasizes achievement not time served</p>
<p>RECOGNIZES THAT THE ESSENCE OF EDUCATION IS A CLOSE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN</p>
<p><span class="Apple-converted-space">               </span>KNOWLEDGEABLE, CARING ADULTS AND SECURE, MOTIVATED STUDENTS<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>BA: I AGREE WITH THIS STATEMENT IF WE CHOSE TO FOCUS ONLY ON K-12. IF WE ARE LOOKING BEYOND THAT WE MIGHT SAY: RECOGNIZES THAT THE ESSENCE OF A QUALITY EDUCATION IS MUTUAL RESPECT AMONG TEACHERS, LEARNERS AND LEARNING STAKEHOLDERS.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><span><b>I AGREE ECM</b><b></b></span></p>
<p>DON: DON’T DISAGREE WITH EITHER BUT THE STATEMENT BUT IT IS OF A DIFFERENT NATURE, IT IS ABOUT THE PROCESS OF EDUCATING</p>
<p>Education Includes meaningful assessment and feedback <span class="Apple-converted-space">               </span></p>
<p>Focuses on learning needs rather than subjects to be taught</p>
<p>Holds teachers accountable for helping learners reach education goals</p>
<p>Is outcomes based</p>
<p>Uses criterion referenced assessment</p>
<p>Supports independent learning</p>
<p>Helps learners prepare for qualifications and not just credentials</p>
