<div class="reader-summary">Letter to editor (dated 7/23/role) titled &quot;The key to education reform.&quot; Don cites Conversation article on reforming public education. Critiques PEI&#x27;s &quot;clarity problem&quot; in education policy, noting Administrative Handbook definition only addresses &quot;children&quot; despite Department serving all ages, and &quot;meaningful place&quot; is too vague for program design. Critiques Department&#x27;s role statement as understatement, proposing it should be &quot;encourage, support and regulate&quot; education services. Argues clear purpose and structure should arise from public discussion, possibly Cabinet or Legislative Assembly debate.</div>

<p><b>The key to education reform</b></p>
<p>My morning reading includes the <b>Conversation</b>, a daily independent online publication out of Toronto; Tuesday’s article on reforming public education triggered this letter.</p>
<p>Public education has a clarity problem. In the interest in being inclusive, those who develop and interpret policy in education, often overlook the need for detail by readers.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>For example, the PEI Administrative Handbook gives the purpose of education as being “to provide for the development of children so that each child may take a meaningful place in society.” That statement is unclear for two reasons. First it only addresses “children”; according to it’s title, the Department serves all ages. Second, in the writer’s view, “a meaningful place” is insufficiently clear to design programs or measure results.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>A second example is on the PEI website which refers to the role of the Department beings “to develop and deliver high quality programs and curriculum in English and French to Island children”.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This is a major understatement of the Department’s role; my understanding, and my interpretation of public understanding, is that the Department’s role is to encourage, support and regulating education services in PEI.</p>
<p>Education needs a clear purpose; the nature and quality of our educational offerings depends on it; so too does the best structure deliver educational services to support it. While it s not the writer’s role to establish a “purpose” it is my belief that purpose should rise from public discussion. Perhaps purpose is a subject even worthy of debate by Cabinet, Caucus or even by the Legislative Assembly as a whole.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
