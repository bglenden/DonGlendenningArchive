<div class="reader-summary">Letter to editor on &quot;A clarity problem.&quot; Don notes World Bank and Canadian educators confuse &quot;going to school&quot; with &quot;getting an education.&quot; Presents his view of education as experiences that changed him over years, demonstrated by what he knows, believes, feels, values, and can do. Critiques PEI Department&#x27;s narrow definition as &quot;develop and deliver curriculum&quot; and proposes broader role as &quot;encouraging, supporting and regulating&quot; education. Notes Department definitions are not readily available to public.</div>

<div class="reader-content">
<p>Editor:</p>
<p>A clarity problem</p>
<p>In an effort to be inclusive, education articles frequently leave out detail important to the reader’s understanding.</p>
<p>The World Bank, for instance, calls attention the fact that Ministries of Education often confuse “going to school” with “getting an education”. that can also be said about Canadian educators as well.</p>
<p>I sense a narrowing of the definition of education in recent years. My own view of education is quite simple, I consider my education to be the result of experiences that have changed me over the years and is demonstrated by what I know, believe, feel, valul and am able to do; I view an education system as a system of services designed to help us get the education we want, need or would like. A good education is a different matter; it is one that allows us to deal with issues that we encounter in our day to day lives.</p>
<p>Given the above, I decided to check prevailing PEI definitions. I must admit that the mastery of modern technology is not one of my accomplishments, however, given the nature and extent of education activities, finding definitions should be a cinch.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Not so. A PEI definition, or at least a definition attributable to the Department<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>did not appear.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>While on line, I checked on the “role of the Department”.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It read “to develop and deliver curriculum in French and English to Island students”.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A much narrower role than I expected and at odds with my discussions with other Islanders.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I consider the role of the Department to be ne of “encouraging, supporting and regulating” education in PEI.</p>
<p>I write the above only to say that what the Department believes education to be is important but is not well understood.</p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
<p><br></p>
