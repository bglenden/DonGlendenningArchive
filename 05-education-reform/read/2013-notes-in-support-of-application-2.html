<p>Mr. Mezaun Baksh</p>
<p>Charities Analyst</p>
<p>Charities Directorate</p>
<p>Canada Revenue Agency</p>

<p><br></p>
<p>Dear Mr. Baksh:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Education 20/20 Inc – file 3050233</p>
<p>To be completed before July 25, 2013</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>This is a response to your letter of May 30, 2013 about and our application for registration as a charitable organization with Canada Revenue Agency.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>While our words may not have conveyed it, there is no doubt in our minds that education is important, the cause of education needs new efforts and voices, and that our vision of services to be offered are consistent with charitable criteria.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>First a comment about education.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Tough economic times, a changed employment market, performance of our students on international tests and the impact of technology are exerting major pressures and demands on our educational institutions.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The view that education and schooling are the same no longer is valid, if it ever was. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Demands cannot be met within the four walls of institutions; other models, more open arrangements, are needed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Compared to the health sector for example, education has few NGOs to provide other points of view, pick up the slack or form partnerships.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Education 20/20 Inc sees itself operating in tis role..<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Universal skills are keyThe eand educational institutions are struggling to cope. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Urgent/key/obvious Issues</b></p>
<p>From a learner or user perspective:</p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li4">There is little on-going meaningful engagement between schools and their community yet evidence shows that<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>schools practicing levels of community engagement result in better quality education</li>
  <li class="li4">The growth of Massive Open On-line Courses (MOOC) opens the door to independent study an also to changing delivery strategies.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Opportunity for students to challenge for Credit</li>
  <li class="li4">Educational institutions grant credentials, employers look for qualifications; both are legitimate but confusion exists between the two.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Young people especially, suffer from the lack of documentation on their<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>skills.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A qualification assessment mechanism would also support independent study and be of value to organizations wanting to give greater consideration to a rounded education rather than schooling.</li>
  <li class="li4">While schools have a greater role than teaching skills required to gain employment, employment is an objective of students.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Statistics on literacy and employability and literacy levels show that 40% or more Islanders, and Canadians as a whole, lack skills required to participate in a modern economy.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If schools don’t provide employability sckills, who should.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Resolving this issue is urgent</li>
  <li class="li4">An OECD study of 11 countries on PISA test results shows that students in schools with significant local autonomy have better test results than traditional schools.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Information of this kind needs to be more widely distruibuted and Governments encouraged to use iin their governance decisions.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Purposes:</b></p>
<p><b>Purposes </b>– although the wording may not reflect it, the organization was established exclusively for the advancement of education. Directors are of the view that, compared to other charitable sectors, education is underserved. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li4">To promote education and educational opportunity for every Canadian</li>

</ul>
<p>A	Research activities will be carried out either by our own staff and volunteers or under contract.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Results will be posted on our website, form the basis for our newsletter and press releases, and help to steer our activities.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>At the moment, we have identified the following areas where information is in short supply:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li4">Employability skills – The Conference Board of Canada has identified some 56 “employability skills”; so far, we have found only one secondary school and a few community colleges using them in any significant way, and none in PEIWe would like to have more information as to their relevance to employers when hiring, their relevance when promoting, and the extent to which job seekers have them or would like to have them.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>.<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Answers to such questions, we believe, would be useful to people looking for work and to schools when developing curriculum.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>To gather the information, we propose to test a new piece of software developed by Quadra in Calgary</li>
  <li class="li4">We know that some students are seeking course credit through a challenge process and we also know that some organizations courses are seeking approval of courses they offer.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Survey results would identify the magnitude of the interest and, perhaps lend support or identify altertnativesGathering informatioOur local media has reported some interest<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
