  Incubators
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Don frames schools as &quot;incubators&quot; where students develop skills for adult life roles. He traces education&#x27;s evolution from apprenticeship models through the industrial revolution&#x27;s mechanics institutes to modern public schools. Drawing on Oregon&#x27;s Education Act, Don identifies six life roles: individual, learner, producer, consumer, family member, and citizen. He argues schools haven&#x27;t adequately specified graduate expectations, creating confusion between what schools think they should do and what communities expect. He emphasizes the need to establish clear standards by resolving the fundamental question of which life roles schools should focus on.</div>

<p><b>SCHOOL STANDARDS – 101</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Schools as Incubators</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I am of the view that the most pressing issue in education today is that of educational standards.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Although my concern applies to all levels, my focus is on the expectations of students leaving the school system.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>While I recognize broader issues, I decided rather arbitrarily to deal only with secondary schools exit standards.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>As I thought about the issue, a number of images came to mind.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The first recalled life in early times where youngsters learned the skills of adulthood from being with parents; some skills are still learned that way.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The second image is that of young people seated on a step in a forum, or perhaps on the side of a hill, listening to and questioning a teacher or a preacher.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I also see apprentices working on great churches.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>From these images it is easy to imagine both the curriculum and standards.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Then along came the industrial revolution.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The industrial revolution was accompanied by major changes in working life and great social upheaval.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>One worker on a machine could do the work of many.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The work was no longer done in the home.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In increasing numbers, workers performed the new tasks in impersonal factories away from home.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>New workers learned the required new skills by “sitting by Nellie”; but over time it became evident that something different and better was needed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In response, mechanics institutes offered an early form of vocational education and classes were organized for the benefit of children of the poor and the unemployed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Formal instruction was limited to “’Reading, ‘Ritin and ‘Rithmetic”.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Eventually these initiatives evolved into the public school system as we know it today. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Over time, the need for and value of education gained almost universal acceptance and today, not only is schooling encouraged, a community’s quality of life and actual future is dependent to a major degree on the education level of its members.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>A school system helps prepare people not only to live a full and enjoyable life but also to contribute for the well-being of others.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But communities, and the lives individuals within them, are so varied<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>where should schools begin?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Most of us fill many roles in a life time.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We are born into a family, it may only be a family of two, a mother and child, but it is a family and most continue a family relationship throughout their lives.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>From day one, the new arrival starts learning and later learners find themselves in school.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Consumer demographics attest to the importance of young people as consumers.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The desire to consume moves people to take on chores around the home, a paper route or work at a fast food restaurant.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>I happen to like the life roles as identified by the Oregon Education Act of 1991.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Six were identified.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They are:</p>
<p>Individual</p>
<p>Learner</p>
<p>Producer</p>
<p>Consumer</p>
<p>Family member, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Citizen. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Schools as incubators</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>People will move into some of these roles without formal schooling but it is generally recognized that, at some point in our lives and for a varying length of time, all people can benefit from help in the form of instruction, advice, coaching, information, counseling and practice.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We have established schools but, in my view, we have not adequately specified what we expect from their graduates.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This we have not done well; confusion exists between what schools think they should do and what the community expects them to do.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Which role or what mix of roles should schools focus on?</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Meaningful and recognized standards cannot be set until this issue is resolved; the process of addressing the issue will dramatically sharpen the debate.</p>
