<div class="reader-summary">Don proposes an alternative education budget approach for 2016 emphasizing priorities and school autonomy. He advocates freezing the budget, prioritizing basic skills (math, science, communications, computer programming), allowing principal discretion over other offerings in consultation with communities, and creating an innovation fund. This approach would align with OECD recommendations for school autonomy while maintaining government control and enhancing community engagement.</div>

<p>Dear Sir:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Priorities for education</p>
<p>The beginning of a new year encourages one to review personal priorities and doing so led me to thinking about priorities in education.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is not a subject often discussed or, at least, not discussed publicly. To those of us on the outside, it appears that each year officials review the relevant statistics, apply the appropriate formula, add a few dollars for special initiatives and present it to the legislature for approval – and all of this will be done with little if any significant input by front line teachers and principals. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Being conscious of the size of the education budget, the desirability of the need for both freedom and accountability at the school level and the desirability of community engagement, let me propose an alternative budget process for 2016:</p>
<p>Freeze the education budget at the 2015 level.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Place a priority on basic skills of math, science, communications and a computer language.</p>
<p>Allow principals to decide other offerings within their allocation and in consultation with the community they serve.</p>
<p>Establish an innovation fund to which schools could for special projects<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>This would give the government the control it needs, significantly increase school autonomy as recommended by the OECD, and make for significant community engagement – all important characteristics of a quality education system.</p>
<p>With best wishes for the new year</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Don Glendenning</p>
<p>A long-time student of education</p>
