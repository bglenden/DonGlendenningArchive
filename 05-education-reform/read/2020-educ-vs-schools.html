  2020 educ vs schools
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Two-part letter presenting Don&#x27;s central thesis: education encompasses all learning (home, travel, social occasions, personal exploration) while schools are merely institutions delivering instruction. Educators conflate these concepts, hindering PEI educational quality. Don advocates Oregon&#x27;s &quot;life roles&quot; framework (citizen, individual, student, family member, provider, consumer) as curriculum starting point with citizen advisory bodies. He argues the Department should either broaden its mission or revert to its former name, &quot;Department of Public Instruction,&quot; as governments now frame their role narrowly as producing programs for schools rather than advancing comprehensive education.</div>

<p><b>Dear Editor</b></p>
<p><b>Honesty in labelling</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>Educators are reluctant to talk about education; they prefer to talk about schools. Even worse, some educators do not, cannot, will not differentiate between the two. That inability or unwillingness stands in the way of improving the quality of education in Prince Edward Island. Let me elaborate.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>My experience suggests that<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>education, like health or agriculture, is all encompassing it includes<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>governance, counselling, information, quality assurance, curriculum development and probably others; it also includes instruction, which is largely delivered in schools.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But education also includes things learned at home, during travel, on social occasions and even through one’s own explorations.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That’s not to say that school is not important but rather that the Department has a greater mission than running schools.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The narrowness of role probably accounts for<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>gaps in continuing educatinm=, career courses and night classes</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Our current and former Governments saw their tole as one of producing and delivering programs to schools.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If that’s is really their role, perhaps they should operate under the name of yesteryear, Department of Public Instruction.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Dear Editor:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Some years ago, the State of Oregon adopted “life roles” as a key component of their educational planning. They concluded that, during a normal lifetime, each citizen plays the role of a citizen, individual, student, family member, provider and consumer.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I find this a useful place to start my thinking about education services.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Since education helps people prepare for various life roles, that should also be a good place to look for what people should learn – to start curriculum building, so to speak. An advisory body drawn from citizens would be a good place to start.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Sincerely<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Don Glendenning</p>
<p><br></p>
