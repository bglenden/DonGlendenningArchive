  2016-7 Language of learning  
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Don emphasizes precise language in education discourse, tracing his attention to clarity back to learner-centered lesson planning, competency-based outcomes, and Ed Macintosh&#x27;s &quot;fog index&quot; for writing clarity. He questions the Department of Education&#x27;s phrase &quot;delivering excellence,&quot; noting it&#x27;s ambiguous regarding what is delivered, how, and to whom. He argues that since learning is a personal act only learners can perform, excellence language should clarify whether it applies to learner achievement, teacher delivery, or institutional support, and how it will be measured—essential for accountability and student understanding.</div>

<p>Editor,</p>
<p>Charlottetown Guardian</p>
<p>Charlottetown, PEI	</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Dear Sir:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><b>Language of learning</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>I struggle with words when writing letters to the Editor; it probably goes back to my days of writing learner-centered lesson plans and developing competency based outcomes; but it may also reflect the impact of Ed Macintosh, who not only introduced me to welding, but also insisted that I apply a “fog index” to everything I write. It can also be applied to what I read. <span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>A brief description of the learning partnership on the Department of Education website speaks of “delivering excellence”.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I like the phrase but am not sure what it means when applied to learners and learning.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Learning is a personal act; only a learner can learn.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Groups or classes do not learn although learners may learn in a group setting.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In short, I am not sure what the excellence applies to.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>A second consideration involves “delivery”; is excellence delivered, encouraged, supported or modeled?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I assume that it will be delivered by teachers but just how they will do that is unclear, as is how excellence will it be measured? If I were a teacher, I certainly would be wondering how “delivering excellence” applies to me or if I had a child in school, I would be wondering how this concept applies to him or her.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Some may consider these comments as simply nitpicking, however, I consider them to be key to good communication about and accountability for the education of our young people.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Don Glendenning</p>
<p>A long-time student of education</p>
