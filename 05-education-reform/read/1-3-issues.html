<div class="reader-summary">Third draft of an editor letter refining Don&#x27;s educational philosophy and critique. Defines learning, teaching, and education with philosophical clarity, distinguishing between personal development and the economic sector. Observes that during his 50-year tenure on PEI, education has shifted from service to product, from professional practice to credential-focused delivery. Calls for comprehensive system review including glossary of terms, program purposes, institutional autonomy, accountability definitions, and collaborative redesign led by local leaders rather than outside experts.</div>

<p>Dear Editor:</p>
<p>Draft 3</p>
<p>Issues in Education</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>For some time now, I have engaged with Islanders in conversations about education; topics include learners, learning, continuing education, math, politicization, transition to employment, autonomy, accountability, and the list goes on. My conversations reveal a desire for information and dialogue, not just about school matters, but also about education - and how it can be improved.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>At its simplest, learning refers to a person engaging in an activity intended to change the way they think, feel or act; teaching, on the other hand, is a process helping others change the way they think, feel or act. One’s education is the result of the experiences that have altered the ways that a person thinks, feels or acts. Having an education or being educated may be thought of as a person’s stage of development; people with a good education are better able to deal better with circumstances they encounter throughout their lives than persons with a limited education. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Education is also a sector of the economy; a large and complex set of programs and services intended to help people learn; services such as information, instruction, counselling, finance, learning products, technology, quality assurance, governance and people.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Given a population of nearly 160,000 people, a Department of Education has potentially a large pool of clients needing or wanting help.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>	It appears to me that the meaning of education has narrowed since 	my arrival on PEI some 50 years ago; education is now thought of and 	treated as a product rather than a service. The emphasis has shifted to 	getting “a 	high 	school, college or university diploma or degree” 	rather than 	getting a teacher’s license, journeyman’s standing or 	engineering qualification; PISA results have replaced community `	`standards. Islanders frequently comment on the loss of PVI and PCVH.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  	</span>One should 	also note the passing of a federal-provincial partnership in 	terms of the education of adults.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>	The results of my explorations call for review of the system – a 	glossary of common definitions, clearly stated program purposes, 	conceptual clarity, defined autonomy and accountability of individuals 	and institutions, increased collaboration between providers and users 	of education services, holistic or universal rating scales, more 	informative student transcripts and greater recognition of the 	importance of context. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>	But let’s start with public conversations about our needs.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Let’s 	engage Islanders in conversation about what they need and want by 	way of education, develop a clear statement of the ideal education for 	both individuals and the Island Community, and the overarching 	principles that will guide its operation. Everything should be on the<span class="Apple-converted-space">  	</span>table. The process should be led by local leaders assisted by outside 	specialists 	if needed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Members of the Legislature perhaps?</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>	Once the report is tabled, we should review the implementation 	process’</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Don Glendenning</p>
