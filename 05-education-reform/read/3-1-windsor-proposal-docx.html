<p>Windsor Proposal</p>
<p><b>Introduction</b></p>
<p>Education 20/20 Inc. was federally incorporated as an independent, broad based, national, not-for-profit education organization, located in Charlottetown, PEI and is governed by a volunteer Board of Directors.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Our vvision is of a quality education for every Canadian and mission is to support and strengthen a culture of learning for all Canadians.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The organization operates with ten Directors, a network of some fifty people, and a mailing list of about 250.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>An application for charitable status has been filed with Canada Revenue Agency; in the meantime, The Community Foundation of Prince Edward Island accepts donations and pays invoices on our behalf. I should point out that Education 20/20 Inc. is unique among educational organizations in Canada in that it is unaligned with any educational institutions, grade levels, subject field or cause.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Attached you will find a list of activities carried out to date, activities planned for the coming year and a brief biography of our Directors. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><span>One of our major issues in education arises from concerns by students and the community at large about the level of basic education skills demonstrated by young people, including high school graduates.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As evidence I refer to </span>PISA test results; recent CFPEI survey of Island youth; a presentation to a Standing Committee of the PEI Legislative Assembly by the Charlottetown area chamber of Commerce; How Canada Performs, a Provincial and Territorial Ranking, Education and Training; Education and Skills, and a series of workshops on Preparedness held throughout PEI by Education 20/20 Inc.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The PEI Department of Education has not taken exception to the findings nor, to the best of our knowledge, assumed a leadership role that includes corrective action.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>After some exploration and deliberation, Education 20/20 settled on a pilot in the area of math.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We did so because, during our discussions, math usually appeared first when discussing the issue of basic skills; secondly, there appear to be fewer cultural issues around math than other basic education skills.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We also found some expertise in the community with an interest in participating in the exploration of the math component of the gap as a potential starting place. The remainder of this proposal will focus on math. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Purpose</b></p>
<p>Our purpose is<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>(1) to<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>provide stakeholders with detail about the math gap and<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>(2) to provide a framework for closing the gap.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Project<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p>The first step in solving the problem, we believe, is to confirm the nature and complexity of the education gap as perceived and experienced by users of basic education services, namely students, employers, postsecondary institutions and the community at large.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Steps include<span>:</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li4">Searching the literature to gather resource materials relevant to the project</li>
  <li class="li4">Undertaking an analysis of competencies that form the basic math pool.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This in itself is not a curriculum but is simply an identification of the competencies that constitute the mathematics used in every-day life by citizens of Prince Edward Island; some may use it for curriculum development, others may use it for tracking student progress while still others may use it as part of an assessment process.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The analysis will be based on the DACUM approach which calls for major input by users not providers of education services.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The analysis group of 8-12 people, led by a trained facilitator, will be revising an earlier analysis developed at Holland College; members of the analysis group will be mostly “users” of the product, employers, community members and postsecondary institutions.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li4">Identify a profile or profiles of math skills believed to be important for citizenship, for work entry and for entry into postsecondary institutions. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li4">Prepare a criterion reference rating scale reflective of Bloom’s Taxonomy.</li>
  <li class="li4">Establish a benchmark</li>
  <li class="li4">Recommend an assessment process.</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Benefits:</b></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li4">Brings clarification of the issue of basic skills</li>
  <li class="li4">An aid to self study</li>
  <li class="li4">An aid to employers when hiring new employees</li>
  <li class="li4">Improve communications between and among stakeholders<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li4">Demonstrate some components absent from the current educational process</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Request</b></p>
<p>This letter constitutes a request to the Windsor Foundation, a first for Education 20/20 Inc., for financial support to investigate the nature of the education gap, at least from the perspective of users of the education service – students, parents, community, employers, postsecondary institutions and, others. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
