  2014 The education payroll
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">An incomplete draft comparing the Minister of Education&#x27;s extensive control over personnel and delivery to other provincial ministries like Health. Don argues the Minister not only sets curriculum and scheduling but has all education providers on his payroll with direct reporting lines to him. He begins drawing comparisons to Health (which contracts with independent professionals) but the piece trails off incomplete, leaving the full argument undeveloped.</div>

<div class="reader-content">
<p>All on the education payroll</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>No Minister has more control over the operation of a sector than the Minister of Education.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He not only determines what we will learn and when, where and by whom it will be delivered, but he has all the people who deliver education on his payroll.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Think for a moment; how many educational services can you name that are not provided directly by government employees with a direct reporting line to the minister; if the Minister’s employees don’t provide the service, you probably won’t get it.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Power not just influence</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Compare thst with the Minister of Health, for instance with an equally larege budgetCompare this with the minister of health</p>
