<p><b>Competencies and Learning Outcomes</b></p>
<p>by David Gosselin, University of Nebraska-Lincoln</p>
<p>Competencies and learning outcomes are two related educational terms that can create confusion. Competencies and outcomes can be written to describe the learning gained by students in individual courses (course outcomes) or for the program as a whole (program outcomes). They DO NOT mean the same thing. We will follow the lead of<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>HYPERLINK "http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1541-4329.2004.tb00047.x/pdf" <span>Hartel and Foegeding (2004)</span> and use the following working definitions:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Competency:</b> A <i>general</i> statement that describes the desired knowledge, skills, and behaviors of a student graduating from a program (or completing a course). Competencies commonly define the applied skills and knowledge that enable people to successfully perform in professional, educational, and other life contexts. <br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Key Distinction:</b> A true learning outcome is written so that it can be measured or assessed. It focuses on what the student is able to do at end of a program (or course). Thus, learning outcomes are the basis for an assessment program that focuses on what a student can or should be able to do either upon completion of a course or upon graduation from a program. The term learning outcome is used more commonly in the context of a program or course of instruction. The term competency is more commonly used in relation to professional fields (i.e. dentistry, nursing).</p>
