  A Dear Editor
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Don contends that PEI&#x27;s education system is &quot;really only a school system&quot; requiring structural overhaul. The World Bank, largest public education contributor, cautions countries against confusing schooling with education. PEI does conflate them, focusing on serving youth in schools rather than all Islanders across ages, interests, and capabilities. Education is a service to help people gain/develop knowledge, skills, attitudes, values, and attributes; collaboration between educators and community is essential. Standard education services include information, counseling, learning products, technology, analysis, instruction, human resources, and tracking. Services should be clearly identified and promoted, with help tailored to individual learner needs. Restructuring should begin with: (1) common understanding of education; (2) clear purpose; (3) identified services. Don concludes by asserting PEI has internal expertise; it needs only to act on it rather than hiring external consultants. This letter synthesizes his reform vision into actionable steps.</div>

<p><b>Dear Editor:</b></p>
<p><b>Our education system needs a structural overhaul; to be more precise, I believe our education system is really only a school system.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b>The World Bank, the largest financial contributor to public education, cautions countries about confusing going to school with getting an education. I believe we do that in PEI. We have a system focused on serving youth in school settings. What we should have is an education system that serves Islanders of all age, interests and capabilities whether in school or engaged in independent study.</b></p>
<p><b>“Educating” is a service intended to help people gain or develop their knowledge, skills, attitudes, values and other attributes; collaboration between educators and the community is key. Typical education services include information, counselling, learning products and technology, analysis, instruction, human resources and a tracking system. Services should be clearly identified and promoted although the nature and amount of help needed varies from learner to learner</b></p>
<p><b>Based on my conversations, a restructuring is in order and should start with a common understanding of education, a clear purpose and list of services offered.</b></p>
<p><b>Finally, let me say that I am not suggesting the need of an “outside” expert. ; we have the expertise. We just need to do it.</b></p>
<p><b>Sincerely<br>
Don Glendenning</b></p>
