  5 Self correcting
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Letter dated January 10, 2019, from Don to Charlottetown Guardian criticizing public education&#x27;s lack of self-correcting mechanisms and responsiveness to user needs. He argues that unlike market-driven sectors, education faces no natural pressure for change because school attendance is mandatory and alternatives are scarce. He advocates for OECD models combining school autonomy with teacher accountability, and notes emerging alternatives in curriculum development, educational products, technology delivery, and qualification awarding.</div>

<p><b>Editor,</b></p>
<p><b>Charlottetown Guardian</b></p>
<p><b>Charlottetown, PEI	</b></p>
<p><b>Draft-5</b></p>
<p><b>Dear Sir:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b><b></b></p>
<p><b>Public schools need a self-correcting mechanism<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>I cannot think of any service less affected by individual user needs and interests than public education; it sails merrily along its own way seemingly oblivious to the needs. interests and priorities of the people it was designed to serve. The only tool for change, is a pending election, but even changes resulting therefrom are mostly an illusion.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>For most sectors, change is triggered by a drop-in client numbers or change in the bottom line; neither apply to education.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Youngsters are required to attend school, given the monopoly, studies are largely prescribed and alternatives are expensive and/or scares.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The OECD favours quality control through a combination of school autonomy and teacher accountability; neither seem to have found favour with public educators in Canada. Bundling or unbundling of services are never debated nor has the separation of instruction nd standards.</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Perhaps we should consider a level of literacy or numeracy a requirement for opening a bank account, getting a driver’s license or being allowed into a bar or club; finally, I should mention the rise of alternative service providers in such areas as curriculum development, education products, technological delivery and, now it seems, the awarding of qualifications</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Sincerely,</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Don Glendenning</b></p>
<p><b>A long-time student of education</b></p>
