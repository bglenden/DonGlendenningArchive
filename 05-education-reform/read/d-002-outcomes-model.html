  D 002 Outcomes model
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Comprehensive analysis of education outcomes and outcome-based education (OBE) models. Discusses the complexity of educational issues including curriculum, qualifications, and accountability. Proposes upgrading OBE models and establishing clear, measurable educational outcomes developed in consultation with communities. Critiques current system as administrative convenience-driven rather than learner-focused, lacking transparency and professional decision-making at school level. Addresses systemic weaknesses including time-based rather than performance-based models, batch processing, lack of learning culture, and poor credit for prior learning.

	</p>
	<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><b>BACKGROUND</b></p>
	<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">Education is a lifelong process
	involving experiences that have a formative effect on the way we
	feel, think and act; this effect is usually expressed in terms of a
	person’s attitudes, skills and knowledge.  Major contributors to
	one’s education include one’s self, one’s home and extended
	family, schools and the community at large.   Schools play a unique
	role in the provision of education in that they are the only
	provider of educational services allowed to award credentials, the
	folded paper, so esteemed by our society.</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">It is widely recognized that
	education is a key factor in determining one’s quality of life; in
	the same way, the collective education of our citizens will
	determine to a significant degree the future of our community and
	country. Because of this, we are among the world leaders in our
	investment in ensuring that our citizens, especially our youth, have
	access to a variety of educational activities and experiences.  Our
	education system developed over decades and served us well, however,
	there are significant changes occurring around us that demand some
	different responses; our education system is unlikely to make the
	desired changes by itself.  But there is a gap between what
	Islanders have and what they want in the way of education.  Not only
	is there a gap, but Islanders want meaningful engagement in bringing
	about the change. There is no panacea in sight and there is not
	likely to be one, however, change must be immediate, significant and
	continuous, but planned. Most comment is focused on changes to the
	school system, however, the issue is broader than that, it must
	encompass not only schools, but the broader education including the
	role of the home and community; any review must also include a
	variety of issues including expectations, the need for collaboration
	and engagement, credentials and standards, personal freedom and
	accountability.</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in"><b>ISSUES</b></p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">Issues are topics, problems or
	concerns of importance to groups of people; they are the big
	questions.    Issues are not simple problems for which definitive
	answers can easily be found.  On the contrary, they are complex and
	of significance. Once understood, the simpler questions can be dealt
	with and progress resumed.   It’s not always easy to describe an
	issue in precise terms; sometimes we confuse issues with symptoms
	and incidents.  An issue may be current, that is a problem of today;
	emerging and potential issues, on the other hand, focus on those
	threats and opportunities that are like to impact on life tomorrow. 
	But the field is messy.  Issues arise in a variety of ways but often
	become of concern when they impact on personal interests, activities
	or events, or are related in some way to concerns of friends or
	family.  When trying to sort through issues, it is often useful to
	begin one’s analysis with the basic questions of who, what, when,
	where and why.  It may also be useful to browse or skim broadly in
	the field, such as browsing the internet, to get a feel for the
	issues.  In the case of education, while the organization is mine</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">There are many ways to frame and
	describe issues, for the purpose of this paper, I’ve decided to
	focus on the following six:</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in"><br />
<br />

	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in"><b>Curriculum </b>
	</p>
	<p lang="en-US" style="margin-right: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0in; orphans: 0; widows: 0; line-height: 0.2in">
	<span lang="en-GB">Most
	educators would agree that curriculum development should commence
	with clearly defined outcomes.  Starting with outcomes changes the
	focus of education from content to learners and organizes teaching
	and learning around outcomes and measures change based on
	performance regardless of when the learning took place.  Outcomes
	may be written with “</span>traditional,
	transitional, or transformational goals in mind”.   It appears
	that the leadership in OBE dealt with broad principles only; as a
	result there are no recognized standards for identifying out comes
	or implementing OBE. As a result, there are many versions of OBE,
	most focusing on outcomes only. 
	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in"><b>Qualifications</b></p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in"><span lang="en-US">The acquiring of
	an education and the certification of qualifications are two
	separate functions although the two are closely linked and
	frequently one is thought to be the other.  The fact that the
	delivery of both functions is, to a large degree, provided or driven
	by educational institutions often works to the individual’s
	disadvantage in terms of both education and certification.  While
	separate certification bodies exist, they appear to place undue
	emphasis on results of study and too little emphasis on what has
	been learned outside the formal education system.</span></p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in"><br />
<br />

	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">Most would agree that education is
	broad, lifelong and all encompassing, yet in practice we implement a
	more limited vew including:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">Inflating the role of
		schooling and education by using the terms interchangeably,</p></li>
		<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">Failing to support students in
		their search for qualifications.</p></li>
		<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">Ignoring the need for
		independent advice to learners and their parent</p></li>
		<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">Narrowing the curriculum focus</p></li>
		<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">Schoolification of early
		childhood development</p></li>
		<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">Limited support for
		Independent and life long learning</p></li>
		<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">Bias towards postsecondary
		education at the expense of employability skills and skpll training</p></li>
	</ul>
	<p style="margin-left: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0.14in"><b>NOTE; 
		Need to review and modify foundation, involve public, clear
	language, principles, definitions, what education is needed, how
