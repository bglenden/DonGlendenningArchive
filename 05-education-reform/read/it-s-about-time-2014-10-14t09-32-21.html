<p><br></p>
<p>Dear Sir:</p>
<p>The crux of the problem</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I didn’t have a happy Thanksgiving, in fact most of the past month has been stressful.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The cause of my stress is an event in the life of a student, a person I have never met but whose family I know and future has been limited because of the way we organize schools and operate schools.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is not the I’ve hear similar stories before.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>A high school student, with hopes, even plans to go to college or university, was having difficulty with math; that’s not unusual, I am told, many people struggle with a subject and struggling with math is not uncommon. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>So what are the options?</p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li1">Let the a student struggle and likely fail a grade</li>
  <li class="li1">Provide extra instruction</li>
  <li class="li1">Transfer to a lower level of the subject</li>
  <li class="li1">Recommend that they continue and take an upgrading course after they graduate</li>
  <li class="li1">Allow them to drop the class but not graduate</li>
  <li class="li1">Provide each teacher with an aspirin allowance</li>
  <li class="li1">Blame the home</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p>The correct action is obvious; provide more help.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A system that allows other options is out dated to say the least and extremely limiting to the future of our young people and our communities.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>During the past few weeks, I’ve had a number of conversations about math, conversations with people in all walks of life.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Arising out of these conversations are a number of recommendations; two are worthy of being passed on:</p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li1">Create a math ladder that sets out a number of clearly identified levels</li>
  <li class="li1">Report achievement in terms of which rung a student has reached</li>
  <li class="li1">Establish a math assessment service, apart from teachers, for assessing each students level.</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p>Correcting situations like this, although not as sexy as PCAP and PISA, are at the heart of securing our future.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Don Glendenning</p>
<p>A long time student of education</p>
