<div class="reader-summary">Supporting &quot;elected trustees&quot; returning to public education agenda, Don first reviewed the Schools Act and Department documents. He identified concerns: (1) Department describes role narrowly as &quot;developing and delivering programs&quot; to youth; he argues it should be &quot;encouraging and supporting Islanders to gain skills, knowledge and attitudes to thrive in democracy&quot;; (2) World Bank notes ministries confuse schooling with education. Don concludes boards&#x27; usefulness depends on decisions allowed/encouraged. Based on experience and research from Montreal Economic Institute, OECD, and World Bank, he recommends the province first update its education vision statement. Clear vision makes appropriate structure evident, enabling better decisions about school roles and trustee necessity. He cites Education 2020 Inc.&#x27;s 2015 recommendation for &quot;a clear and compelling vision of education for all Islanders&quot;—still valid a decade later. This letter connects governance structure to vision, treating boards as secondary to foundational policy clarity.</div>

<p>I believe in the public education system.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I was pleased, therefore, a few days ago when my morning paper carried an item that “elected trustees” is back on the agenda.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Government was seeking public input; I decided to write a letter of support.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>First, however, I reviewed the Schools Act and scanned a few items on the internet. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>My review of Department of Education documents revealed two items of concern.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>First, the Department describes its role as one of<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“developing and delivering programs” to the young.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I beg to differ. I believe that The Department has a leadership role in” encouraging and supporting Islanders” to gain the skills, knowledge and attitudes to thrive in a democracy”. Unfortunately, as the World Bank points out, Ministries don’t realize the difference between going to school and getting an education.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The key to whether Boards are useful, I concluded, depends on the decisions they are allowed or encouraged to make. Based on my own experience and recent documents from the <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Montreal Economic Institute, the OECD and the World Bank, I feel that the Province should first update its education vision statement.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>With a well-defined vision, the matter of an appropriate structure will be more evident.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Only then can we decide the role of schools and whether or not trustees are needed or beneficial.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>For the record, Education 2020 Inc. published a paper on education in April, 2015 with the first recommendation being the development of “a clear and compelling vision of education for all Islanders”. That recommendation is still valid.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
<p><br></p>
