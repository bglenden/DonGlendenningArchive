  2 Aftermarket
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Don addresses gaps between parental expectations and school delivery as identified in PISA results, arguing that improvement requires changes at the critical teacher-learner interface. He identifies two categories of problems: those within teacher control (diagnosis, teaching techniques, communication) and those external to teachers (curriculum materials, time allocation, technology, unclear outcomes). Don emphasizes that systemic issues often create barriers even for competent teachers, and advises against blaming students for achievement gaps. He recommends comprehensive diagnosis identifying patterns of failure before implementing reforms, maintaining focus on the classroom interaction point.</div>

<p><br></p>
<p>Dear Editor:</p>
<p><b>Expectations Differ</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Recent PISA (Program for lnternational Student Assessment) results reveal a gap between what parents</p>
<p>expect and what schools deliver.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Based on my experience, the problem requires changes at the point where the teacher and learner</p>
<p>meet. The cause may I rest with the teacher; on the other hand, the cause may be the result of</p>
<p>conditions outside the teacher's control, but it will rnost likely be a bit of both.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>As to the role of the teacher, improvement may call for earlier or better diagnosis, frequent testing, new</p>
<p>or changed teaching techniques, clearer communication, more demonstrations, restating of</p>
<p>expectations and standards, or even the referral to specialists.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>On the other hand, fault may lie with things outside the teacher's control such as choice of text books</p>
<p>and other resource material, time available to teach, need for more technology, unclear outcomes,</p>
<p>incomplete student records, a better mix of independent and group study, and the lists go on. A mix of</p>
<p>remedies will be likely required and it is unlikely that the same remedy will apply to all students and all</p>
<p>schools.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>On occasion, the problem may lie with the student, but we should not start the search for improvement</p>
<p>from that assumption.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>No doubt, on closer examination, patterns will become clear and changes will be required elsewhere in</p>
<p>the system - but the focus should always be on the place where teacher and learner meet.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
