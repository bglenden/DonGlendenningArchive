  D 2015 Role of government
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Don argues that PEI has a school system lacking purpose, service orientation, value, worth, and direction, rather than a true education system. He advocates for expanding beyond classroom delivery to include tutoring, study centres in libraries, a separate qualification authority, continuing education, and support for self-directed learners. He critiques box schools for their inability to cater to individual needs and calls for educational diversity including specialized schools. The letter emphasizes that implementing these changes requires bold government action and premier-level leadership. This reflects his inclusive vision of education as serving all learners across the lifespan, not just youth in traditional classroom settings.</div>

<p>Editor, Charlottetown Guardian</p>
<p>Charlottetown, PEI	</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Dear Sir:</p>
<p>Where change should start</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Change in education can begin in many places, should begin in many places, but must begin where we are – and soon. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Reshaping education will take the efforts of all of us, and the leadership of the Premier. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>First of all, we do not have an education system; we have a school system, a school system that lacks a sense of purpose, a sense of service, a sense of value, a sense of worth and a sense of direction.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Education needs a grander vision than that of designing, developing and delivering courses to young people in a school setting. Instead we need a vision of helping Islanders of all ages to develop the attitudes, skills and knowledge needed to move with confidence into and around the chaotic world that surrounds us.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The knowledge of how to do better is out there; the willingness to make or let change happen is not.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The answer is to create an education system by adding such services as tutoring and study centres within our libraries, a separate qualification authority to replace the hodge podge of credentials, to expand continuing education activities and to encourage self- directed learners.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Building an education system will take bold government action; the Premier’s leadership will be key.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Don Glendenning</p>
<p>A long-time student of education</p>
