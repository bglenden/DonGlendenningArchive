  88-12 learning and school
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Article No. 88 (June 4, 2020) clarifies the distinction between &quot;going to school&quot; and &quot;getting an education,&quot; citing a 2018 World Bank report. Don emphasizes that learning results in behavioral change and can occur anywhere, not just in schools, yet many Islanders (including educators) conflate education with schooling. He explains that communities encourage and fund learning they deem valuable (medicine, mechanics, policing) and that while schools are purpose-built facilities, attending school does not guarantee good education. The piece advocates for holistic rating scales, competency-based learning, self-paced programs, and democratic school governance while criticizing the current politically-filtered conversation focused on administrivia rather than meaningful educational change.</div>

	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><b>A
	recent report by the World Bank called attention to the fact going
	to school and getting an education are different functions and
	should not be confused.(World Bank – 2018)  I was actually asked a
	number of years ago on PEI, where I got my education; it turned out
	the person really wanted to know where I went to school.  I suspect
	that that view is widely held; my personal experience suggests that
	many Islanders, including  professional educators, fail to
	differentiate. </b>

	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><b>Learning
	results in a change in behaviour and is demonstrated through the ay
	we think, feel and act.  Learning itself is neutral, whether good or
	bad for ourselves or rhe community, it is still learning.</b></p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><b>Communities
	believe that some kinds of learning are good for individuals and
	good for the community in which they live. They not only encourage
	that kind of learning but they help pay for it.  Because medical
	doctors, mechanics and policemen are needed to ensure people are
	safe, they often pay for that also.  </b>

	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><b>Learning
	can happen anywhere; some of our most important learning takes place
	at home; sometimes because of numbers or special circumstances,
	communities build purpose built buildings and insist that learners
	go there when they need help; these places are called schools. But
	as the World bank points out, just because you’ve done some
	learning in schools doesn’t mean that you have a good education.</b></p>

	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><b>How
	well one performs in a subject depends to a large extent, on the
	reason for studying the subject.  person or body doing the
	measuring.  For example, one does not need to know a great deal
	about an automobile to be a good driver. </b>

	<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Islanders
	want our students to be literate and numerate, to become independent
	learners, to take care of themselves and learn how to work and play
	together. Education’s business is to help Islanders gain new and
	better skills, knowledge, attitudes and values.  We wonder if  our
	students would benefit from holistic rating scales, competency based
	learning, self- paced programs self-assessment and schools operating
	on democratic principles.

	politically filterd and often bogged down on matters of
	administrivia (school upgrading, credits, grades, noon meals,
	technology, etc.) at the expense of changes that help Islanders gain
	knowledge, skills, attitudes and values needed to help them to
	thrive in later life.</p>

	change to happen.  The World Bank recently chided Ministries of
	Education for not upgrading their own operation and  for with
	holding autonomy from schools.</p>

	that counts is the part provided o young people in schools.

	</p>
	<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Education
	needs a plan, something simple, some definitions, some guiding
	principles, description of services to be offered, services covered
	by government, and an organization that reflects the task at hand. 
	Such a statement should be short, sharp and developed with public
	input – but not by outside experts.</p>
