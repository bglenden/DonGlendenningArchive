</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Formal occasional paper (No. 8, June 1, 2018) addressing comprehensive mathematics education reform framework. Begins with Community Foundation of PEI youth survey (2013) identifying preparedness gaps and Education 20/20&#x27;s subsequent engagement. Emphasizes mathematics as essential citizen-level skill learnable by all Islanders. Details instruction providers: public schools (mandatory annual instruction through graduation with grade-based achievement reporting and streaming), postsecondary institutions (UPEI programs and School of Mathematics and Computational Science), SkillsPEI (federally funded training), private schools (province-aligned), and independent learners. Establishes basic educational beliefs: learning as individual matter, group setting constraints, behavior-change resultants, teacher enablement roles, self-correction lack, education independence from school attendance, achievement over time emphasis, and non-grading educational functions. Details instructional support services including governance, information, learning products, competency maps, assessment criteria, rating scales, profiles, instruction, human resources, and learning opportunities. Documents field developments: MPHEC format changes, competency-based education trends, holistic rating scales, independent field analysis, school ungrading, independent qualification authorities, streaming disappearance, and lifelong education services. Presents ten system conclusions and comprehensive nine-part recommendation set addressing belief statements, competency-based outcomes, curriculum platforms, education term lexicons, profile identification, and learning guides. Details extensive benefits including employer tools, SkillsPEI platforms, job-seeker transcripts, counseling tools, provider communication, instructional relevance, worker upgrade guidance, and professional organization references.</div>

<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">In
late 2013, The Community Foundation of Prince Edward Island (CFPEI)
undertook a survey of over 200 Island youth to identify issues that
directly affected them; the report, T<u>aking
the Pulse of Island Youth</u>,
available on the Foundation<span lang="en-US">’s</span>
website at <u><a href="http://www.cfpei.ca/">www.cfpei.ca</a>,</u>
provides a snapshot of the findings.  Bright
spots include a positive sense of community, emerging entrepreneurial
spirit, volunteerism and new postsecondary offerings. The main
concerns include a lack of jobs, surviving on low-paying jobs,
educational deficiencies and drug and alcohol addictions.  On the
subject of education and learning, the study reports a high rate of
completion of high school and postsecondary education, a high level
of inclusivity and relatively affordable tuition costs; young people
also expressed concerns about their readiness for the next stage of
life including:

<br />

</p>
<p align="justify" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Following
the publication of the CFPEI Report, Education 20/20 organized six
public discussions for the purpose of informing the community of the
report and its findings, learning more about youth issues in our
communities, exploring issues of education and learning, and to
identify actions to be taken to close gaps.  Discussions were lively
and wide ranging and carried on well after formal sessions ended.  
Education 20/20 retained an interest in the subject and was
encouraged to resume discussions with providers and users of
educational services, especially following the report of the Council
of Ministers in July of 2016, which said</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><br />

</p>
<p align="center" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">“<i><b>A
student’s ability to transition from secondary school to
post-secondary education and the labour market is a key measure of
the education system’s success for students” –</b></i></p>
<p align="center" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">
<i><b>CMEC, July 2016</b></i></p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><br />

</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Since then,
transition through education has been the subject of a number of
informal discussions with educators, employers, students and the
community at large.  It is the writer’s view that, at the minimum,
there is an issue of communication among parties involved or
interested in the subject, a communication gap resulting from the
number of service providers, lack of joint planning and limited
ongoing coordination.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><br />

</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Mathematics is the
study of the science of number, quantity and space; it is in demand
to some degree by all citizens,  employers, institutions and the
community at large. The Oregon Department of Education contends that
math provides “a foundation for the study of science and technology
as well as the interpretation of quantitative information in other
subjects. Mathematics may be structured
in a number of ways but structure does not appear to have a
particular influence on the quality of instruction.  
</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><br />

</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Math is an essential
skill needed to some level by all citizens and can be learned to the
citizen level by all or practically all Islanders.  Furthermore,
helping citizens acquire math skills for citizenship is one of the
key roles of our public-school system but there appears to be no
agreement, however, as to the nature and level of citizen math and
how it should be determined.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><br />

</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><b>MATH EDUCATION </b>
</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">A person’s
education begins early; the ability to count is often quoted in
reference to a child starting school and is often used by parents to
support a view that their child is “bright”.  At the same time,
many parents, unintentionally I am sure, encourage the view that math
is difficult, and the literature tells us that a person’s beliefs
about mathematics can have a substantial impact on their interest,
their enjoyment and their motivation in math classes. 
</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><br />

</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Providers of math
instruction: in PEI include:</p>
<ol>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in"><b>The public-school system</b>
	plays a key role in increasing and formalizing each student’s
	knowledge of math.  The school system accepts all children and not
	only provides but requires math instruction each year through to
	graduation. Math to be learned is identified for each grade and
	achievement in the time available is reported to parents and the
	public alike. Performance across course offerings has become a
	screening mechanism in the transition process.</p></li>
</ol>
<p style="margin-left: 1.04in; margin-bottom: 0.14in"><br />
<br />

</p>
<ol start="2">
	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><b>Postsecondary
	institutions </b>provide math instruction in support of programs or
	majors generally; in addition, UPEI offers a math major and most
	recently created a School of Mathematics and Computational Science.</p></li>
</ol>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.14in"><br />
<br />

</p>
<ol start="3">
	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><b>SkillsPEI</b>
	is a federally funded agency that purchases training under federal
	criteria.  The writer is unclear as to how instructional content is
	determined or achievement measured   Instruction in math may be
	provided by provincial schools and institutions, by employers and
	their organizations or NGO’s on behalf of clients.  Content is
	determined or agreed upon at time of purchase. Except for adult
	upgrading, there appears to be little coordination of math content
	across courses. It doesn’t appear that NGO operators can or do tap
	into available provincial instructional resources prepared elsewhere
	in the system</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><b>Private
	schools</b> offer instruction with content being aligned with the
	relevant provincial curriculum. 
	</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><b>Individuals
	</b>may study and improve their math skills on their own or with the
	help of family, friends, tutors, on line courses and other personal
	learning strategies. Independent learners lack a simple mechanism
	for demonstrating their proficiency levels</p></li>
</ol>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><br />

</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Outcomes and
competencies themselves are “gradeless” meaning that that any
competency can be studied in public school, college and university or
independently.  What changes is the level achieved on each outcome.
As to proficiency levels, there appears to be some agreement that
differences in math levels may be attributed to three factors:</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">•	The number of
skills that can be demonstrated</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">•	Levels achieved
on skills demonstrated, and 
</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">•	Nature or degree
of clustering of skills learned.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><br />

</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Grade levels in the
public-school system are established by Department of Education;
individual student proficiency levels are awarded by teachers. 
Levels in postsecondary institutions are set in the institution. 
This in spite of the fact that awarding levels is a regulatory and
not a teaching function.  Furthermore, in the public domain
regulatory functions are usually the responsibility of a separate
body.

<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Based on the
literature, the above noted discussions and the writer’s
experience, the writer concludes that:</p>
<ol>
	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">The transition
	issue cannot be solved by adjustments to the public-school system
	alone</p></li>

	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Cooperation
	among providers is hampered by the lack of agreed- upon definitions
	of a number of key concepts. 
	</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Broadly
	speaking, education lacks an overarching statement of philosophy and
