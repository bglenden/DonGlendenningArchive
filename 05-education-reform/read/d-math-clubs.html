  D  Math clubs
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Published March 27, 2014, Don observes the absence of math clubs in Canadian schools and proposes establishing them as community-based programs outside school hours, open to students from multiple schools. He notes UPEI&#x27;s mathematics team competes successfully in national competitions, suggesting student interest and potential exist. His proposal reflects belief in fostering intellectual curiosity and providing enrichment opportunities beyond standard curriculum. The letter demonstrates his vision of education extending beyond formal schooling into community engagement.</div>

<p>Dear Sir:</p>
<p><b>Math clubs</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>I had an enquiry recently about school math clubs; I checked a few school websites and did not find any.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In fact, I did a quick scan of school math clubs on the internet and found them to be rare in any Canadian school.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Neither did my scan of winners of the Canadian Math Olympiad, revealed Island names in recent years.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>UPEI does not have a club as such, however, they do have a Math Team that competes each year in the <span>William Lowell Putnam Mathematical Competition and last year placed in the top 25 percent.</span></p>
<p>The idea of math clubs should not be limited to schools; in fact, the suggestion was made that math clubs they should be held outside schools and school hours and accept boys and girls from any school.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If there was sufficient interest, competitions could be held across the Island or even in the Region.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We have competitions in sports why not for math.</p>
<p>If you have any interest in starting a math club let me know and I will put you in touch with others who are also interested.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
<p><br></p>
