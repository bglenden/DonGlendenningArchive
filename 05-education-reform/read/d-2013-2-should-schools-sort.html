  D 2013-2 Should schools sort
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Don distinguishes between formative testing (to improve learning) and summative testing (to rank and sort students), arguing these are fundamentally incompatible functions. He proposes separating teaching from ranking roles, analogous to how sports divide coaching from refereeing. His argument emphasizes that ranking inherently contradicts the teacher&#x27;s role of helping students learn, and this dual responsibility creates systemic unfairness. The position reflects Don&#x27;s systematic thinking about organizational roles and his commitment to pedagogically sound practices.</div>

<p>Dear Sir:</p>
<p><b>Teacher: Referee or coach?</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The role of a teacher is to help students learn.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A teacher helps a learner improve existing skills and learn new ones. At the end of each period, each day, each year, each student should “know” more than they did at the beginning.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Part of helping process involves feedback, gathering information through observation, practice or testing.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But the sole purpose of that testing is to design better learning activities; educators refer to it as formative testing.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>It is also useful to know how a student’s level of knowledge or skill compares with others; for this we have competitions.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This is known as summative or high stakes testing because the results are used to gain a qualification, determine entrance to further education, earn scholarships and awards, determine winners and losers or establish rankings.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Examples include PISA tests, Provincial exams, music competitions, the Canadian Math Olympiad,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Teaching and ranking are separate functions; teachers should neither be asked nor allowed to rank their own students - neither should schools. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In sports we have coaches and referees; education deserves the same.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Anything less is not fair to students.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
<p><br></p>
