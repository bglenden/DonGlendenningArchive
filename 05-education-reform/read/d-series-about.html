</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Compilation of draft letters titled &quot;D-23 Series&quot; on education reform. Don argues education has been &quot;overpowered by the influence of schools&quot; and defines education as experiences changing what people know, feel, believe, value, and can do. Emphasizes education&#x27;s role in six life roles. Critiques website focus on schooling rather than education. Uses analogy: improving the rink won&#x27;t improve your grandson&#x27;s hockey. Includes multiple draft variations and represents his core messaging on education versus schooling distinction.</div>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 108%"><b>Education
is important. It is a major factor in determining both our individual
and collective futures. It is said that we fill six life roles, that
of an individual, family member, student, citizen, consumer and
producer. Education helps us thrive in any and all these roles. Most
important, it gives us choices in our everyday living.  </b>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 108%"><b>So,
what is education? I consider education to be experiences that
changes what we know, what we can do, what we believe, what we value
and much more;  education experiences that change us are arranged by
parents, by teachers, but may be arranged by friends or even
experienced by accident. Our education is the result of the give and
take of all our experiences, not just those in school. </b>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 108%"><b>What
one learns in school is certainly part of one’s education; what

Editor:</b></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 108%"><b>The
World Bank is the world’s largest financial contributor to public
education. In an annual report some time ago, the Bank cautioned
developing countries about using “education and going school” as
though they are one and the same. Good advice.</b></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 108%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 108%"><b>Education
is an umbrella concept. It involves experiences that impact on what
we know, feel, value, do, believe and think. A school, on the other
hand, is a space or building designed, equipped, staffed and
organized to provide groups of learners with help. </b>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 108%"><b>A
school may be likened to a hospital where patients go for assistance
with health matters. Being hospitalized means that you are getting
help; getting out of the hospital suggests that you are on the mend
but not necessarily well.</b></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 108%"><br />

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 108%"><b>Dear
Editor:</b></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 108%"><b>There
have been some interesting items in the media recently about the
state of basic education; I’ve encountered similar comments in my
conversations. </b>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 108%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 108%"><b>Such
issues, I believe, arise in part, because our objectives are not
clear. References to “purpose” that I encounter in the PEI
literature refer to helping “Islanders find a meaningful place in
society”, “developing and delivering programs”, and helping 
people reach their dream. While all are positive none are
sufficiently clear as a basis for designing programs or assessing
progress.  </b>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 108%"><b>Purpose
and goals guide our activities, our organization, what we teach and
how we measure. As readers may know, New Brunswick has undertaken a
recent review of public education; one of their goals is that “every
child will leave Grade 5 having mastered the tools to learn –
reading, writing and numeracy.” PEI needs an equally clear
statement. It gives focus to curriculum development, assessment,
transcripts and report cards and the meaning of grade levels and
graduation. </b>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 108%"><b>Education
is complex; information plays a key role.  Learners have different
interests, experiences, capabilities and needs; learners also fill a
variety of life roles. Those who teach, or other-wise serve learners,
must be very clear in their communication. Conceptual clarity
heightens our understanding of key words and concepts; lack of
clarity is a significant issue for public education.  It must be
addressed directly so that the concept of education won’t become
diluted and potentially ineffective</b></p>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 108%"><b>.
Lack of clarity may arise form an idea itself, from the person
promoting the idea or from the person receiving the idea; Lack of
clarity could also signal conflicting ideas and levels of discomfort
or disagreement from within the education family group itself; some
say “clarity” is also related to self confidence.    Conceptual
clarify is also a must in planning and assessing performance. </b>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 108%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 108%"><b>I
first thought that the lack of clarity resulted from a style of
writing, an attempt to  be inclusive , an attempt to not leave out
important items, but I’ve changed my mind.  I now realize that I
comes from educational antiquity, from classifying education first as
elementary, secondary and higher rather than helping others gain
personal, citizenship or employment related experiences.  Going to
school is the focus rather than helping people change the way they
