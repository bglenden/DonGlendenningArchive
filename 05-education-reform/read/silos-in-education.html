  Silos in Education
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">This is a letter to the editor of The Guardian addressing educational silos. Don Glendenning explains how professional autonomy, government policies, and institutional monopolies create isolated systems. He references BC appointing a Superintendent of Reading and uses the farm silo metaphor to critique the system&#x27;s lock on education. The document discusses OECD research linking school autonomy to performance, noting direct relationships between school autonomy and student achievement in reading and resource allocation. Concludes by urging readers to contact MLAs about school autonomy while new regulations are being written.</div>

<p>Editor, The Guardian</p>
<p>Charlottetown, PEI</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Dear Sir:</p>
<p><b>Silos in Education</b></p>
<p>On a number of occasions over the past year or so, people currently active in education, have spoken about educational silos, meaning that there is little interaction among providers of educational services.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That conjures up a vision of educators, labouring in splendid isolation from each other and from the outside world.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It may be an unfair image but I believe that it includes more than a kernel of truth.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The silos, and the silo mentality, have emerged for a number of reasons:</p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li1">Professional educators, like other professionals, guard their freedom, and they have done it well.</li>
  <li class="li1">Government has contributed to the silo mentality by allowing, perhaps even supporting, the building of silos.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This is most evident in the case of reading which is offered ty or through the Department of Education, the Department of Innovation and Advanced Learning, the College, the University, employers and a number of other agencies as well.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My search so far has not revealed any of the providers with a mandate to coordinate efforts of all.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is interesting to note that BC, in its efforts to improve reading, has<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>has appointed a Superintendent of Reading</li>
  <li class="li1"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The sheer height and<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>profile of a silo, or bank of silos, my lead us to the view that it is the only, or even the best, food available for our cattle.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>While this is not my area of expertise that there ae many sources of nourishment not contained in the silo.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Whiich leads me to education.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Our school system has a lock on education.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We are<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>brainwashed that the only education that is important is provided by our educational institutions and educational institutions know the proper mix.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Their brand is the only brand that matters.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>moore widespread image <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That may be an unnfairWhen I hear this, my mid flips to the bank of silos on the farm where I grew upreferred to the fact that the system is I grew up on a traditional mixed farm on the Miramichi. Each time I return<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Im am struck by the changed silhoutteeWhen As I return to<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>my family As a follow-up to the discussion about PEI’s standing on PISA tests last year, readers may be interested to learn of a recent report from the OECD that shows a direct link between PISA test results and school autonomy; the article should also put to rest the debate over posting results. The information is especially timely given plans to change to a single board of Trustees.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Simply stated, there is a direct relationship between school performance and school autonomy.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In the words of the OECD Report:</p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li1">“In countries where schools have greater autonomy over what is taught and how students<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
</ul>
<p>are assessed, students tend to perform better.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li1">In countries where schools account for their results by posting achievement data publicly, schools that enjoy greater autonomy in resource allocation tend to show better student performance than those with less autonomy.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li1">In countries where there are no such accountability arrangements, schools with greater autonomy in resource allocation tend to perform worse.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p>Autonomy, or freedom to act, varies from country to country but may include such things as allocation of<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>resources, hiring and dismissing teachers, formulating budgets, decisions about curricula and assessment, course offerings and textbooks.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A quick scan of trustee roles reveals that, at least in Ontario and Alberta, trustees have much more decision making authority than Trustees on PEI. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>If you feel schools should have more autonomy, tell your MLA – and do it now while new regulations are being written. I’d also be interested in your views at standards2020@gmail.com</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Don Glendenning</p>
<p>A long-time student of education</p>
<p><br></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li1">Governments, on the other hand are responsible to the electorate, the community, to determine what they will/can fund; obviously, government should consult with both the public and with educators but the decision is theirs. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
</ul>
