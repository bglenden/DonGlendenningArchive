  2016  Education and schooling 
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Argues for distinguishing education from schooling, noting that departments of education often focus only on school-age children despite education being lifelong. Uses analogies (health vs. hospitalization, religion vs. church) to clarify the distinction. Advocates that this separation improves communication, expands learning opportunities, supports independent learning, and better accommodates personal skills like problem-solving and entrepreneurship.</div>

<p>We often confuse schooling and education; we do not similarly confuse health and hospitalization, religion with church attendance, farming and agriculture or citizenship with court appearances.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Seldom do we conclude that a person is healthy because they spent time in a hospital or are religious because they attend church, mosque or synagogue regularly. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Good’s Dictionary of Education defines education<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>as “the aggregate of all processes by means of which a person develops abilities, attitudes and other forms of behaviour of positive value in the society in which he lives.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Mine is simpler than that; I define education as any experience that has a formative effect on the way a person thinks feels or acts.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A functional analysis would show schooling, or more likely “instruction”, as one of the functions of an education system</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Schooling, on the other hand is described in Good’s dictionary as “individual training or education received in an educational institution, military or civilian.”;<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>again I define schooling that part of one’s education resulting from experiences planned and organized for a learner while in an educational institution.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This may be an appropriate time to pause and verbalize your own definition</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The website of the PEI Department of Education, Early Learning and Culture includes a <span>Philosophy of Education</span>; a quick read tells us that the Department’s focus is on children but only those children who are in or preparing for; the structure of the Department reflects the same view.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Based on Departmental documentation, a more accurate title would be Department of Public Instruction.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As a Department of education, documents would leave the impression that the other 100,000 Islanders, those who are not children, don’t need or warrant an educational service. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Although not as familiar with New Brunswick and Nova Scotia Education systems, their web sites suggests that the focus of those Departments is also on youngsters in school. In taking this position, let me hasten to say that I am aware the all three Provinces provide support to other educational activities through other Government Departments but none seem to have a philosophy of education as a whole.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Readers may well ask why the fuss is and whether or not it makes any difference; I believe that separating the two:</p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li4">Is more accurate and professionally honest</li>
  <li class="li4">Is required to put schooling in context</li>
  <li class="li4">Results in clearer communication among stakeholders.</li>
  <li class="li4">Expands our view of learning opportunities</li>
  <li class="li4">Would give more support to independent and lifelong learning</li>
  <li class="li4">Reduces the emphasis on traditional disciplines,</li>
  <li class="li4">Is more accommodating to the inclusion of personal skills such as self-reliance, problem solving, entrepreneurship and creativity.</li>
  <li class="li4">Helps clarify accountability/more measurable</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p>While all of us have a responsibility to be accurate in what we say, I believe that educators have a special responsibility.</p>
