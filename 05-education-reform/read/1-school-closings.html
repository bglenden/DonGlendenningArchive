  1 School Closings
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Glendenning proposes separating three distinct decisions conflated in school closure policies: building availability, resource accessibility (library, labs), and transportation safety. He argues schools should maintain regular schedules with individual teacher decisions about travel feasibility, and families deciding whether children attend. Rather than administrative convenience closures, students should decide to stay home based on personal circumstances. This reflects his philosophy that learning is individual, not collective, and that institutional policies should support individual choice rather than impose uniform solutions.</div>

<p><br></p>
<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>School closings</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>ln recent days, I have been part of several discussions about school closings. The most interesting was a</p>
<p>brief conversation with a stranger while waiting in line at a store. lt turns out that he was a teacher who</p>
<p>found his way to a store at 8.00 am but was upset because school opening was only delayed instead of</p>
<p>school being cancelled. He was not looking forward to the day; the students would not be in a good</p>
<p>mood; they also wanted/expected schools to be cancelled.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>School cancellation is based on a number of assumptions. One is that schooling and education are the</p>
<p>same; they're not. Schooling is an important part of education but it is only a part. A second assumption</p>
<p>is that groups learn; they don't. Only individuals learn although they may learn in a group setting. ln fact,</p>
<p>some things can best be learned with others; but certainly not all. Finally, we have assigned schools the</p>
<p>responsibility of, not only what takes in place in school, but also with transporting learners from their</p>
<p>homes to a school of our choice.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I would like to comment on three elements of the school- closing issue. First is the matter of the school</p>
<p>buildings and physical resources within them. A schedule of school and resource availability should be</p>
<p>established and maintained. Yes, there will be instances when a building may be closed because of</p>
<p>emergency situations but only in genuine emergencies. A snowfall and or high winds is not sufficient</p>
<p>reason, to my way of thinking, to close a school building unless it is felt that the structure is likely to</p>
<p>collapse causing danger to the people inside.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>A separate decision needs to be made about which resources within a school should be open to</p>
<p>students when numbers are small or teachers are absent. Most study areas including library/resource</p>
<p>centres, classrooms, and computer labs could be opened to most students most of the time; some study</p>
<p>areas may have to be restricted.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>With schools generally open, teachers will have to decide whether conditions allow them to reach their</p>
<p>place of work. lt is an individual decision. Teachers living nearby should have no problem; those living at</p>
<p>a distance from the school may miss some days. When teachers cannot keep to a schedule, they should</p>
<p>let their clients, the students, know. When a teacher accepts a teaching post, there is a contract to</p>
<p>provide a service and that contract should be honoured at all reasonable cost. A staffing policy may be</p>
<p>required to deal with teacher absences but closing a school so that a teacher gets paid should not be an</p>
<p>option.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>d et'.:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The Government provides opportunity, encouragement, teachers and other resources to assist students</p>
<p>to obtain a quality education but only learners can learn. lt is a responsibility of learners, or their</p>
<p>parents, to ensure that learners take advantage of the resources. Teachers certainly play a role in</p>
<p>motivating students" Students make individual decisions about if what, when, how and how much they</p>
<p>learn; even when we are teaching, learners may be learning something quite different from what is</p>
<p>intended"</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>As for transportation, there are at last two separate points of decision-making. People providing the bus</p>
<p>service, or the operators themselves, should decide whether or not it is safe to drive. lf conditions are</p>
<p>unsafe, buses should stay off the road and students along the route should be informed of the change of</p>
<p>plans. Even when buses are operating, parents are the ones to decide each day whether or not their</p>
<p>child gets on the bus. lf bus transportation is not available, a parent may arrange alternative</p>
<p>transportation if they know the school is open.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Frequently I am asked if the above policies will not result in some students being ahead or behind others</p>
<p>and if the gap will widen. This implies that students in the same grade are at the same level of</p>
<p>achievement and move forward in a lock-step fashion. This is far from the case. ln any class, some</p>
<p>students are ahead and others behind the average - whatever average means. The system copes with</p>
<p>students who lose a day due to illness, why can't it also cope with a student who loses a day due to bad</p>
<p>weather? Granted the number of absentees may be larger on a storm day, but the problem remains</p>
<p>essentially the same.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Closing schools on stormy days is administratively convenient but I believe is disruptive to students and</p>
<p>learning. The decision to attend or not attend on any given day belongs to the student and/or parents. I</p>
<p>am quite satisfied that teachers are both willing and able to deal with school absences in a less</p>
<p>disruptive fashion. .</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
