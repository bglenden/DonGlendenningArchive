  2015 Basic documents
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Don critiques PEI&#x27;s Department of Education Philosophy document for being narrowly focused on schooling rather than education, fuzzy in language, and lacking measurable goals. He argues that important learning happens outside institutional settings and that education should encompass online courses, workplace training, and home-based learning. Don recommends that updating this foundational document should be &quot;Job 1&quot; for a new Premier, reflecting his belief that clarity of purpose precedes effective implementation. This letter showcases his demand for philosophical clarity and systemic coherence.</div>

<p>Editor,</p>
<p>Charlottetown Guardian</p>
<p>Charlottetown, PEI	</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Dear Sir:</p>
<p><b>Time to update basic education documents<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Every Islander who is interested in education should take a look at the “Philosophy of Education” found on the website of the Department of Education and Early Childhood Development. It’s a short document about purposes, basic principles, goals and the role of schools in society.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It’s a basic document and one that reflects the beliefs and values and of the psople who operate our schools.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The document also helps understand the basis for decision making; it’s a useful document but it needs to be updated, refreshed and broadened.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>WI say this because:</p>
<p>It purports to be about education but is only about schooling.</p>
<p>It is a fuzzy document</p>
<p>Most goals are not measurable</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>GoalsBecause hy do I say this:beliMany of our important learning experiences occur outside school our Institutions (schools, colleges and universities); in fact, increasingly one hears of employers givimg increased weight to non-school experience in theirmhirinh prsctices.frequently encounter articles th there are education needs that can be met through on line courses, self study, workplace training, in the home and elsewhere needs, needs that can be met through on line courseare an Important co but, by themselves, are not the education system.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>mponnent of an education systemA school system is one component of a</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I am not suggesting a million dollar study such as the recent one in done in Nova Scotia; on the other hand it updating should<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>be more than a simple rewrite of the existing philosophy with a new pen.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The development of a philosophy of all education should be “Job 1” for the new Premier.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A clear unambiguous statement of beliefs by itself would make a significant contribution to improving our education.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
<p><br></p>
