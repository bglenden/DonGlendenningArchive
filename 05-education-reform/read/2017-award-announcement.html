Education
20/20 will offer an award to a PEI school or early learning centre
again next year.  Earlier awards focused on engagement by the school
and community in
the daily operation of the school; the 2016 award will focus on the
nature and extent to which technology is used to enhance learning and
teaching.  The award, $2,500, may be used for any purpose.  The
Excellence in Education Award is open to a school or learning center
operating at the K-12 level.  The focus on technology was chosen, in
part, to recognize the commitment by the Province to provide an
additional $4m to upgrade technology in PEI schools in the coming
years.</p>

In
announcing the Award, Dr. Glendenning, President of Education 20/20
thanked Dr. Regis and Joan Duffy for their continuing interest in and
support for education in PEI.  The 2014 award went to Kinkora
Regional High School and the award money, in the words of Jaime Cole,
Principal, “was used to make the school a more comfortable
environment for the students to learn.”  The 2015 Award went to the
Prince Street Elementary School.

“Schools
use technology in a variety of way depending on the school’s
philosophy”,
said Glendenning”and it will be interesting to see the particular
applications presented by schools.”  Technology has a variety of
applications; some teachers may use it to replace their own lectures
even as an “upside down classroom” where students use technology
as homework and class time for internalizing and massaging what has
been learned; others may use it to broaden a course or program or as
an aid to diagnosing and assessing a student’s level of
achievement.  When reviewing nominations, the reviewing committee
will consider the ease of access by students, relevance
to curriculum outcomes, and the level of engagement by students,
teachers and the community.  “I’m sure that there will also be
some new applications”, said Glendenning.
