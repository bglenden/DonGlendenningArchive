  D 2013-Failure
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">A lengthy, exploratory draft examining whether schools should teach students to deal with failure. Don distinguishes between failure as a life experience and schools&#x27; instructional role. He argues that test results are diagnostic information for teaching improvement (formative), not measures of student failure. He critiques schools taking on ranking functions alongside teaching, proposing three metaphors: sport (with coaching and umpiring), race (with judges), and journey (with guides). This philosophical piece reflects Don&#x27;s mature thinking about systemic purposes and the distinction between learning support and competitive ranking.</div>

<p>Dear Sir:</p>
<p><b>Failure in school</b></p>
<p><b>Should schools teach students how to fail?</b></p>
<p>The matter of student failure has come up in a number of recent discussions; there is a general view that failure happens to all of us, we need to learn how to deal with it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Failure in school is an acceptable experience, perhaps even a desirable one.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The role of teachers is to help others learn. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As part of the teaching process, teachers test students to find out what they‘ve learned.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Test results may show the student has learned<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>a lot or a little;<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>not having learned has many causes; it’s a diagnosis and you cannot fail a diagnosis.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Based on test results, teachers teach again taking the test results into account and, hopefully, the results will be satisfactory.</p>
<p>But we’ve asked our schools to do something else, to sort their students – to identify who gets prizes and diplomas – and who doesn’t.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>What was intended as an aid to teaching has become a sorting process, a process that has nothing to do with teaching.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The guide and advocate has now become a judge and the teacher is no longerthe best, whatever that means, name the best, which ajtomatically identifies the poorest.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>something</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>design new strategies based on test results. Teachers to help our sons and daughters learn; part of the teaching process involves testing how much we’ve learned so that we can des</p>
<p><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Analogies never quite fit but here are three possibilities; schooling as a:</p>
<p>Sport, with a teacher setting the rules, coaching and acting as umpire.</p>
<p>Race, with teacher acting as the judge who determines the winner. `</p>
<p>Journey, with teacher as tour planner and guide helping travellers what ever their destination, their resources or time available.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Society requires that all students attend school and spends huge amounts of money to ensure that schooling is easily accessible to all, especially its young people,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Parents want their child to have an even better than they have, they also know<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Not only must they learn certain useful skills, knowledge and patterns of behaviour, they need a coveted “folded paper” to prove it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Some time later, perhaps even months or years, students and parents learn that their child is not meeting expectations, that he or she is failing to develop an important skill such as reading, or to meet the xpected level of performance for<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>a course, a grade or even the whole school experience.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>What happens next, or should happen next, depends on your view of schools.</p>
<p>The school is saying that<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>we have done everything that we can<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>do; you are on your own</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>There is nothing more that can be done to help your child learn the things that we both believe to be important</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>that they need help with the task and teachers are there to help.know that what’s taught in schools is important to their child’s future, so they send their children to sch</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>, and as parents, we make huge investments in providing Our children go to school to learn; At this point, I’m simply trying to sort out my own thinking.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Let me Friends tell me that young people, students in particular, need to learn to deal with failure.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The comment usually comes up in the course of conversations about schooling, and in particular about standards and social promotion.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I understand what’s being said, but the role of our schools in dealing with failure is still very murky, at least in my mind.</p>
<p>So, I look for or try to create a working definition.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A quick browse of the internet soon reveals such phrases as not achieving the desired end, falling short and non-performance of what is requested or expected.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This is helpful but, in the case of education, I am still left with questions about the desired end, whose expectations, and how the shortfall is determined.</p>
<p>I am not arguing against the lessons to be learned from failure; my concern is only about the role of schools and teachers.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Is failure a legitimate school activity?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Does failure belong in schools or should it be shared by other teaching agencies, the church, sports for example?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>What role, if any, should a school play in creating activities that result in failure?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Should schools create circumstances where significant numbers of students are likely to fail?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Or is the role of a school to help students deal with the impact of failures that may occur in their lives?</p>
<p>One of the obvious contributors to failure is the tyranny of time (Readers may recall my letter on this subject in this newspaper shortly before Christmas); we might be amazed at the reduction in the failure rate by simply giving students more time to learn.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>After all, learning is a journey, or perhaps a destination, not a race.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Reaching the destination is the objective not how far you travel each day. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>I’m still exploring the subject and would be delighted to talk further over a cup of coffee.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You may issue an invitation or state your views at<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>HYPERLINK "mailto:standards2020@gmail.com" <span>standards2020@gmail.com</span><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
