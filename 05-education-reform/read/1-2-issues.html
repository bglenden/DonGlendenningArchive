<p>Dear Editor:</p>
<p>Improving education<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>- DRAFT 1-2 Issues</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>On most week day mornings, nearly 20,000 young Islanders trundle off, or are trundled off, to public school; it is a rite of passage intended to provide foundation knowledge, attitudes and skills for later life. No one seriously questions the need for such an investment in the education of our youth but many wonder if the system now in place meets this objective.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Explain what school means</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>For some time now I have engaged with Islanders in conversations about our education system, with<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>students about their learning paths, residents of Souris about continuing education, Islanders interested in<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>math, officials bout need for n educational taxonomy, politiciiiiannns reluctance to experiment, employers about entry level wkillsand the fear factor.</p>
<p>Professional autonomy</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Conversations reveal both an interest and frustration with the subject,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>a shortage of information and dialogue, fixation on credit, seat time, assessment and grades, the existence of<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>silos,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>inability or unwillingness to personalizunwillingness to recognize the difference beterrin educstion aand instruction, lck of autonomy and accountabilitye, n t</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>hat helps individual Islanders develop skills needed to thrive in their various life roles; my search als the emphasis ob instruction may foster depency instead. Islanders worry about the emphasis on cognitive skills, education, about levels of basic and work entry skills, and about soft skills like self- management and working with others.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Raising literacy and numeracy scores by even one grade, I am told, would make a noticeable impact on productivity.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Education on PEI is fragmented, bureaucratic and isolated from the community it serves; many say it is also politicized.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Instruction should focus on development of young<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>islanders rather than delivery of programs to schools.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Governments cannot be faulted for the systems transferred to their care; once in control, however, each government has a responsibility to do the best it can, in this case, closing the gap between what we have and what we want by way of education services.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>An overhaul of education is in order at this time; we especially need<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>{1} a clear statement of overarching beliefs and guiding principles (2) a range of services configured to serve both individuals and communities in which they live, and (3) a delivery system that is both effective and efficient. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I suggest an in-house review led by members now in leadership positions supplemented by some public members and extra specialists as needed: not only would it give a new sense of direction, it would be a great staff development activity as well.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I had planned this letter to precede an election call; obviously I miscalculated. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I am not sure how many candidates will ring my doorbell but, those who do, should expect questions about the above proposal.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Whether or not you agree with my view, I recommend that you raise the eduction with politicians who stip t your door.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Don Glendenning, A long time student of education</p>
