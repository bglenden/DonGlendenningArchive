  2016-6 Student grading 
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Don argues that postsecondary institutions and employers should abandon blanket &quot;high school graduation&quot; entrance requirements in favor of specific skill requirements (communication, algebra, etc.). He identifies grading as a regulatory, not teaching function, noting that teachers certifying achievement while teaching creates conflict of interest. He advocates separating teaching and sorting roles—as done in sports (coaches vs. referees) and professional credentialing—and proposes creating an independent qualification authority to measure and certify achievement levels, improving consistency and reducing teacher workload.</div>

<p>Dear Editor:</p>
<p>School grading: a regulatory function</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>It’s time for postsecondary institutions to drop high school graduation from their list of entrance requirements; the same may be said for employers. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A requirement worded that broadly is not very predictive but also presents a barrier to change in our public school system; according to The Vancouver Sun of May 24, 2016, the University of British Columbia only asks for results of English courses when students apply, but the University plans to replace even that requirement next year with their own test of literacy.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I am not arguing that high school studies and records be ignored but rather that the requested information be more specific i.e. strong communication skills, some algebra, etc.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>A functional analysis of teaching shows that grading students (sorting) is not a teaching function; under current arrangements, however, teachers are required to certify that “students have achieved certain levels of performance”.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It’s time to separate the functions; that step alone, will likely reduce grading inconsistencies..<span class="Apple-converted-space">     </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Establishing grades is a regulatory function and should not be confused with testing for the purpose of diagnosing learning needs.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Teaching and sorting are separate roles; we separate those functions in other areas of endeavour, so should we in education.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Coaches and referees are separate in sports; separate also are those who train from those who certify professionals. Maybe the separation of roles is what the new PEI Education Act intends when it includes “school grades” under the role of principals. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>It may even be time to remove the grading function entirely from the education system and let teachers focus on teaching. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>One alternative is to create an independent qualification authority whose sole role would be to measure and certify levels of achievement.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Having an independent testing service would, I believe, improve consistency of results, reduce teacher workload and minimize cheating, and probability improve system flexibility</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Such a move raises questions about which parts of education need to be regulated, but that question must wait for another letter.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
