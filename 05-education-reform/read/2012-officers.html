<b>Education 2020: Quality
Education for All</b></p>
<p align="center" style="margin-bottom: 0.14in"><b>June
22, 2013 'Visioning’ Workshop</b></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in"><b>Participants: </b>Eileen
Conway-Martin, Owen Parkhouse, Don Glendenning, Alice Taylor,
Bernadette Allen, and Norman Finlayson 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in"><b>Objectives: (1) </b> to
discuss/confirm Education 2020’s broad vision and purpose; (2)
review progress to date; and (3)  identify further practical steps to
take to move organization toward vision and purpose. 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in"><b>Exercise # 1 </b>– Imagining
Success for Education 2020 <b> </b>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in"><b>Question explored:</b> Imagine
that it is the year 2020 (seven years into the future) and PEI's
approach to learning and education has successfully transformed
itself; what would this success look like to you? 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in"><b>Brief Summary of Participants
Vision of Success </b>
</p>
<p align="center" style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">“<i><b>education is
not a means to an end….because there should be no end to education”
(Owen P)</b></i></p>
<ul>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">A culture of learning is more
	accepted and gaining prominence – nurturing and supporting
	learning is the norm, and it is a life-long journey.  
	</p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">This culture of learning
	includes, and is integrated with community; communities are integral
	to this focus – and are well engaged. 
	</p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">Education is learner-centred
	not teacher centred – the focus is nurturing and supporting the
	individual’s capacity to learn, to explore and to grow.</p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">The learner-centred focus is
	embedded in all aspects of the learning curriculum and teaching
	methodologies.  
	</p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">The awareness of, and focus on,
	social-emotional needs and growth has equal value with such markers
	as literacy and numeracy (especially in the early years).  The whole
	person is considered and supported; the process will include the
	learning needs and styles of the whole person. 
	</p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">The learner mentorship
	concept/model is in place – this role is both recognized and
	integrated with the learning process – especially during certain
	development stages (apprenticeship).</p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">That learning is happening, can
	happen, in all types of situation and study/social environments;
	e.g. learning circles, book clubs, music groups, seniors’ college,
	etc. 
	</p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">The learner is provided with
	all types of opportunities to apply concepts, theories, and
	perspectives within context of real life. 
	</p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">That learning is a 24/7
	activity/process is recognized and accepted. 
	</p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">The focus is on establishing
	and supporting good learning processes – and then positive results
	and outcomes will follow.  Need to have a good learning process to
	ensure good outcomes are achieved.</p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">There are well-established
	‘networks of learning’ in place; these could be both local and
	global, and could take the form of ongoing institutes, annual
	conferences to share best practices. New social media and
	communication tools make ‘global learning modules’ possible. 
	</p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">There is a high value placed on
	evaluation – in the context of continuous improvement. 
	</p></li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in"><b>Is it possible to ‘tease out’
a crisp/succinct vision and mission statements from above images of
success?   </b>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in"><b>Objective # 2 - Exercise</b></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">Given that Education 2020 as a
concept has been ‘on the go’ for a year or more, what has been
achieved to date? What are the elements that can be leveraged to move
forward?</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in"><b>Achievements to Date </b>
</p>
<ul>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">There is a emerging/growing
	group of individuals with a shared philosophy.</p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">There is a wide range and
	diverse level of support through the broader community (e.g. regular
	Islanders, community leaders, employers, educators, government
	policy/program people, etc) (Note: Don has a list of those he has
	consulted with/talked to, and who have expressed interest and
	support).  
	</p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">There is a better understanding
	of barriers and challenges to be faced in transforming from
	education/schooling to learning.</p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">There has been a series of
	‘public discussion’ type sessions to explore perceptions,
	direction and focus re learning.  
	</p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">Education 2020 has been
	incorporated, letterhead has been developed, beginning efforts re a
	website are at work; there is a plan in place to celebrate success
	re local ‘best practice’ re innovative learning through an
	Awards Event. 
	</p></li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in"><b>Objective # 3 – What is the ‘Go
Forward’ Plan?</b></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">Given the success indicators
described, what are the issues that must begin to be addressed in
order to move 'down the path of success'? 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in"><b>The following elements/pieces of
work still need to be completed.</b></p>
<ul>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">Establish Education 2020’s
	broader vision and goal(s) 
	</p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">Develop a one-pager to document
	and describe this vision 
	</p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">Establish and communicate the
	core elements and values of Education 2020</p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">Explore what other similar
	groups are doing – how are they approaching the ‘transformational
	change process’  
	</p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">Then a launch of the initiative
	– and event, expo, awards, etc. 
	</p></li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in"><b>Considerations and needs in terms
of going forward </b>
</p>
<ul>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">Need a researcher – someone
	to do the legwork in going forward</p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">Where to get resources –
	Foundations, individual supporters, McCain Foundation??  
	</p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">Need to ensure that the project
	is ‘framed’ and communicated as doing something NEW – e.g.  a
	different view and approach to learning, aimed at engaging learners,
	communities, employers, etc – it is not an exercise in
	reviewing/addressing the current education systems’ needs and
	issues. 
	</p></li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in"><b>Next steps</b></p>
<ul>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">Confirm vision, beliefs and
	values – develop a draft one-pager – Don and Own have agreed to
	work on this (Don already has some written notes around this).</p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">Research other similar
	movements and models re approaches (Bernadette and Eileen have
	agreed to work on this)</p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">Complete website design work
	(Tom??? and ???) – build in interactive capacity</p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">Look for $$$$ to hire
	researcher person to do the ‘leg work’ – need to develop a
	‘job description’ for the research position 
	</p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">Set up an electronic repository
	site to house all relevant documents for the initiative and the team
		</p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">Develop and implement a
	communication strategy 
	</p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">Follow through on next steps re
	the Award event – a lot of planning has already gone into this
	activity 
	</p></li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in"><b>Other points and questions that
got raised – and useful to keep on the ‘Education 2020  list’</b></p>
<ul>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">Explore - learn from other
	similar movements “Mad in America” – “Competency Works’ 
	</p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">Have we defined things enough –
	e.g. learner-centred – what are the key elements or values that
	make it a learner-centred process?  
	</p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">Use of community-engagement
	software – engage discussion around  question re need for
	employment skills 
	</p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">Are teachers coaches or
	referees – is their essential role clear?</p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">Perception of students re
	teacher role – the referee focus may be stultifying natural
	student creativity and growth  
	</p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">Too much focus on getting the
	student to university 
	</p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">Differentiation between
	education and schooling – big problem 
	</p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">Need to have plain language re
	communications of learning and learner-centred concepts 
	</p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">Including in elements of choice
	in education – this would help to address the issue of evaluation 
	</p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">Have put too much re learning
	inside schools – this needs to change – e.g. guidance, etc –
	need to allow community a much larger role in assisting and
	supporting the learning process 
	</p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">Value and critical function of
	community learning needs to be more strongly acknowledged 
	</p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">A community-based educational
	facilitator role/function needs to be integrated into the process -
	to support all ages re learning</p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">Need to consider the ‘whole
	person’ re the learning process; an integrated system that
	supports the whole learner 
	</p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">There is room for more liberal
	arts education 
	</p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">Employers need to start hiring
	people for what they do 
	</p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">Working with kids with issues –
	what can we do that will make you want to be here? (in school –
	engaged in the learning process) 
	</p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">Current education system –
	not developed around a concept of what you have learned or achieved
	after a series of certain interventions – not a vision of the end
	product 
	</p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">Outcome – criteria re
	performance standards – need the starting point 
	</p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">Should the state be the leader
	in education? 
	</p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">Room for virtual
	schools/modules  – modular schools – don’t need the
	traditional ‘box’ structure 
	</p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">An education 20/20 launch at
	some point soon??</p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">A UPEI Summer Institute 2014
	type of conference event 
	</p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">Call for submissions re Award –
	innovative thinkers – doers
