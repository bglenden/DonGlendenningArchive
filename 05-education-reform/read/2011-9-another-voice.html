  2011-9 Another voice
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Don proposes creating stand-alone educational organizations modeled on independent health advocacy groups (Heart and Stroke Foundation, Diabetes Association). He specifically advocates for a reading improvement association operating independently from schools but in collaboration with them. Such organizations could provide public awareness, early detection support, research promotion, service lobbying, information clearinghouses, and policy influence. Open membership would include teachers, parents, employers, and community members. Don envisions these as complementing institutional support, extending reach beyond schools to libraries, workplaces, and homes.</div>

<p>Dear Editor:</p>
<p><b>Another Voice in Education</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The field of health has many voices. Some are associated with hospitals or other health care</p>
<p>institutions; others are, what I call, stand-alone organizations that, while working with</p>
<p>institutions, have a broader agenda. ln the latter category, I think of the Heart and Stroke</p>
<p>Foundation, Canadian Diabetes Association, Canadian Cancer Society, and many others. The</p>
<p>latter provide information and support but are not focused on support for people in the</p>
<p>hospital. Educational organizations, on the other hand, operate in support of schools, The PEI</p>
<p>Home and School Association being the best example.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Both kinds of organizations are needed but, at least in education, I like to see more of the stand-</p>
<p>alone variety. l'd start with an association focused on the improvement of reading, wherever it</p>
<p>occurs, in schools, libraries, workplace or home. One could also make the case for citizenship</p>
<p>and consumers.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Operating like those in the health field, such an organization could:</p>
<p>Support the efforts of others working in the field</p>
<p>Help raise public awareness of the importance of reading proficiency</p>
<p>Encourage early detection of reading difficulties</p>
<p>Stimulate and promote research</p>
<p>Lobby for special services</p>
<p>Act as a clearing house for information on the improvement of reading skills, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>lnfluence public policy in support of improved reading</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Membership should be open to anyone with an interest in improving the level of reading among</p>
<p>lslanders of all ages and include teachers, parents, employers and others. Although we need</p>
<p>discussions at the local level, a provincial umbrella organization may well be required to provide</p>
<p>support. i</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I believe that free-standing and unaligned health organizations make significant contributions to</p>
<p>our health; l'd like to see similar organizations in support of education. Drop a note at standards2020@gmail.com and let me know what you think.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
