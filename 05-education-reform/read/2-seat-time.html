  2 Seat time
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Letter to editor critiquing the use of &quot;seat time&quot; as a proxy for educational achievement. Don argues that since people learn at different rates, grade levels should either set achievement targets with flexible time requirements or report achieved levels within available time—not conflate attendance with learning. He notes teachers observe students with same-age peers yet four-to-five years behind in achievement. Don advocates for independent qualification authorities (as in most developed nations) to handle grading/certification, removing this responsibility from teachers. This reflects his consistent position separating teaching from assessment functions.</div>

<p><b>Dear Editor:</b></p>
<p><b>SEAT TIME AS A MEASURE OF EDUCATION</b></p>
<p><b>Seat time</b></p>
<p><b>We know that people learn at different rates; why then do we continue to use seat -time as a proxy for achievement?</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Grade levels are an administrative arrangement to track student and teacher progress, like<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>the length of stay in the hospital. In themselves they point to what has been taught rather than what has been learned. Teachers have pointed out students who, although the same age as classmates, are four or five years behind in achievement level.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Basing grades on seat time puts our credibility in question; we should either set levels and adjust the time needed for learners to reach them or (2) simply report level reached in the time available. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>From my perspective, grading is a regulatory function and should not be part of the role of those who tech, most developed countries have move to independent qualification authorities; so should Canada.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Sincerely</b></p>
