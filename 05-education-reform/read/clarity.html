  Clarity  -
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Don questions the contradictions in the Department of Education&#x27;s terminology and mandate. He notes that the department includes &quot;Lifelong Learning&quot; and &quot;Early Childhood Development&quot; in its title despite education already encompassing both. More critically, he discovered that the official Education Act no longer contains a definition of &quot;education,&quot; replacing it instead with &quot;school.&quot; This shift reflects a narrowing of the department&#x27;s conceptual scope from education (a broad service) to schooling (institutional focus). Don advocates for the department to document and share its current taxonomy of key terms, arguing that clarity in language is essential to understanding government&#x27;s educational mission and public accountability.</div>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 108%">Dear
Editor</p>
<p align="center" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 108%"><b>A
CALL FOR CLARITY</b></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 108%">											</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 108%">For
some time now, people have mentioned the fact that the Department of
Education has included ”Lifelong learning or Early Childhood
Development” in the official name even though education already
covers both. 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 108%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 108%">I
must admit my surprise, however, to learn recently that the
definition of “education” itself had been dropped from the
Education Act. My information is that “education” was replaced
with “school”. On checking, I find that role of the Department is
focused of “developing and delivering curriculum.” rather than on
the broader concept of education.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 108%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 108%">I
know that the World Bank has cautioned developing countries about
confusing “going to school” with” getting an education”. I
also know that the OECD and the Montreal Economic Institute favour
increased school autonomy.  But neither should be at the expense of
education.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 108%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 108%">The
Department plays an important role in public education. It is
important, therefore that we know the meaning that they apply to
words.   Perhaps the Department could document and share its current
taxonomy of key words.
