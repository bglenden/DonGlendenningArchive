  Duffy, Regis 1
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">This December 17, 2012 letter thanks Regis Duffy for supporting Education 20/20 Inc.&#x27;s education reform efforts. Don outlines the organization&#x27;s progress: successful small-group meetings, federal incorporation, upcoming charitable status, and multiple initiatives including early childhood development workshops, school-community engagement assessment, an education excellence award, dialogue with educators on reading skills, and plans to publish educational materials. The letter demonstrates that Education 20/20 had moved from exploratory phase to operational organization with concrete programs. Duffy is being solicited for ongoing financial support, and the letter invites him to an educational workshop in Stratford. This shows Don&#x27;s fundraising and donor cultivation skills.</div>
