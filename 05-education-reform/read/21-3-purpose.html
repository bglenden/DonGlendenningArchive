  21-3 Purpose
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Essay defining education as process helping others develop or change skills, knowledge, and attitudes—an umbrella term encompassing all learning wherever, whenever initiated. Don emphasizes community investment in education for individual and collective benefit through encouragement, regulation, attendance monitoring, and financial support. Lists long-time concerns including government capture of education (embedment, licensing, pay scales, professional/culture conflicts), measuring education by school time, absent program context, shift from service to product, client accountability absence, unclear standards/assessment, and professional status decline relative to health sector. Advocates for clear departmental education definition and invokes John Dewey&#x27;s maxim that knowing what someone believes is fundamental.</div>

<p><b>Dear Editor</b></p>
<p><b>Why we invest in education<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p>21-3</p>
<p>I think of education as a process of helping others develop or change skills, knowledge and attitudes. It’s an umbrella term and includes all learning experiences wherever, whenever and however initiated and carried out. Some of the most important learning happens in the first few years of life and is promoted and led by home and family.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Communities believe that education is good for the community as well as for individual citizens; through<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>government, they(1) encourage<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>citizens (2) regulate education matters (2) monitor school attendance by the young and (3) they provide financial support<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>As a long-time participant and observer of the education scene, the writer is concerned about:</p>

  <li class="li1"><span>Government capture of public education<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span></span>Embedment , licensing, pay scales.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>role of professional conflict of cultures, delegation</li>

<p>The second have of the I raise this issue at this time because I think it important, I have not found a definition in literature from our Department and I have encountered people who believe that going to school and getting an education are one and the same. Some Provinces have standard definitions; that would help.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Is i21-3</p>
<p>t a possible project for the Council of Atlantic Ministers of Education and Training?</p>
<p>John Dewey once said that if he could only know only one thing about a person, he’d like to know what that person believes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Given that the Department of Education plays such a key role in education in this Province, it would be helpful to know what the Department believes education to be.</p>

<p>My plea to our government is simple. what is the educational purpose for the millions of dollars contributed each year to education. As you will realize from my earlier writing, I do not consider running schools as an educational function.</p>
