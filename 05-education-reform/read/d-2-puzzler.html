  D 2 Puzzler
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">A letter from 2018 (included in 2023 file collection, indicating Don&#x27;s archival organization) framing education system structure as a &quot;puzzler&quot; (things he doesn&#x27;t understand). Don observes that most PEI government departments structure by field/branch: Agriculture (land, crops, potatoes), Health (COVID, drugs, e-health, hospitals), Fisheries (fishing, hunting, wildlife, trapping). Education, however, organizes by study levels (elementary, secondary, postsecondary), a notably different structural criterion. Don proposes alternative organizing principles: essential/occupational skills (welding, arts, science, technology), or life roles (citizen, individual, family member, student, producer, consumer). He uses a culinary metaphor—focus on the menu (educational services) rather than the dining room (schools)—suggesting that top leadership in Department and schools should focus on educational services, not school operation. This early articulation of structural critique demonstrates the consistency of Don&#x27;s thinking over years.</div>

<p>Editor,</p>
<p>Charlottetown, PEI	</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Dear Sir:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><b>An education puzzler</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>A friend has a habit of referring to something that he does not understand as “a puzzler.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My puzzler is about the structure of public education.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>A recent scan of PEI Government website shows that Departments are usually structured around branches or fields of endeavor. Agriculture includes land, crops and potatoes; Health reflects Covid, drugs, E-Health and hospitals; Fisheries includes fishing, hunting wild life and trapping.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Education, on the other hand, is organized around levels of study – elementary, secondary and postsecondary. Quite a different set of criteria.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I’d be interested in knowing why.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The focus of the Department of Education should be on helping Islanders improve and increase their level of essential skills, occupational skills, learning how to care for themselves and make a living-<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>- arts, science, technology, language, welding, etc.; another would be to organize round life roles - citizen, individual family member, student, producer and consumer And a host of other things. School, like hospitals, are simply places where education occurs. In culinary terms, we should focus on the menu rather than the dining room.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The top echelon in both the Department and schools should focus on educational services not the running of schools</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Sincerely<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
