<div class="reader-summary">This document appears to be the calibrating educational achievement letter (File 11) with an incorrect filename containing &quot;medical officer.&quot; It contains identical content about grading, assessment, the learning path concept, and the need for independent qualification authorities. The misfiled title suggests an incomplete file management process during batch extraction.</div>

<p>Editor,</p>
<p>Charlottetown Guardian</p>
<p>Charlottetown, PEI	</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Dear Sir:</p>
<p><b>Chief educational officer</b></p>
<p>The practice of grading students is thought to have originated at Yale in the late 1700’s and, in spite of being described in 1913 as “an absolutely uncalibrated instrument”, grades remain a significant component in determining the future of so many young lives. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Although I’ve had concerns about the issue for some time, problems with grading became much clearer when Education 20/20 plotted a “Learning Path.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>(A description of the Leaning Path” may be found in Occasional Paper No. 4 at<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>HYPERLINK "http://www.education2020.ca" <span>www.education2020.ca</span>). The process was most revealing and confirmed my belief that:</p>
<p>Formative assessment is a diagnostic function; it is an important part of the teaching process and provides teachers with valuable information to help students along the learning path.</p>
<p>Summative assessment is a sorting function, it is form of certifying a person’s level of achievement in a field or on a subject; it’s an official declaration of how far you travelled up the mountain.</p>
<p>For teachers to participate in ranking and grading students constitutes a conflict of interest.</p>
<p>PEI needs an independent body to establish standards for each subject and a separate body to manage it.</p>
<p>Diplomas and degrees are marketing tools of teaching institutions and should not be confused with describing a person’s level of education</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>We need a better way to both describe and measure progress along the learning path.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Don Glendenning</p>
<p>A long-time student of education</p>
