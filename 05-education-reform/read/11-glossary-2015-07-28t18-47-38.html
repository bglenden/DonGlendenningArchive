<p><b>GLOSSARY &amp; DEFINITIONS</b></p>

<p>Assessor			is a person designated to assess a person’s performance.</p>
<p>Benchmark 			is a level of performance which is widely recognized by practitioners or the public at large and which serves as the reference against which others are evaluated.</p>
<p>CBE				Competency Based Education (CBE) is an approach to organizing and delivering training or education which starts with the identification of the applications of knowledge to be demonstrated by a learner.</p>
<p>Certification 			is the issuance of a formal document which attests to the<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>capabilities of the holder based upon a selected sample of performance.</p>
<p><b>Competence		</b>the ability to meet performance requirement: <span>the ability to meet</span></p>
<p>the performance requirements of an occupation, trade or profession.</p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Competencies and Learning Outcomes</b></p>
<p>Competencies and learning outcomes are two related educational terms that can create confusion. Competencies and outcomes can be written to describe the learning gained by students in individual courses (course outcomes) or for the program as a whole (program outcomes). They DO NOT mean the same thing. We will follow the lead of<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>HYPERLINK "http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1541-4329.2004.tb00047.x/pdf" <span>Hartel and Foegeding (2004)</span> and use the following working definitions:</p>
<p><b>Competencies</b> commonly define the applied skills and knowledge that enable people to successfully perform in professional, educational, and other life contexts.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>

</p>
<p><span>Criteria</span> are indicators used to judge the extent or level of performance. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><b>Diploma: </b>according to Wikipedia, is of Greek origin meaning a "folded paper", and is a document issued by an educational institution indicating that the holder has completed a certain programme of studies</p>

<p><b>Grade level –</b>a group of students in a school classified by age or level of performance<b>; </b>A degree or a step in a scale: A step or degree in a process; A single division of a school classified by the age or progress of the pupils</p>
<p><b>Instruct </b>– furnish with information in a methodical way</p>
<p><b>Key Distinction</b>. The term learning outcome is used more commonly in the context of a program or course of instruction. The term competency is more commonly used in relation to professional fields (i.e. dentistry, nursing).</p>

<p><b>Learning domains – Cognitive, affective and psychomotor</b><b></b></p>
<p><b>Learning outcome </b>is written so that it can be measured or assessed. It focuses on what the student is able to do at end of a program (or course). Thus, learning outcomes are the basis for an assessment program that focuses on what a student can or should be able to do either upon completion of a course or upon graduation from a program</p>
<p><span>Measurement</span>			is the collection of data or information on the extent or frequency with which something occurs.</p>

<p>Performance standard		is a level of service considered satisfactory for the purpose of employment or certification.</p>
