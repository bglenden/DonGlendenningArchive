<div class="reader-summary">Don Glendenning authored an opinion piece for The Guardian newspaper advocating for numeracy as a foundational skill in PEI&#x27;s education system. He argues for curriculum reform to address gaps between school mathematics instruction and real-world competency needs identified by employers.</div>

<p><b>Dear Editor:</b></p>
<p><b>Numeracy</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>By my definition, education is any experience that has a formative affect on the way a person thinks, feels or acts; to thrive, citizens need a number of key skills; having a reasonable level of these key skills is good for the citizen and good for the community.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Recently, I’ve been reading about the importance of numeracy. The UK Numeracy Body recommends that a separate numeracy course be added to public school offering but the teaching and rating be expected of all teachers and not just math teachers. I’m convinced that numeracy is worth adding to our education offerings in PEI.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>According to what I read, numeracy skills are needed by every Islander; the content is essentially the same for all ages with the difference being only the level at which it is presented and performance expected of various learners.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I expect that it applies to students at the College and university as well. It is a natural for adults and night classes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Based on the recent education study in Souris, it could be helpful there and probably in most communities.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And it seems to address the need expressed by employers.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I’ve tried to find a master list of competencies without success; I even made a couple of enquiries in Ontario and they didn’t find what I wanted either.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I’m sharing this to let people know what I’ve discovered but also in the hope that we can find some way to narrow the perceived gap between math now being taught and math skills needed.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Happy New Year to all</p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Don Glendenning</p>
<p>A long-time student of education.</p>
