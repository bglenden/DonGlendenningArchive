  D 2014 Employers should
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">This letter calls for replacing high school diplomas with competency-based certification issued by independent bodies, similar to driver&#x27;s licenses or Royal Canadian Conservatory of Music certificates. Don critiques how diplomas serve primarily as screening devices that no longer guarantee skill levels. He references model schools in Calgary and Vancouver that allow competency-based assessment outside traditional school calendars. This piece articulates his vision for decoupling assessment from educational delivery and emphasizing demonstrated competency over credentials.</div>

<p>Dear Sir:</p>
<p><b>Replacement for High school diplomaSelection criteria</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Hiring practices are changing; certainly employers are still asking for school results but many are also interested in educational experiences outside school as well.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Job ads also are more often focused on describing the work to be done and the skills required than simply asking for credentials.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Employers tell me that a high school diploma is simply a screening device and no longer signifies a level of achievement; perhaps it never did and it is not likely that it ever will. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>We need a replacement for school diplomas, something equivalent to a drivers license.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Or better still, a certificate granted y an independent body confirming your level in a subject rather than your rank in class. Recently I came across an item in a paper describing schoole, In both Calgary and Vancouver I believe, about schools that had a separate testing servive where a student could write exams when they are ready rather thanat the convenience of schools.,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>something equivalent to a driver’s licence, that measures your level of skillsensures a basic level of skills.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Or even certification provided by the Royal Canadian Conservatory of Music.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Both these simply your level of achievement. I also read recently that Prinveton University was removing the cap on the number of A’s thst can br givrn, making it possible, it seems, for everyone in a class to get an A.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Providing this kind of certification is not the role of schools; I believe that it is time for an independent body, perhaps a qualification authority, to issue this kind of document.</p>
