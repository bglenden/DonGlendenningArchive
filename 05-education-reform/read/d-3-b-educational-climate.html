</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Don presents a comprehensive organizational critique arguing PEI&#x27;s Department should be renamed &quot;Department of Public Instruction&quot; to clarify actual function. He identifies systemic problems: emphasis on school attendance rather than education improvement, limited support for independent/part-time learners, services dominated by youth focus, emphasis on subject delivery over emotional and employment skill development, lack of customization, organizational structure serving schools rather than education strategy, accountability gaps (Minister operates schools but Premier monitors performance), and institutional silos preventing integrated services. This letter represents Don&#x27;s mature analysis of organizational dysfunction and his conviction that structural reform, not incremental adjustment, is necessary for systemic improvement in PEI education.</div>

<p>Dear Sir:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Role of Department of Education needs redefinition<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>An examination of the organization of education services on PEI quickly leads one to the conclusion that:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The Department of Public Instruction may be a more appropriate term than Department of Education</p>
<p>The emphasis is on having people in school rather than ensuring Islanders improve their education</p>
<p>Little support for part time and independent learners</p>
<p>Services are mostly for the young</p>
<p>There is great emphasis on the delivery of subject matter and little on<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>the development of emotional and employment skills</p>
<p>Lacks the ability to customize learning opportunities.</p>
<p>Department is organized to run schools; I fin little in organization reflects the operation of schools than policy, planning, performance and funding.</p>
<p>Because the Minister of Education operates schools, monitoring of performance, if any, rests with the Premier’s office.</p>
<p>System promotes silos – preschool, early childhood, public, private, employer based training and postsecondary institutes.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p><br></p>
