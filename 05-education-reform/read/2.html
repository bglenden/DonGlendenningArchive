<div class="reader-summary">Don addresses PEI&#x27;s need for a clear &quot;definition of education.&quot; He notes that while a previous Education Act included a definition, &quot;education&quot; was recently replaced with &quot;school&quot; in revision. He distinguishes between needing a school definition and maintaining education as a separate, broader concept, given their important differences. He observes that PEI now appears to have a &quot;school system&quot; rather than an &quot;education system.&quot; He urgently recommends the Department develop an &quot;education taxonomy&quot; and circulate it widely throughout the education community for clarity and shared understanding.</div>

<p>Dear Editor:</p>
<p><b>Definition of Education</b></p>
<p>PEI needs a definition of “education”.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The Education Act of a number of years ago included a definition but I learned recently that “education”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>had been replaced recently with ”school”.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Now, I have no objection to a definition of “school” but, in my books, education and schooling are not the same and using them interchangeably is confusing. Furthermore. while we refer to our education system, it appears that what we now have is really a school system.</p>
<p>Given the importance and complexity of education, I urge the Department to develop an education taxonomy soon and circulate it widely throughout the education community.</p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
<p>Don Glendenning</p>
