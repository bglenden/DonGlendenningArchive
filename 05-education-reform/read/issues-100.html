  Issues 100 .
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Comprehensive examination of education system complexity arising from individual uniqueness in physical, mental, emotional makeup, prior experience, learning pace and style. Addresses nine key issues: terminology confusion, unclear purpose, unidentified services, structural misalignment, insufficient autonomy, weak accountability, inadequate collaboration, missing education system (only school systems exist), and lack of transparency. Emphasizes that these issues are not new and require public engagement. (Dated September 18, 2024)</div>

ISSUES</b></p>
<p align="right" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 108%"><b>	___________________________________________________________________________</b></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 108%"><b>It
is widely recognized that education is a key factor in determining
each citizen’s quality of life; in the same way, the collective
education of our citizens determines, to a significant degree, the
quality of the community in which we live.  Education is complex,
made so by the fact that each person is unique in so many ways - 
unique in basic physical, mental and emotional makeup,  unique in the
range and nature of previous experience, unique in perceived futures,
and also unique in terms of learning pace, style and needs. Given
these complexities, some system-wide issues are not surprising:</b></p>
<ol>
	<li><p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0in"><b>Terminology
	</b><b>– </b>a
	common terminology improves communication throughout the
	organization. Nowhere is the error more prominent than the failure
	to differentiate between education and schooling. 
	</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.11in">Purpose
	– purpose provides the fundamental reason for establishing an
	organization, a reason for which something is done or created.
	Preparation for citizenship, personal development, self- management
	and preparation for work are common purposes.  PEI seems to have
	settled on helping Islanders “find
	a place”</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0in"><b>Education
	services </b><b>–
	</b>although<b>
	</b>education is a
	service, services are seldom identified.  Services include:
	information, counselling, instruction, learning products and
	technology, quality assurance. governance, funding and human
	resources. Learners may need any or all services at any point in
	their education journey. 
	</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0in"><b>Structure
	</b><b>–
	“form follows function” is the standad whenstructuring any
	venture. Typically government department structures reflect
	branches, categories or services rendered. ; PEI seem to focus
	instead, on clients served.</b></p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0in"><b>Autonomy
	- </b><b>f</b><b>ront
	line service providers (teachers) need both expertise and autonomy
	to respond to learner needs.</b>
	<b>The OECD tells us
	that PISA results are better for students in schools with autonomy
	for their day-to-day operation.</b></p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0in"><b>Accountability
	 -</b><b>
	Mathew Bedard of the Montreal Economic Institute points out that
	“autonomy and accountability jointly applied” would cost
	practically nothing and allow education to better adapt to the
	diversity of student needs and aptitudes. .</b></p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0in"><b>Collaboration
	</b><b>– the
	literature tells us that education thrives on collaboration and
	communication; Paul Bennet speaks of the “muffled voices of
	teachers” who work alone in classrooms, in fact the profession
	itself, sems to operate as a silo in the community.</b></p></li>
