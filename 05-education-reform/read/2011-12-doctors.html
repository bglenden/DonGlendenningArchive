  2011-12 Doctors
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Don draws parallels between healthcare and education systems, questioning whether education has equivalent to doctors, nurses, and technical specialists. He explores whether teachers function as doctors or nurses, whether principals are instructional leaders or administrators, and where specialists fit in organizational structures. Don notes healthcare has referral pathways while education appears more rigid, and proposes examining whether separate &quot;before-school&quot; and &quot;after-school&quot; educational services exist. He calls for education to adopt healthcare&#x27;s &quot;model of care&quot; redesign approach, suggesting systematic review of how education cares for all learners throughout their lifespan.</div>

<p>Dear Editor:</p>
<p><b>Are Teachers our Doctors or Nurses?</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>My proposal in an earlier letter about a need for an unaligned organization in support of reading</p>
<p>improvement brought some interesting responses. ln pursuing the comparison with the health sector,</p>
<p>l'm left to wonder if there is such a thing as a" learner care team" in education and if so, who is on the</p>
<p>team and who leads it?</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Addressing a health problem often starts with a visit to a family doctor. (Do we need a family</p>
<p>educator?) Depending on a doctor's diagnosis, a patient may be referred to another doctor, a nurse, x-</p>
<p>ray technician, or others; a different health issue may take us to a different team. And then we can</p>
<p>access a variety of health care professionals, optometrist, dentist, audiologist, without seeing a family</p>
<p>doctor. And in most cases there are nurses, technicians, and others diagnosing our problem and</p>
<p>providing treatment. lt is also possible that one may end up in a hospital (ls that the equivalent of being</p>
<p>in a school?) and a different team of health professionals altogether. And then we have a great variety</p>
<p>of specialist who provide after care.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Does/should education have the equivalent of doctors, nurses and technical support staff? lf so, are</p>
<p>teachers our doctors or are they nurses? Are school principals "principal teachers" or are they</p>
<p>equivalent to hospital administrators? Should or can they fill both roles? Do we need people in</p>
<p>education who provide the equivalent of blood work, x-rays or therapy And where do specialists fit in?</p>
<p>ls there a need, for instance, for the equivalent of day surgery or outpatients? The difference in the</p>
<p>treatment of learners and patients, a friend suggests, may be that education can be ignored but health</p>
<p>matters cannot.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Our health delivery system is currently implementing a new "model of care"; it's time for a similar</p>
<p>discussion about the best way to care, not just students, but all our learners including before they start</p>
<p>school and after they leave.. lt may even be time to design a new system. Your views are welcome at</p>
<p>sta nda rds2020@ema i l.com.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
<p><br></p>
