  Governance-2 amended
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Don responds to the School Board&#x27;s invitation for governance input by strongly advocating for devolution of decision-making authority to schools and teachers. He cites OECD research showing students perform better when schools have autonomy over daily operations. The letter emphasizes that while PEI has quality staff, they are constrained by centralized control. Don argues that freedom to act, combined with accountability, enables teachers to respond to student needs more effectively than top-down mandates.</div>

<p>Editor,</p>
<p>Charlottetown Guardian</p>
<p>Charlottetown, PEI	</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Dear Sir:</p>
<p><b>Governance</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>The Guardian of Wednesday, January 29 carried an item in which the English School Board invited input into a review of governance (School Board seeks public input on governance policies). I commend the Board for the public invitation and urge readers to respond.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Too often we criticize our school system but too seldom do we make suggestions, even when invited.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I am a strong believer in giving people freedom to act, and holding them accountable for their action.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Therefore, I strongly urge a general devolution of decision-making authority at all levels, but especially devolution to teachers and schools.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I make this plea, based on my own experience but also based on the OECD finding that, where schools have significant autonomy over their day to day operation, students perform better.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Autonomy means different things in different countries, in some it is freedom to select textbooks and or decide courses to be offered, in others schools play a major role in developing budgets and allocating resources, while still others allow schools actually develop their own staffing patterns and hire and allocate staff accordingly. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Schools are places where young people go to obtain help with learning the skills needed to function in, contribute to and enjoy life. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The amount of help learners receive will depend, to a large degree on the quality of professional staff and their freedom to do what needs to be done.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I believe that our quality is as good as any; it’s time to give freedom a chance.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Don Glendenning</p>
