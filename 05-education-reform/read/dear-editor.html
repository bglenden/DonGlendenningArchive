  Dear Editor
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Don recounts a formative 1969 visit to PEI as newly appointed Holland College president. Meeting with Dr. Edward Sheffield, an education adviser, Don noticed Sheffield&#x27;s constant response to questions was &quot;that is another thing that must be done first.&quot; Don found inspiration in Alan Paton&#x27;s &quot;Cry the Beloved Country,&quot; adopting the principle &quot;do the next right thing&quot; as his problem-solving approach. He applies this philosophy to education reform, advocating for clarity of purpose first and departmental role clarification as essential starting points.</div>

<p>Dear Editor:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><b>The Next Right Thing in Education</b></p>
<p>I’d like to tell a little story; it’s a true story and it’s about me.</p>
<p>In mid-January of 1969.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I made my first visit to PEI to meet the College Planning Committee and Provincial education officials. Also here was Dr. Edward Sheffield, Adviser to the Province on matters of higher education. Between meetings, Dr. Sheffield and I talked often and long about education generally and the emerging Holland College in particular. Dr. Sheffield was a seasoned educator; I had many questions. One of his standard answers to my questioning was “That is another thing that must be done first”.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>By<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>the end of the week, the list of unanswered questions had lengthened not shortened.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>At that time, South Africa was dealing with the issue of apartheid. A friend loaned me a book on the South African issue, <b>Cry the Beloved Country</b> . In it I found the phrase “do the next right thing.” It became a standard approach to problem-solving ever since. I commend it to readers.</p>
<p>So how does this apply to education in PEI? Let me give two examples/</p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li1">Education in PEI needs a clear purpose. Purpose sets direction; the purpose of public education in PEI<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>is not clear. We should review and restate.</li>
  <li class="li1">The role of the Department of Education (in its own words) is limited to “developing<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>and delivering” curriculum to young people; a narrow role indeed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If that is true, we probably should reorganize the Department accordingly; if that role-statement is not the case, we should correct it and probably reorganize the Department accordingly.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
</ul>
<p>That education needs to change is without question; it is only a matter of where to start. The “next right thing” worked for me; it encourages and allows change to occur with a minimum disruption. I commend it to readers</p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
<p>Don Glendenning</p>
