<p>Dear Mr. Gillis:		</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>This is a follow-up to my letter of October 17 and will update you on some of our activities.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>First I should mention a change of name from Education First Canada Inc. to <span>Education 20/20 Inc</span>., the name under which we are incorporated.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We made the change because of our national aspirations and our intention to operate in both languages. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Since I last wrote, Education 20/20 Inc.:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li7">Has delayed launching our newsletter until such time as we have a logo and website</li>
  <li class="li7">Has organized a workshop on Early Childhood Education.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A panel, comprised of practitioners, shared their experiences and approaches that work; participants included other early childhood workers, parents, educators and members of the community at large.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We plan to offer workshops in other Island communities in the months ahead.</li>
  <li class="li7">Has a committee looking into the matter of testing a new software package, developed in Canada for community engagement to assess whether or not it will have any application to our work.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This is being undertaken because of the evidence that there is a direct relationship between the level of engagement in a school and improved student achievement.</li>
  <li class="li7">Plans to make an award to an Island school that best exemplifies a high level of engagement in its every day school activities; criteria, policies and procedures are now under development.</li>
  <li class="li7">Has begun the process of engaging educators, especially decision makers, in a regular dialogue about educational issues, with reading skills of high school graduates being at the top of our list.</li>
  <li class="li7">Is exploring ways to gather, produce and publish information about education of interest the public at large.</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p>I trust that this information will be useful in your consideration of our proposal.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If you need additional information or would like to discuss the matter further, please do not hesitate to contact me.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>With best wishes for the holiday season.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
<p><br></p>

<p>President</p>
