<div class="reader-summary">Official meeting minutes from Education 20/20 Awards Committee meeting on May 12, 2016, at BMO Nesbit Burns in Charlottetown. Attended by Peter Russell, Steve MacQuaid, and Don Glendenning (Chair). Minutes document evaluation of four nominations: Grace Christian School (nominated by Natalie MacNeill for comprehensive technology integration), Charlottetown Rural High School (nominated by Rebecca Rioux for impressive wireless technology pilot implementation with strong staff engagement), Down to Earth Child Care (nominated by Ilse Peters-Ching for potential technology use despite current lack of resources). Committee unanimously selected Grace Christian School based on how technology genuinely supported the school&#x27;s educational philosophy and mission. Discussion included future award directions, recommendations for focused annual themes, donor engagement, and strategic communication about awards.</div>

<p>Agenda: Following nominations were distributed in advance of meeting</p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li3"><b></b><span><b>Natalie MacNeil</b></span> nominated <span><b>Grace Christian School </b></span>where she is Director of Development.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Grace Christian School is a small<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>K-12 private school of 150 students located in Charlottetown.</li>
</ul>
<p>The nomination papers presented a clearly articulated philosophy of education and then went on to tell how technology was used to support it.</p>
<p><br></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li3"><b></b><span><b>Rebecca Rioux</b></span><b>, nominated</b> Charlottetown Rural High School where she is the vice-Principal. Charlottetown Rural High School is one of the schools chosen to “pilot” the new technology offerings on PEI; committee members were impressed with the level of engagement by staff, with the effort and energy put onto its implementation, and the level of organization to ensure availability of services to students and teachers alike, especially in view of the short implementation period.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
</ul>
<p>. <span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li3"><b></b><span><b>Ilse Peters-Ching</b></span>, nominated the Down to Earth child Care Centre in Bothwell, PEI and included a letter from the Director, Shelly Manning pointing out some of the ways she would use technology, if the school had it. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>While an interesting nomination, it fell far outside the award criteria</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li3"><b>Discussion:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></li>
</ul>
<p>The choice of Grace Christian School came quickly and unanimously based primarily on the manner and extent to which the technology was linked to furtherance of the schools philosophy; the Committee felt that the application of technology truly grew out of and supported the school’s mission.</p>
<p><br></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li3"><b>Future Awards</b>:</li>
</ul>
<p>Committee members discussed the future of the Award initiative and concluded that offering an award is a worthwhile effort, that it deserves more coverage both in our own publications and in the media.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There was a further suggestion that next year’s award be directed towards a specific engagement of a class or school linked directly to school objectives. The Committee also recommended that the donor be invited to continue the Award for two more years and then a full review be undertaken.</p>
