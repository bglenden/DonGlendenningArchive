<p><b>LEARNING FOR LIFE</b></p>
<p><b>Introduction</b></p>
<p><b>Some time ago, each of us was dumped unceremoniously on life’s road and we’ve been on that road and scrambling ever since, scrambling to adjust, scrambling to understand, scrambling to prepare for the road ahead.</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>If you are reading or listening to this presentation, you are still on life’s road and may well be still scrambling;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>What you can do today, as compared to yesterday or twenty years ago constitutes your education – that is, any and all experiences that have changed, had a formative effect on a your attitude, skill and knowledge. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>But life’s road also causes and allows us to be teachers as well as learners, especially teachers to our children. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Given that learners and learning are at the heart of education, we start our conversation about what we know and believe about learners and learning.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b>It is important to understand what happening to ourselves as we learn and also how we can be even more effective in supporting the learning of others, especially our children. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>To provide a framework for making decisions, Education 20/20 Inc. has developed this miniseries of videos; we hope that it will help you understand both your own learning process as well as ways that you can help others.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Having a framework:</b></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li3"><b>helps our understanding.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></li>
  <li class="li3"><b>improves the consistency of our decisions<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></li>
  <li class="li3"><b>insures that elements are left out by design not by accident.</b></li>
</ul>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>This framework identifies five components:</b></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li3"><b>Learner<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></li>
  <li class="li3"><b>Learning</b></li>
  <li class="li3"><b>Context</b></li>
  <li class="li3"><b>Support</b></li>
  <li class="li3"><b>Levels</b></li>
</ul>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>In addition, we’ve added diagrams of the learning process from both the learner’s and teacher’s perspectives.</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>We hope that you will enjoy listening and viewing this series as much as we enjoyed producing it.</b></p>
