  2016-9 Small Schools
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Don defends small schools against closure bias, citing studies showing they improve student achievement, increase attendance and graduation rates, elevate teacher satisfaction, and improve safety—while maintaining lower costs per graduate. A Wisconsin 2000 study recommended increasing small schools, not closing them. He notes Ontario&#x27;s 2005 definition of small schools (under 200 elementary, 500 high school students). He argues that educational philosophy determines school design, proposing piloting community autonomy with bulk funding to discover innovative small school models rather than defaulting to closure.</div>

<p>Dear Editor:</p>
<p><b>Small schools</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>The future of small school is always on the agenda and recommendations, if any, usually favor closure.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Yet studies show that small schools “improve student achievement, increase attendance, increase graduation rates, elevate teacher satisfaction and improve school safety” and, in fact, small schools have lower costs per graduate.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A Wisconsin study in 2000 recommended, not closing small schools, but rather increasing the number of small schools as a way to improve the quality of education in that State. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In saying this, I am aware that, according to an Ontario report in 2005, any elementary school with fewer than 200 students and high schools with fewer than 500 is considered a small school.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>One’s views on school operation is a reflection of one’s views of education.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If the goal is to provide the same services in the same way, using the same formulae, many small schools will close. If, instead, one considers schooling to be only part of an education system, small schools may still have a role. It would be interesting to offer one or two communities a blank piece of paper, autonomy in day to day decision making and bulk funding to see what options might emerge.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We may be pleasantly surprised by the results.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
