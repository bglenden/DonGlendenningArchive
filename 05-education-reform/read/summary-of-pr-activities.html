  Summary of PR activities
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">This document chronicles Don Glendenning&#x27;s comprehensive promotional strategy for the inaugural 2014 Education 20/20 Award, spanning February 20 to March 14. Activities include: advising the Saskatchewan Teachers&#x27; Society Association, notifying the PEI High School Federation, contacting regional media outlets, circulating newsletters to approximately 115 people (including Department of Education officials and early childhood center directors), emailing journalists and reporters, and coordinating a CBC Morning show interview on March 13 with broadcast on March 14. The systematic approach demonstrates Glendenning&#x27;s sophisticated public relations and stakeholder engagement methodology.</div>

<div class="reader-content">
<p>Following our conversation this afternoon, I decided to document the promotional steps taken; I did  this for my own information and while it was still fresh in my mind in case the matter should come up.  Below are the steps taken:</p>
<p> </p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li3">February 20 -   Advised SSTA of award and asked that information be passed  along to members and others; received “will do” response</li>
  <li class="li3">February 20 – Advised Shirley Jay, PEIHSF that the award was posted on our website; spoke with Shirley today and was told that a notice had been included in their March Newsletter – not sure of the date; informed that local HSF presidents usually post, blog or otherwise to inform their people of items in the newsletter. post<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li3">February 20 -  Advised Gail Lecky that Award was posted on our website; a couple of days later, Gail acknowledged that it was posted; I checked their website  earlier today and found her posting prominently displayed.</li>
  <li class="li3">February 24 – Resent documents to Bruce when  earlier Email bounced back</li>
  <li class="li3">February 25 – I believe following a visit to Summerside, I emailed a set of documents to LaVoix Acadienne</li>
  <li class="li3">February 25 – I believe following a visit to Summerside, I Emailed award documents to Journal Pioneer</li>
  <li class="li3">March 3 -     Emailed Newsletter No. 3 to Education 20/20 mailing list about 115 people including DM, Supt, and a few people in                     schools, early childhood centres, UPEI, and the Department of Education</li>
  <li class="li3">March 3 -     Email and attachments sent to 10 journalists/reporters</li>
  <li class="li3">March 7 –    Sent copy of release to Carolyn Drake at Guardian; Email indicates that we had spoken earlier</li>
  <li class="li3">March 11 – Emailed announcement to 11 journalists/reporters</li>
  <li class="li3">March 13 – sent an application in response to an enquiry from a Charlottetown School</li>
  <li class="li3">March 13 – an interview with Lindsay Carroll, CBC morning</li>
  <li class="li3">March 13 – conversation with Gail Lecky; she thought the time short given spring break; she said that she was emailing information to a school and I emailed her a cover sheet and confirmed the closing date</li>
  <li class="li3">March 14 – interview aired on CBC Morning show</li>
</ul>
<p>While talking with PEIHSF today, I mentioned having just come from a conversation during which  the matter of postponement was raised; the unsolicited advice was “don’t do it”.</p>
