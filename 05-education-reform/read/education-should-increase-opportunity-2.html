  Education should increase opportunity-2
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">From October 14, 2014, Don recounts a student&#x27;s life-altering decision to accept a lower-level math course recommendation, dramatically reducing college/university prospects and likely lifetime income. He argues schools should open doors, not close them. Presented as a concrete case study, the letter shows Don&#x27;s emotional investment in individual student outcomes and his conviction that well-intentioned teacher decisions can have devastating consequences when they narrow rather than expand student possibilities.</div>

<p>Dear Sir:</p>
<p>Closing doors</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I didn’t have a happy Thanksgiving, in fact most of the past month has been stressful.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The cause of my stress is an event in the life of a student, a person I have never met but whose family I know and whose future has been limited because of a teacher’s professional decision.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I’ve heard similar stories before, but this time I actually “experienced” it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Granted, I do noty know the whole story but here’s my ubderstanding.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>A high school student, with hopes, even plans to go to college or university, was having difficulty with math; that’s not unusual, I am told that struggling with math is not uncommon. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>So what are a school’s options?</p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li1">Let the a student struggle and likely fail a grade,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li1">Offer an upgrading course after graduation</li>
  <li class="li1">Provide extra instruction</li>
  <li class="li1">Transfer to the student a lower level course</li>
  <li class="li1">Blame the home</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p>The teacher recommended number 4; the student took the teacher’s advice.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This is a life-altering event in that it dramatically reduces the likelihood of that<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>student going to college or university, reduces the chance of a smooth transition to employment and<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>likely significantly reduce his lifetime income. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Schools should open doors not close them.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
<p><br></p>
