  D  What education should be free
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Published April 6, 2014, this letter addresses the preparedness gap identified in the Community Foundation&#x27;s youth report. Don attributes the gap to social promotion practices and insufficient teaching support time. Rather than accepting school limitations, he proposes two innovations: allowing teachers to open professional tutoring offices (similar to medical or legal clinics) and establishing independent testing centers to certify skill levels outside school grade systems. Both services would be publicly funded, reflecting his belief that educational support is a legitimate public responsibility.</div>

<p>Dear Sir:</p>
<p><b>Closing the preparedness gap</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>The recent report on issues of Island youth conducted by the Community Foundation of Prince Edward Island identified preparedness gaps with regards to ”readiness for post-secondary study and the workplace (www.cfpei.ca).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Although the nature oooooand extent of the view require further study, recent public discussions organized by Education 20/20 shows that the public is of the same view as the students. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Helping students close the gap is clearly a public school responsibility.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The problem appears to result from two things; the prevalence of social promotion and the unwillingness of schools to extend teaching support time.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Based on comments heard during a recent series of public workshops, the public is not sure that our school system can rise to the occasion.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As an alternative why not:</p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li1">Allow teachers to open professional offices for the teaching of math and literacy, much like legal or medical clinics for some specialties.</li>
  <li class="li1">Establish independent testing centres for people who want, or need, a “certificate” to prove their performance level.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p>The firs measure ensures that students gets the help they need and the second removes the perceived potential to meddle with grades. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Obviously both services would be “free”.<span class="Apple-converted-space">     </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Your views are always welcome at standards2020@gmail.com.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
<p><br></p>
