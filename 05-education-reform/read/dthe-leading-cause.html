  Dthe leading cause
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">From July 10, 2014, Don argues schools face a systemic crisis: they focus on knowledge delivery while parents expect educated citizens; institutions matter less; teachers shouldn&#x27;t award credentials (like coaches vs. referees); public education lacks market forces incentivizing improvement; and time-based progression replaces standards maintenance. He advocates for government ensuring quality education through unbundled service delivery rather than direct school operation. His analysis is systemic: the problem isn&#x27;t individual schools but the education system&#x27;s structural misalignment with modern needs.</div>

<p>Dear Sir:</p>
<p><b>The leading cause<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>Is there such a thing as a leading cause, a deficiency, as to why people aren’t accepted into postsecondary studies or a first job?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Can we trace non-acceptance to something missing in their previous education?</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>If lack of acceptance has an educational cause, exactly what is it?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Could causes be ranked such as:</p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li1">Writing</li>
  <li class="li1">Math</li>
  <li class="li1">Work/study skills</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Some say it’s a crisis, some say it’s an epidemic, some say it is a fabrication, but most would agree, that our public schools are not meeting expectations.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In support of their views, some quote PISA test scores, some refer to the huge amounts of money spent on upgrading students who have just completed 12 years of public schooling, employers mention the “new hires” who cannot do simple math or follow simple instructions and of course, there’s always the comment about young people who lack basic work skills.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Although some readers may disagreewith the above, the view is widespread.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>We do have problems with public education, mostly because the world is changing but education is not; changes are more like climate change than a flood, hurricane or heat wave. Change was predictable, it is observable and will not correct itself.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As evidence:<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li1">Schools continue to focus on delivery of knowledge; parents want their children to be educated not just schooled; schools have not made the transition.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li1">The Importance of institutions in acquiring an education is on the decline; we need to increase investment in other community agencies such as Junior Achievement and 4-H.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li1">The role of schools and teachers is to help people learn; credentials and qualifications should not be determined or awarded by those who teach. Think coaches and referees, for example.</li>
  <li class="li1">We have a school system masquerading as an education system; the role of government is to ensure a quality education for every Islander; government should remove itself from the actual operation of schools and unbundle the delivery of education services.</li>
  <li class="li1">Of all sectors, education is the least open to market forces; there are no apparent benefits to any stakeholder for producing the same quality in a shorter period of time or producing a better quality.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We know how to do it better but lack the incentive to do so.</li>
  <li class="li1">Instead of adjusting time to maintain standards, the school system adjusts standards to meet time frames.</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p>When we experience an emergency in health, justice or safety, we call on our Chief Medical Officer, EMO or even a swat team; perhaps we need an equivalent to help us through our education emergency. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
