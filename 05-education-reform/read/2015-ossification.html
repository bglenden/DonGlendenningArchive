  2015 Ossification
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Don draws on David McLaughlin&#x27;s essay about federal public service renewal to address &quot;idea ossification&quot; in education policy. He observes that fear of failure and political criticism creates barriers to innovation in education. Don identifies a problematic disconnect where educators primarily discuss education with other educators, and the public talks mainly to itself. He calls for reciprocal dialogue, suggesting the public should initiate conversations with educators about educational reform and advocating for program chairs to organize speaker series. This piece emphasizes the importance of critical thinking and public engagement.</div>

<p>Editor,</p>

<p>Dear Sir:</p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>The Globe and Mail of August 22, 2014 carried an item on renewing the Federal public service (Five ways to renew the public service by David McLaughlin).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Item number three on his list was to “think out loud with smart, committed Canadians.” <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>According to McLaughlin, “fear of failure is endemic to large bureaucracies, but fear of facing others in case one is challenged over politics is a recipe for idea ossification and policy stasis.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This fear is a major barrier to change in education as well.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>While the count of words about education in print and on air is increasing, at the moment it is mostly educators talking to educators and members of the public talking to other members of the public; too seldom do the groups talk to each other – and education suffers as a result. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>It’s alright to think out loud about education – especially if you are a taxpayer, parent or employer.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Teacher or student?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Probably not.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>It is unlikely, at least in the short run, that educators will do an about face and start conversations about education with the public, so why not the reverse?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Let the public initiate conversations with teachers and other educators. If you are a member of a group, ask the program chair to organize a program on education.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>For the first invitation, let the speaker choose the topic; for the second presentation, select a topic, then find a speaker. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><span>Begin thinking out loud about education - today.</span></p>
<p><span></span><br></p>

<p><b>Myth about grade levels<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>Grade levels are an administrative convenience and nothing more.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>To mix metaphors, grade levels are mythical but sacred cows of education. On the one hand, they are widely held beliefs that are exempt from criticism while, on the other, they are widely held beliefs that have no foundation in fact.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is a control mechanism.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Take mathematics, for example, people of different ages may study mathematics and people reach different levels in mathematics regardless of their age.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>but I can find no basis for tying the two together. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>It’s time to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
