<p>Dear Sir:</p>
<p><b>Action expected<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I start from the premise that most young people can learn most things that schools offer although it may take some a little longer than others; failure to reach a desired standard cannot and should not be blamed on either the community or the home, but may require an adjustment in the nature or extent of services needed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Lack of support in the home or school may be a factor but is not an acceptable excuse.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Islanders want their schools to provide young people with a reasonable level of reading, writing and arithmetic skills; but they are of the view that that is not happening at the moment.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It appears that many young people are graduating from high school without the basic skills needed to access further studies or enter employment.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>we are putting limits on their futures. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The view must be valid because so far at least, government has not explained, denied or refuted this view.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If this were in any other field, Islanders would simply take their business elsewhere, and that is possible for the people who can afford it. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Islanders are concerned; they expect action and they also expect to be consulted. As long as government continues, not only to run schools, but to limit competition, it owes Islanders an explanation and a plan of action</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>This is likely as good a place as any to begin the improvement process.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
<p><br></p>

<p>Sincerely</p>
