  conversation Some time ago
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Fragmentary draft reflecting on earlier letter about need for public discussion on education. Reconsidering approach—argues need is not conversation but structural change from school system to education system. Mentions mathematics/numeracy as key example (frequent in conversations, subject of public concern).</div>

<div class="reader-content">
<p>Some time ago, I drafted a letter to the Editor pointing out the need for public discussion on matters of education. I did this based on my personal interest and experience in education and more importantly, issues that arose in my many conversations with Islanders about education matters. While I still believe we need conversation, the real need is to switch from a school system to an education sytem.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>While I write this about PEI, other provinces should also consider the same change.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>On further reflection I ee the issuue, rather than suggesting conversations, propose tat PEI establishat an education system decided to spark debate by putting n issue on the table. PEI needs an education system.</p>
<p>An ducation system is an organization established<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>for the purpose of helping people to improve the level and nature of<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>their education.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>education. The literature tells us that people typically need the following help: information, counselling,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>on a subject that I frequently encounter – a matter key to content, curriculum maters, grading and future life roles.; the issue of purpose.</p>
<p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>that of mathematics, arithmetic, numeracy. I choose these for three reasons: (1) they are key to advancing in any field, (2) they are raised most often in my discussions, (3) they have<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>been the subject of public concern. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>As an example,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
