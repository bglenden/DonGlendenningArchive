  Issues 2
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">A letter from Don Glendenning (signed at end) addressing issues in education to an editor, likely the Charlottetown Guardian. The letter reflects on Don&#x27;s 50 years on PEI and his observations of how education&#x27;s meaning has narrowed from a broad developmental process to a focus on acquiring credentials (diplomas and degrees). He notes that PISA results have replaced community standards, and laments the loss of specific institutions (PVI and PCVH). Don advocates for system review addressing: common definitions glossary, stated program purposes, conceptual clarity, assessment methods, autonomy and accountability definitions, collaboration between providers and users, universal rating scales, informative transcripts, and recognition of learning context importance. He proposes two-stage reform: first, public conversation about education needs and development of vision/principles; second, a delivery plan. The letter calls for locally-led processes with outside specialist assistance, emphasizing that &quot;everything should be on the table.&quot; This encapsulates Don&#x27;s reform methodology: vision before structure.</div>

<div class="reader-content">
<p>Dear Editor:</p>
<p>About Issues 2</p>
<p>Issues in Education</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>For some time now, I have engaged with Islanders in conversations about education; topics include learners, learning, continuing education, math, politicization, transition to employment, autonomy, accountability, and the list goes on. My conversations reveal a desire for information and dialogue, not just about school matters, but also about education - and how it can be improved.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>At its simplest, learning refers to a person engaging in an activity intended to change what they know and the way they think, feel or act; teaching, on the other hand, is a process helping others change the way they think, feel or act. One’s education is the result of the experiences that have altered the ways that a person thinks, feels or acts. Having an education or being educated may be thought of as a person’s stage of development; people with a good education are better able to deal with circumstances they encounter throughout their lives than persons with a limited education. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Education is also a sector of the economy; a large and complex set of programs and services intended to help people learn; services such as information, instruction, counselling, finance, learning products, technology, quality assurance, governance and people.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Given a population of nearly 160,000 people, a Department of Education has potentially a large pool of clients needing or wanting help.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>	It appears to me that the meaning of education has narrowed since 	my arrival on PEI some 50 years ago; education is now thought of and 	treated as a product rather than a service. The emphasis has shifted to 	getting “a 	high 	school, college or university diploma or degree” 	rather than 	getting a teacher’s license, journeyman’s standing or 	engineering qualification; PISA results have replaced community `	`standards. Islanders frequently comment on the loss of PVI and PCVH.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  	</span>One should 	also note the changed federal-provincial partnership in 	terms of the education of adults.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>	The results of my explorations call for review of the system – a 	glossary of common definitions, clearly stated program purposes, 	conceptual clarity, assessment, defined autonomy and accountability of individuals 	and institutions, increased collaboration between providers and users 	of education services, holistic or universal rating scales, more 	informative student transcripts and greater recognition of the 	importance of context to the learning process. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>	But let’s start with public conversations about our education needs.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  	</span>Let’s 	engage Islanders in conversation about what they need and want 	by way of education, develop a clear statement of what we hope to 	accomplish both for individuals and the Island Community, and a set 	overarching principles to guide its operation. Everything should 	be on the table. The process should be led by locally led and assisted 	by outside specialists, if needed. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>	Stage two should involve a plan for delivery.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Don Glendenning</p>
