  4 Reading cost
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Research document on reading instruction economics and comprehensive reading improvement strategy. Analyzes per-student schooling cost ($10,000/year) as insufficient metric without understanding cost breakdown. Notes research suggesting 35-40 hours tutoring needed to raise reading level one grade at $2,000 cost per level. Cites statistics on magnitude of problem: 42% of adults below level 3 literacy, Canadian students performing below national average on reading tests, 30% of Grade 6 students unable to read adequately, community college students requiring remediation. Proposes comprehensive multi-stage initiative to improve reading through public engagement, educator training, standards development, system support (reading clinics, qualification authority), and community information. Identifies reading as &quot;golden skill&quot; foundational to all learning and key to individual opportunity and community development.

<p><b>Cost</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>The cost of schooling runs about $10,000 per student per year.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That figure is interesting but not very useful because I do not know what costs are included.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There are certain direct costs such as teacher salaries which, I assume, are attributable to the students that a teacher serves; the costs of technology lab would be spread across all students who use that lab.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>school transportation costs could be be charged against all students or only those who use the service, then there snow removal and parking lot improvement costs that are oftenborne by<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>the Department of Public Transportation?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>So, although I find the figure useful, for planning purposes it is not very useful</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>While the above is interesting, the important figure, however, is to know the cost for each student receiving a diploma:<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Or the cost for each person who doesn’t.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Since reading is such a key skill, I’d be interested in knowing what it costs to teach a person to read.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I recvall reading somewhere,but unfortunately cannot find the article now, that it takes on average 35-40 h0urs of tutoring to raise a person’s reading level by one grade.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If that is true, 40 hours of tutoring at $50 per hour would mean a cost of $2,000 per grade level.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I/m sure my figures are way<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>off base, but I’d be interested in the real ones.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It seems to me that obtaining such figures would be a relatively easy task.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If I find them, I’ll certainly let you know.</p>

<p><b>Findings and conclusions</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Many outcomes not measurable</b></p>
<p><b>Not all statements aew outcomes</b></p>
<p><b>Language needs to be simplified</b></p>
<p><b>Need for a master list of outcomes that would apply at all levels; tracking learner progress throughout life;<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>for planning, to show progress, allows for circular curriculum,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Rating scale needs to be developed that includes performance criteria</b></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li1">No common set of reading competencies</li>
  <li class="li1">Little exchange of information among teachers of reading across the system</li>
  <li class="li1">Early childhood needs customized support</li>
  <li class="li1">Students and families need an advocate</li>
  <li class="li1">What does it costto raise a person’s reading performance by one level</li>
  <li class="li1"></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Recommendations:</b> <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li3">Replacement of outcomes with competencies</li>
  <li class="li3">Provide all learners with a personal reading record – a list of competencies and indicating their levels on each</li>
  <li class="li3">A minimal level of performance in order to graduate</li>
  <li class="li3">Clearly identified assessment criteria such as vocabulary, comprehension and speed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></li>
  <li class="li3">Providing a written description for each performance level – not to exceed seven.</li>
  <li class="li3">Identifying a benchmark such as “Level three denotes a person who can read and discuss articles found in the daily newspaper”.</li>
  <li class="li3">Making all of the above information available to learners, parents and the public.</li>
  <li class="li3">Including the outcome with the level of performance on report cards. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
</ul>
