  2013-01 Golden Skill
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Addressing widespread concern about reading proficiency, Don cites alarming statistics: PEI 15-year-olds ranking below other provinces in reading/writing, 30% of Canadian Grade 6 students unable to read adequately, 30% of PEI adults lacking functional literacy. He notes interventions show promise and calls for sustained public engagement. Rather than treating reading as a discrete subject, Don suggests establishing independent reading clinics operating outside schools. He emphasizes public engagement as key to change, urging conversations with principals, school trustees, MLAs, and community members.</div>

<p>Editor, Charlottetown Guardian</p>
<p>Charlottetown, PEI	</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Dear Sir:</p>
<p><b>The Golden Skill</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>I’ve been reflecting on what I’ve heard and learned about education during the past few months and without doubt, reading tops the list of concerns.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Reading, “the golden skill”, is key to our individual and collective futures.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Statistics, at least the ones in my file, are not very comforting.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Having said that, however, I must say that current interventions in our school system seem to be producing results – although I do not yet have the supporting numbers.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>As evidence of public concern, here are some media comments:</p>
<p>The Guardian, Sept 28, 2006:<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>International tests place 15 year-olds in PEI lower than other Provinces in reading and writing.</p>
<p>Globe and Mail Sept 15, 2009: “Children who aren’t reading well by the end of Grade 3 are at risk of dropping out or failing to graduate</p>
<p>Globe and Mail Sept 15, 2009: estimates that by the end of Grade 6, at least 30 percent of Canadian students can’t read or write well enough to succeed in school</p>
<p>PEI Literacy Alliance - The reading skills of 30% of PEI adults are so limited that they cannot deal with most printed<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>material.</p>
<p><span><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span>Brink, Literacy in PEI: “If we keep doing what we do now, the number of people (in Canada) with low literacy will increase at the rate of about 100,000 a year.”</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Readers interested in the numbers should view a report by Satya Brink, Literacy in PEI: Implications of Findings from IALSS, 2003; it is available on-line.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I write this letter at this time because I am not sure that decision makers in education realize how concerned Islanders, including educators, are about the issue; having heard their concerns, I feel a responsibility to pass them on.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I know that reading is not a school subject, not like biology or not even like physical education, but that may be part of the problem. Or maybe reading<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>would be better handled through reading clinics, operating outside schools, like dental or eye clinics. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>A key to change is public engagement, asking questions and making your views known. Don’t wait for someone else to start the conversation.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Talk with the principal of your school, then talk to your friends and neighbours, ask the WI to put it on the agenda for their next meeting, talk to a school board member, your MLA, and anyone else who will listen – <span>and do it now and often</span>. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And after the conversation, send me a note at<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>HYPERLINK "mailto:standards2020@gmail.com" <span>standards2020@gmail.com</span><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
<p><br></p>
