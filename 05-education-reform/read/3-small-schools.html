  3 Small schools
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Glendenning proposes that the false choice between closing and maintaining small schools misses better alternatives. He advocates examining successful educational practices elsewhere, including the role of learning environment, teacher expectations, and technological innovation. He suggests pilot &quot;charter-style schools&quot; in affected communities with flexible staffing, expanded computer access, and distance education options. Rather than choosing between status quo and closure, he champions redesigning the system itself to make small schools educationally and economically viable.</div>

<p>Charlottetown, PEI</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Dear Editor:</p>
<p>Small schools: another perspective</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The debate about what should/may happen to small schools continues on many levels.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>On the one hand, school boards want to provide a quantity educational experience for students within constrained financial support. Others are concerned with the impact on the community, including the children, of closing an important community institution. Neither side of the debate seems to be talking about the issues of concern to the other side. The debate is healthy but the appropriate response may not lie in either of the proposed resolutions,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I am not current on the most recent thinking about the relationships between school size and quality of education although I am aware of the debate. Recently our evening news carried pictures of, students protesting the closure small schools in Nova Scotia. I am also aware of some of the controversy over the years on the subject in England" Given the current state of discussion on PEl, the time may be right to reflect on alternatives which will address the issue. I say this not to avoid controversy, but simply-to resolve the issue in the best interests of the student.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>After all, schools are for students and, if we keep the needs of learners at the centre of our thinking, we will likely go wrong in the decision*making process"</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The resolutisn may lie in the examination of some of the current thinking and latest developments in education elsewhere" For example, there is some evidence that one of the keys to successful school is the "learning-environment. By that i mean the expectations of students, the focus on. Learning, the relationship between learners and teachers, close linkages between the school and the community, school or site based management, etc. The principal plays a key role in setting the educational climate.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>At the same time, we are in the midst of a technological revolution in which information is available, or can be delivered, to learners both at home and at school. ln this sense, learners are not so dependent on teachers to deliver information. Much of what is found in textbooks is now available on the internet and it is probably even more up to date.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Teachers will and should continue to play a major educational role, however, but now they can spend more time as a coach, tutor, assessor, integrator, organizer, etc. and less time as a deliverer of information.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Another development finding its way into the school system elsewhere is the emergence of charter schools. Such schools operate quite independently from the normal school system although are expected to meet established school standards. The experience with charter schools is still quite limited but they continue to emerge as an additional way to deliver education. The increase in the number of students enrolled in private schools and home-schooling programs also speaks to the issue of finding alternative ways to meet educational objectives.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>It may now be possible to bring a number of these ideas together in order to address the concerns and issues which have emerged about the future of small schools on PEl. The idea, obviously, requires careful review and planning. One alternative, for example, would be to establish a 'charter style' school in one or more of the affected communities. This should be undertaken on a pilot basis before any decision is made either to close schools or simply to continue them on the existing model.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>It is likely that the current model of serving small schools is neither affordable nor workable. Perhaps the same dollars spent differently could ease the situation. Spending differently may mean a different approach to staffing (more part time teachers for example) additional and different instructional materials,, greater access to computers and networks, more independent study and even distance education.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The result of these changes, however, may allow small schools to deliver a quality education in at least some of our small communities.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
<p><br></p>
