  2016-5 Schoools Act  
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Don critiques PEI&#x27;s new Education Act, arguing it&#x27;s misnamed (Schools Act, not Education Act) and focuses on efficiency over effectiveness. He identifies multiple deficiencies: no education definition, inflexible teacher/principal credentialing, centralized decision-making contrary to OECD research, and policies contradicting student-centered principles. He advocates for flexibility (noting Australian Catholic systems don&#x27;t require teacher principals), school autonomy in daily decisions including budget allocation, and student-centered policies like exemptions and remedial support referenced by Dean Goddard and Finnish models.</div>

<p>Dear Editor:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><b>Education Act</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I read the new Education Act last weekend; I urge others to do the same.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It sets a framework for school operation during the next few years; based on my reading, the focus appears to be on efficiency rather than effectiveness.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>First, the Act is misnamed; it is a schools act not an education act, and there is a difference.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It appears that the Government believes that all education, or at least the education government is interested in, occurs only in schools; hopefully, some of the advisory councils will convince them otherwise.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>One would have expected an “Education Act” to define education; one would also expect a teacher to be defined by what teachers do rather than the “folded paper” they carry.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>While it makes sense for principals to come from the teaching ranks it should not be a requirement: the Catholic school system in Australia no longer requires that that all principals have been<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>teachers, and I’ve read about small schools that organize more like professional offices than traditional schools. Having flexibility is important.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>It is generally thought that schooling works best when teachers have the knowledge and autonomy to create appropriate learning experiences for children in their care.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In fact, the OECD, the initiator of PISA testing, found that students perform better when their schools have autonomy in everyday decision making, including some autonomy for allocating funds; my own experience supports that view.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The Act, however, appears to reserve all decision-making for the Minister; good management practice delegates decision making much further down the line.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>While agreeing that teachers should encourage “students in their pursuit of learning”, I find it hard to square that statement with stories by students of sitting in class day in and day out while work they have already mastered is explained to others, of students who at one time were eligible for “exemptions” but, in spite of Dean Goddard’s recommendation, no longer have that option, and of young people being counselled into lower level courses rather than being provided the extra bit of help needed, as Finland has found possible.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Minor as these appear, such simple steps would serve notice to students that the system does have their interests at heart.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>While the government of the day did not create current educational conditions, government is the only body with the wherewithal to correct them; we’re still waiting.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Don Glendenning</p>
