  D Ready for School
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Don argues that early childhood development is critical, with families as first teachers. He proposes family-focused educational services similar to medical advice for parents with young children. He challenges the focus on preparing children for school, arguing schools should instead adapt to serve children&#x27;s developmental needs.</div>

<p>Dear Sir:</p>
<p><b>Ready for School</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Education is a life long process.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Pr5oviding each child with a good education is a worthy objective; school is a means to that end.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But, education begins long before we start school and after we leave.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The early years are formative years; family members, especially parents, are the first teachers. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Much of what we become is the result of what we experience during our first five years.<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Coaching Many parents need, or at least would like help; it would be money well estedinvspent.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>When parents need professional advice on health matters they can consult a family physician or perhaps request a visit from a nurse.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Why not, therefore, a similar arrangement for advice on educational matters?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It would likely require a small team of practitioners with a background in early childhood development.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Such a service could well extend into family advice even for children in the early years of school.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Sometimes I think that we should pay more attention to preparing schools to deal with children rather than preparing schildren to deal with schools.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>After all,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>that is why we have schools<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>We hear a great del about parents preparing children for school, but shouldn’t we really be talking about preparing schools for children?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Both have the same objective, preparing children for life.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>After all, children are who they are.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>it be the reverse, prparents talking about getting their children read for school</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
<p><br></p>
