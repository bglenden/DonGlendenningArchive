  Purpose
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">A letter arguing that PEI lacks clarity about its educational purpose, a deficiency Don identifies as fundamental to system design. He notes that departmental literature references &quot;creating opportunities for student success,&quot; &quot;securing a place in society,&quot; and &quot;developing high quality programs,&quot; but argues these statements lack sufficient specificity for program design or results measurement. Don proposes that education&#x27;s purpose is helping people gain knowledge, skills, attitudes, and attributes for various life roles (citizen, family member, individual, student, consumer, producer), with citizen and employment contexts most frequently mentioned by Islanders. A clear purpose, Don argues, would direct organizational structure and provide focus for instruction and assessment, shifting teacher work from subject/grade delivery to enabling students&#x27; life role competence. He calls this &quot;purpose firm&quot; (quoting a Sunday School teacher) and urgently needed.</div>

<p>Dear Editor:</p>
<p>Our educational purpose</p>
<p>Purpose provides the fundamental reason for establishing an organization and is the key element in the structuring process; yet it is not clear<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>just what we are trying to accomplish through public education in PEI.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Department literature speaks of “creating opportunities for student success”, ‘helping students secure a place in society” and for the Dpartment of<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“developing and delivering high quality programs and curriculum.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>None of these seem to capture the role and spirit of what education is doing or needs to be done.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Neither do they provide sufficient detail on which to design programs or measure results.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There are likely more definitive statements but I did not find them.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Education is a field of service; it is intended to help people gain knowledge, skills, attitudes and other attributes important in life. Life itself, we are told, includes a number of roles including that of a citizen, family member, individual, student, consumer and producer. All roles deserve support. Based on my conversations with Islanders, citizen and employment “destinations” are suggested most often as preferred contexts. Either or both would provide an appropriate focus or context for public education. Readers interested in the subject may find interestind an aile on <span class="Apple-converted-space">      </span>schools in the New York times o September,4,2022.</p>
<p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>A clear purpose not only directs the organization. it provides a focus for instruction and assessment; Instead of simply teaching<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>a subject or a grade level, teachers would be helping students gain skills needed to function or thrive in life roles.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>In writing this letter, I am not saying that the Department doesn’t have a purpose for what it does but rather as now described, the purpose is not clear. To quote one of my Sunday School teachers of yesteryear, not only must we have “purpose firm”, we must also “dare to make it known”.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>A clear purpose is urgently needed and now is the time to make it known.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
<p><br></p>
