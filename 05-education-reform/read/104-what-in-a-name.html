<div class="reader-summary">Draft letter examining PEI&#x27;s education nomenclature and organizational structure. Don outlines his philosophy: education as experiences with formative effect, references OECD and Good&#x27;s Dictionary definitions, and criticizes the current Department structure for not reflecting functions performed. Calls for overarching principles in education policy and notes the gap between community expectations and educational services delivered. October 20, 2019.</div>

<p><b>Editor,</b></p>

<p><b>Charlottetown, PEI	</b></p>

<p><b>Dear Sir:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b>What we think, we are.</b></p>
<p><b>Framework</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>My view of education is very simple; education is the result of “experiences that have had a formative effect on the way I think, feel or act”.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If I need a more formal definition, I usually refer to the OECD view that education is “organic and sustained communication to bring about learning” or Good’s Dictionary which describes education as “the aggregate of all processes by which a person develops abilities, attitudes and other forms of behavior”.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>The above<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>are inclusive definitions; they cover people of any age; with any postal code, regardless of previous education or experience, for any life role and any length of time.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I cannot think of any Islander or educational process that would be excluded.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>While I expect that educati <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>taxpayers believe that education is important both for the “benefit” of individual Islanders and to ensure that PEI is the place we want to live, governments will offer encouragement and support .</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Unfrtunately my search for a clear direction was nit very successful</b></p>
<p><b>While I am sure<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Absence oof defintiond and <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>aboundsUnfortunately, my search of PEI education materials<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>failed to produ no doubt are a significant fuzzinessce a</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Unfcused descriptions any working definitions; the general kack of<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>unficused writing may, in fact, bee a significant factor inthis may explain the<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>general lack if ficus ondefinition or<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>any insight into the views of our education leaders.</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b><span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></b></p>
<p><b>Education is a responsibility of a Province; typical education services include information, counselling, instruction, education products, people with specialized training, money and <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The organization of the Department does not reflect funtions performed</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The many factors, presents organizational challenges One would expect to find a set of overarching or underlying principles such as:</b></p>
<p><b>Each student is expected to develop basic skills needed to function as a citizen in a democracy</b></p>
<p><b>Every citizen will have access to a personal or family advisor on educational matters, a person who may or may not also teach.</b></p>
<p><b>Every effort will be made to support individual learning interests and styles.</b></p>
<p><b>Improvement efforts appea focused on schools rather thn on<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>levels of achievement.of education levels or<span class="Apple-converted-space">      </span>education levels</b></p>
<p><b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Pei needs better defined levels of achievement in education</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Yje absence of such principles, contributes to ffhs hbcwetainty</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>It appears to me that the Island education system reflects quite a different and narrower view.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>For example:</b></p>
<p><b>Currently our Department operates as the “Department of Education and Life Long Learning.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The former Government operated as “The Department of Education and Early Childhood Development”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Education in Manitoba falls under the Department of Education and Training.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I could understand training, lifelong learning and early childhood being divisions of a Department of Education but the practice of<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>including them in the name is misleading. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b>When I read articles emanating from the Department of Education and Lifelong Learning it seems that education and the help provided in<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>school are virtually the same.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That view is at odds ith what I read in the education literature.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The functions of<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>an education are typically thought of as leadership. governance, funding, instruction, information, counselling, quality management and education products.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Most of our instruction takes place purpose built facilities (schools, colleges and universities) but the function is that of instruction.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We readily distinguish between agriculture and farming or health and hospitalization and believe that education deserves the same treatment</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>I believe that what we do generally reflects what we believe and educational practices seem to reflect definitions different from those given above.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And may well result in significant expenditure</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>ften hear about our silos- at least 4</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>There’s a gap between what the community expects and what the community gets in the way of education services, and the gap appears to be widening. It’s mostly about quality but with increasing frequency, it seems, dissatisfaction is being linked to rising costs.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>

<p><b>Role of Dept</b></p>
<p><b>Meanings</b></p>
<p><b>Under lying beliefs and principle</b></p>
<p><b>Island educators nevr seem to meet together</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>We up our education for many reasons – we want to increase or income, change jobs, be more mobile, understand our origins or surroundings, etc. etc. etc. many reasons are simply to meet our own circumstance and needs some reasons reflect the wishes or requirements of other; further education and education for paid employment fall under the latter.</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Employment preparatory courses us usually use employment-based criteria when performance, such as:</b></p>
<p><b>•	Quality</b></p>
<p><b>•	Quantity</b></p>
<p><b>•	 Problem solving</b></p>
<p><b>•	Leadership, and</b></p>
<p><b>•	Dependability</b></p>
<p><b>Some employment-based rating scales in-clude both assistance and supervision; rat-ing on academic subjects tends to be based on written tests. And, therefore, are less applicable to employment.</b></p>
