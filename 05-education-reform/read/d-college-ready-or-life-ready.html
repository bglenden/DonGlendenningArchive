  D  College Ready or Life Ready
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Don critiques the emphasis on &quot;college readiness,&quot; arguing that education&#x27;s ultimate goal is preparing people for life beyond school. He reframes college preparation as an interim step, not the end goal, and emphasizes that schools should equip students with diverse skills for multiple life roles. He calls for substantive public debate about educational objectives and expresses frustration at the absence of community dialogue on fundamental educational questions, positioning citizens as stakeholders entitled to voice their perspectives.</div>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">The
New York Times on Tuesday, February 8 declared that “Most New York
Students are Not College Ready”; in fact, according to the article,
the percentage of “college ready” high school students is
decreasing.  I am sure that many educators on PEI would feel the same
about Island students.  I have some problems with that line of
thinking.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">The
ultimate goal of education is to prepare people for life outside
school.  For some, that will occur at the end of high school; for
others, that comes after further study.  Preparation for life outside
school is not something to be added or completed just before
graduating.  It is an integral part of all one’s education</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">But
the preparation is pPreparing students for college or university is
an interim goal; the ultimate goal of education, including schooling,
is to prepare for life outside school. For some, that will take place
at the end of high school, for others  That is not to exclude
preparing for college but even preparing for college is also only an
interim step; how well we do that is the ultimate measure of the
success of our education system.  
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">People
in the education system now will ultimately move out of the “student
role” in school, college  or university and into other life roles. 
Schools should help with the transition and provide a variety of
skills used in later life.  There is little doubt in my mind about
the importance of our schools, colleges and universities in helping
students prepare for these life roles but the detail of what they
should do and how the should do it would, I am sure, produce both a
variety of views and some lively discussion.  But it is a debate we
should have.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">I am
struck by the absence of public debate about important educational
issues and urge readers to enter the dialogue.</p>
