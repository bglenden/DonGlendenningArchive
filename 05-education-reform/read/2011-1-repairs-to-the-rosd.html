  2011-1 Repairs to the rosd
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Don uses infrastructure metaphor to argue education needs major systemic repairs beyond incremental improvements. He identifies two critical areas: educational outcomes must be clear, unambiguous, and measurable (arguing many PEI language arts outcomes fail this test), and teacher certification should be skills-based rather than credential-based. Don notes that PEITF agreements mention methodology and management but should include diagnosis, assessment, project management, counseling, and materials selection. He argues skills-based certification would have clarified kindergarten teacher qualification debates the previous year and contends needed reforms can occur at minimal cost without operational disruption.</div>

<p>Dear Editor:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Repairs to the Road to Education</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Calls for change in our school system are widespread; responses vary widely. Better report</p>
<p>cards, merit pay, extending the school day and more computers; all are useful and will likely</p>
<p>help, but may be likened to filling potholes on spring roads.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>From time to time roads need major repairs. Washouts occur, bridges become unsafe, curves</p>
<p>may need straightening, wet spots need draining and sometimes new stretches have to be built</p>
<p>from scratch. The same applies to the road to education. Below are a couple of spots that need</p>
<p>more than a few shovels of asphalt.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Educational outcomes are the basis for curriculum development but outcomes need tobe clear, unambiguous and measurable. I browsed some for the PEI language arts outcomes recently and find that than many outcomes do not pass the test, or at least my grading of that test. Outcomes are central to the teaching/learning process and should determine the what, when and where of a teacher's daily, monthly and yearly teaching plans. Those same outcomes should form the basis for reporting student progress. Some redesign, new materials and fresh signage is called for.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The skills of teaching should be used as the basis of teacher certification. That's not to say that teachers lack teaching skills but it appears that no one checks them out. As far as I can tell, teacher certification is based on subjects studied and not on what has been learned. lt's time to update the certification system. The PEITF agreement mentions two skill areas, methodology and management, but the list should include diagnosis, assessment, project management, counseling, selection and modification of learning materials, etc. lf a skills-based certification process had been in place last year when kindergartens were being merged into the school system, the debate as to what constitutes a qualified teacher would likely not have even occurred.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Responsibility for the above repairs rests clearly with the Department of Education and, I should point out, can be carried out at minimal cost and interference with the ongoing operation of the system. No doubt, some major repairs are also needed but l'll leave those for another letter.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
<p><br></p>
