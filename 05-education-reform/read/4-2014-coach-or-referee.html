  4-2014 Coach or referee
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Don argues that teachers cannot fairly perform dual roles of coach (teacher) and referee (assessor) simultaneously. The coaching/teaching role suffers when teachers must also rank students. He proposes establishing an independent qualification authority (like the Royal Conservatory or apprenticeship programs) to award credentials separate from instruction. This separation maintains coaching while ensuring fair, objective assessment.</div>

<p>Dear Sir:</p>
<p><b>Conflict of interest?</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>It’s not fair to students for teachers to both teach and rank (referee) their own students; teaching and ranking, like coaching and refereeing, are separate roles and should be treated as such.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Performing both roles with the same students places a teacher in a position of conflict and, based on my experience, it’s the coaching/teaching role that suffers.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The role of teachers is to help students learn; like a coach, they provide a variety of support including that of instructing, assessing, mentoring, facilitating, advising, fact finding and many others.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As part of the process, teachers test, diagnose and assess each student; the results are, or should be, used to plan new strategies to help learners; in school, all can win.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Referees, on the other hand, are involved with competitions, they enforce rules they use many of the same tools as teachers but they apply them for a different purpose; the referee’s role is to determine who wins, and there is only one winner in each game. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Ranking and competition are part of life; students must learn to deal with them but schooling itself is not a competition.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And when the competition ends and the winner announced, teachers deal with the consequences for each player.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The solution may be to establish separate body, a qualification authority, to award credentials and qualifications.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That’s the model used for students of music, and for apprentices.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Why not for other subjects?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There is no doubt in my mind that an independent qualification authority would be fairer or students.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Comments from coaches and referees, whether or not they teach, are always welcome.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
<p><br></p>
