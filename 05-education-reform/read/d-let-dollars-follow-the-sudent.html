<div class="reader-summary">Don proposes specialized education clinics modeled on healthcare delivery (dental clinics, knee clinics), particularly for reading instruction. He advocates for clinics that would assess reading problems, create learning plans, and operate on fee-for-service bases. This letter shows his tendency to draw analogies across sectors and his interest in market mechanisms and specialization. He extends the concept to other skill areas, reflecting belief that education could benefit from medical model approaches to diagnosis and treatment.</div>

<p>Dear Sir:</p>
<p>Should Dollars Follow Students?</p>
<p>A Globe and Mail article on October 07 carried a story about the Calgary knee clinic; early results show that both wait times and unnecessary tests have been reduced.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>While reading the article, I began to wonder if there was a place in our education system for specialized clinics.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Reading comes quickly to mind, it being such a key skill, but there are certainly other possibilities as well.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In most of my encounters with parents whose children are still in the school system, reading seems to be the number one concern but a clinic could also serve adults. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>My thinking is for a clinic in the mainstream, not for research, actually putting into practice that which we already know about fluency, grammar, comprehension, spelling, vocabulary and other factors that may limit one’s ability to read. Staffed by one or more specialists and support staff, clinics would assess reading problems, identify needs and create learning plans. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>While reading is not my specialty, why couldn’t a reading clinic, operating much like a dental or eye clinic, be open to any Islander either directly or by referral <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>and operate on a fee for service basis? <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Some universities now have reading clinics but their primary interest seems to be research. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Readers are invited to comment at standards2020@gmail.com<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
<p>Don Glendenning</p>
<p>A long-time student of education</p>
