  D-18 Management problem  
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Glendenning asserts that PEI&#x27;s educational challenges are fundamentally management problems, not resource problems—more teachers, higher salaries, or technology won&#x27;t resolve them. He applies organizational principles to education: &quot;form follows function,&quot; requiring functional analysis and organizational alignment. He identifies education&#x27;s functions as governance, financing, delivery, human resources, and information. The Department lacks clear, measurable purpose—its 1989 philosophy statement is outdated with unmeasurable goals. Leadership needs a short, clear statement repeated consistently. Additionally, the Department masquerades as serving &quot;education&quot; while focusing solely on schooling, limiting students to opportunities it conceives and manages rather than fostering broader learning opportunities.</div>

<p>Dear Sir:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><b>It’s a management problem</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The school system has a management problem; we could double the number of teachers and een double their salaries, require all teachers to have PhD’s, build new schools, add dozens of new courses and install the latest technology, and we would still be faced<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>with the same issues<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>One of the principles of organization is that of “form follows function” yet my sesrch of the literature found no mention of educational functions. is still a sound principle of organizational planning.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In the absence of a functional analysis, I created one; here’s my latest version for rducation: financw, governance, delivery. products and technology, drlivery some label this instruction) human resources and information. A second principle of management suggests that organizations work best when there is a high correlation between the functional structure and the actual organization.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In the case of our Department, there isn’t.</p>
<p>Effective organizations have clear purposes; the Department’s purposes are fuzzy and out of date. The “philosophy of education” found on the Department of Education website was approved in 1989.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I believe that such statements are important, in fact, I often refer to the existing one when preparing notes on education.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The document needs updating.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The language is out dated and many, and perhaps most, goals are not measurable.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In its place, the Department needs a short, clear statement of purpose repeated often by the leadership but understood by all. Such a statement will be direction-setting for members of the Department but will also assure the public that the organization knowsa what it’s about.</p>
<p>A third issue is that of focus; the Department masquerades as a Department of Education when, in fact, ii is focused almost solely on schooling.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The needs to shed operational responsibilities and focus on leadership.building trust, encouraging trust, reducing fears, creating a colture of learning , sharing, engagement role of<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>the Department, I believe, is to seek out, encourage and even create learning opportunitits wherever and whenever they can be found. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In stead, our students and are limited only to the opportunities that the Department can conceive, deliver and manage and measure..<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I’ve talked with many<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Don Glendenning</p>
<p>A long-time student of education</p>
