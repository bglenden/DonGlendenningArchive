<div class="reader-summary">Lengthy draft on education services and teaching philosophy. Don categorizes typical education services (information, counselling, management, quality assurance, learning, technology, funding, human resources, data) and argues departments don&#x27;t make them separately available. Proposes shifting from school-based to learner-based education, especially in senior grades. Discusses the need for public conversation and community education forums.</div>

<p><b>Typical Education Services</b></p>
<p><b>Education is a service to people wanting help with their learning; surprisingly, Departments<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>do nor make them separately available. With increasing numbers of independent learners, however, I expect the demand will increase.</b></p>

<p><b>Teaching</b></p>
<p><b>People often need help with their learning; “teaching and educating” can be thought of as delivering that help. We usually think of delivering learners to a place of help but the reverse is also true. We can and should provide help to learners wherever they are.</b></p>
<p><b>That’s what an education system is. An education system is an organization that proviides help to learners. It organizes<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>support for learning of a kind and at a time convenient for learners. We did yhat during Covid; we need to cfinnd ways to ontinue it. ProviiConvening<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>learners in school is one alternative.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b>Learning is a personal matter; only the learner can learn but that learning can be in any<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>field, any place and at any time.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b>Although mention is frequently made of education systems in the education literature, my search f Departments Education in Canada only revealed school systems.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b>Perhaps we should consider a switch from school based education to learner based education, especially in the senior grades. there is no doubt in my mind that such a move add additional depth to public education.</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Di n’t little actu al helpXH Typical help for learners comes in the form of<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>information, counselling, analysis, instruction, and<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The organization and delivery of these services constitute an education systeyrchnology, as needed. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>While services can be delivered most anywhere, given the nature of the subject, the numbers involved and the cost, we often bring learners together in schools.</b></p>
<p><b>Over the years, schools played an important role in their community; they still do.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The <span class="Apple-converted-space">              </span>world, however changed. Education broadened and deepened beyond the “three Rs”. People needed and looked for education beyond day classes provided in the local school</b></p>
<p><b>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</b></p>
<p><b>Education</b></p>
<p><b>Education is an umbrella term. An education system brings together services, products and people dedicated to helping others learn; leadership is provided by Departments of Education who promote, encourage, support and regulate education for the whole community – all ages, all fields and all purposes. Sometimes the numbers involved, the nature of the subject<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>and the cost, call for separate facilities called schools, which, like a rink or a hospital, is a space designed, equipped, staffed and operated to support the education process.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b>The complexity of organized education is confusing; the emotionally laden content and long history doesn’t help.</b></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li1"><b>Purpose unclear</b></li>
  <li class="li1"><b>Structure focused<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></li>
  <li class="li1"><b>Accountabilities</b></li>

<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>So I turned to the pile of papers under my table looking for suggestionsfrequently tshink the same way. On reading this, I went through the literature and made a list of ways to increase the educational value of the school experience; I’d be glad to share the list. It would be an interesting topic for public discussion.</b></p>
<p><b>The OECD tells us that PISA results are better when schools have autonomy in their day-to-day operation. The Montreal Economic Institute also argues for autonomy and accountability at the school level.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>These are als</b></p>
<p><b>o items of likely interest.</b></p>
<p><b>A third item is about the matter of assessment and grading. The current grading system comes under substantial criticism as a measure of school success and a report on what has been learned. Should we consider others?</b></p>
<p><b>Given the importance of community participation in the education process, it may be time for PEI to stablish a forum for discussion of educational issues; they’ve done this in North Carolina; others simply have local education associations. The Conversation and the Hershberger institute are other approaches. Or perhaps CAMET or the CMEC could assume a leadership role in airing alternative and emerging ideas. Or perhaps we could create something new.</b></p>
<p><b>We need a conversation about education; here is my contribution. I look forward to hearing yours.</b></p>
<p><b>Sincerely</b></p>

<p><b>Conversation 1</b></p>
<p><b>the same. I’ve encountered that confusion on PEI.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b>Education is an act of helping someone learn something – a new skill, information, attitudes, values, insights etc, Schools are to organizing and supporting the learning process. Improving literacy would be an education topic;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Family and community involvement in the education process are key to its success. Both should be consulted and informed about education as well as schools. Although I support the appointment of school trustees, I must point out that most questions and criticisms I encounter are about education not schools – literacy, numeracy, student self-development, soft skills, making judgments, personal finance, employment preparation and the usual “ability to make change”. Our focus on schools acts as a screen for outdated education practices.</b></p>
