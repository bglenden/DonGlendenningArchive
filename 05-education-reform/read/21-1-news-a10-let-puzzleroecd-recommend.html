<div class="reader-summary">Letter dated May 21, 2018, analyzing PISA (Programme for International Student Assessment) results and OECD recommendations. Don notes Canada and PEI performed well on 2015 PISA tests measuring 15-year-olds&#x27; essential knowledge and skills. However, he highlights OECD&#x27;s 2011 finding that schools with greater autonomy over curriculum and assessment outperform others. References Quebec&#x27;s success attributed to combined autonomy and accountability (Montreal Economic Institute) and Japan&#x27;s approach (98% autonomy on evaluation policies, 89% on course content). Concludes PEI principals and teachers have minimal autonomy, calling it a &quot;puzzler&quot; why the province doesn&#x27;t implement these proven strategies.</div>

<p>Editor,</p>
<p>Charlottetown, PEI	</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Dear Sir:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><b>It’s a puzzler</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>I’ve just reread the 2015 PISA results. Canada did pretty well; so did PEI.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>PISA is the administered to 15 year- old’s to measure the extent to which they have mastered the knowledge and skills that are considered essential in a modern world.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Obviously, we would like to and could do better – In fact, the OECD itself tells us how to do better.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>To quote a friend, why we don’t follow OECD recommendations is a” puzzler”. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>OECD did a study of PISA results in 13 countries; in 2011 OECD reported that students from schools with greater autonomy about what is taught and how it is assessed perform better than others.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Quebec seems to do exceptionally well on such tests; the Montreal Economic Institute (MEI) attributes success in Quebec to a combination of autonomy and accountability of teachers and principals.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The MEI article also points out that in Japan, a top-ranking country in PISA rankings, principals and teacher are able to choose evaluation policies in 98 percent of cases and course content in 89 percent of cases.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The issue is not one of Provincial governments changing standards but rather of giving schools flexibility in how they reach them.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>On a number of occasions, I’ve enquired as to the level autonomy and accountability of PEI teachers and principals; from both what was said and what was avoided, it appears curriculum comes from the Department with little flexibility for change at the school level.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The Principals’ Council, at least in its first report, implies principals have little decision-making authority.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Implementing policies of autonomy and accountability at the school level sounds like a winner.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Why we don’t do so, like my friend says, is a puzzler.</p>
<p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
