  D 2014 Initiating change
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Don reflects on a community gathering of 35 people discussing education reform, noting recognition of needed changes, the persistence of issues, and rising public frustration. He suggests mathematics as a starting point for systemic reform, advocating for clarity on educational purpose (skill development, economic competitiveness, childcare), identification of required math competencies from multiple stakeholders, and structural changes to accommodate individual learning timelines. He emphasizes that the public possesses knowledge and capacity for reform without waiting for top-down mandates, calling for grassroots engagement and local ownership of solutions.</div>

<p>Dear Sir:</p>
<p><b>Initiating change<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Thirty five people gathered one evening last week to talk about the need for change in our education system.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Three things became obvious to me by the end of the evening, first, the people, at least those present, have a pretty good understanding of changes needed, second the need for these changes has been around for some time and, third, the frustration level is rising. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>So where do we start? There are dozens of places to start and each of us should start wherever we are and do whatever we can but, given the recent publicity about PTSA results and mathematics education, why not start with math.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I checked the Dept website, shools are expected o help prepare for work</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The power to change is in our hands; let’s not wait for those in the system.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Start the process yourself.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>here are some suggestions:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Become better informed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If you have a child in school, look at the outlines on the Department’s website; tst the program look at the pInform yoursBut collectively, why not join together to improve education in mathematics?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Let’s not wait for the systeBut we should not wait<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Part of the problem is that we, the public and educators alike,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>failWe’ve spent years building and operating the current system; it cannot and should not be changed over night.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>early on someone pointed out that many of the changes needed are structural.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>the very first one of the first peopcomments identified that many of dealt with the need for action not a further study. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>or ctively with our math concerns, we<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>first need to deal with the following questions:</p>
<p>Why do we want our schools to do?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It seems that they have three functions: (1) to help students gain the skills they need to function in, contribute to and enjoy the society the live in (2) to help the Province and country develop the people it needs to participate in a global economy. (3) Provide care for young people while parents work. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>What math skills are needed? Ask students, Ask the community, Ask employers. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>We need a clear statement to this effect or a different</p>
<p>Through our agent,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>students, our government, we establish and fund schools to provide specialized help to young people in gaining or improving skills needed throughout life. mathematics is included among the skills we fund.</p>
<p>Schools deliver instruction in mathematics to every student for 12 years; students are not allowed to finish early and receive credit; nor can they het help for a few extra days to get caught u.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>I’ve not found any evidence of minimum levels of performance required to receive a diploma.</p>
<p>Students, parents and taxpayers generally have very limited recourse if they are not satisfied with the results; they cannot change teachers, change schools, stop payment,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The school system defies all normal market conditions; governments require students to attend, decides what will be taught, by whom, where and for how long; it licenses teachers; then employs them text books <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As a result, there is no reason or incentive<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>to do better.</p>
<p>Withdraw services, seek another supplier, become more effective or efficient.</p>
<p>Because the government is also the employer, and governors are politicians, even small incident becomes a political issue and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Fail to separate what will be taught from how it will be taught.roles and functions, Teachers appear to believe that they decided</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
