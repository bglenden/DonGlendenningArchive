  Hyndman, Fred
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">This foundational letter outlines Don&#x27;s concerns about Canadian education and his vision for reform. He articulates problems including lack of teacher autonomy, insufficient accountability, and inadequate public information about education issues compared to health reporting. Don explains Education 20/20&#x27;s emerging strategy for change and emphasizes that success requires public demand. He directly solicits Hyndman&#x27;s partnership and financial support, noting that the Community Foundation of Prince Edward Island will administer donations. This letter exemplifies Don&#x27;s ability to synthesize complex educational issues and communicate them persuasively to business leaders.</div>

<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Dear Mr. Hyndman:		</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>As you may have gathered from my letters to the Charlottetown Guardian, I am concerned about the state of education in Canada.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I say this, based on my own experience, on what Islanders tell me, and what I read and hear. Without doubt, education is important, changes are needed, and there is wide support for change both inside and outside the system.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>It’s not easy to bring about change in any organization, and especially from the outside.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But it can and must be done.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Consequently, I’ve been working with a small group of Islanders who are of the same mind.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As a result, I am much more aware of the level of concern, required changes, and what can and should be done.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>One major change, for example, is to provide more autonomy and accountability to teachers and principals.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>While education systems are changing, changes fall short of what is actually required and fail to deal with a number of underlying weaknesses such as autonomy, accountability and engagement.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Furthermore, the required changes are not likely to happen unless the public, you and I, demand it. Traditional efforts to bring about change have not worked.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Some innovative, perhaps even bold, measures are required, but we think that a better education system is worth it.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Change is fuelled by information, however, we know that having information itself doesn’t guarantee change.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Compared with other services, education falls short in the amount of information available to users and the public.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Perhaps the most obvious comparison is with health where the media, on a daily basis it seems, carries items about cancer, diabetes, Alzheimers, the dangers of smoking as well as many other matters relating to our health.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We need that kind of attention to matters of education; practical information about early detection of reading problems, standards and independent study, to name but a few.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Better educational practices are known; we need to encourage their implementation; and of course, improvements need to be encouraged and reported.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Our group, <span>Education 20/20,</span> is just getting under way.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We’ve identified a strategy to encourage and enable change, held discussions with a variety of people to explore education issues, identified approaches and projects, and are ready to put ideas into action; some activities are already under way. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Our group cannot make this happen alone; we are now looking for partners and supporters.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We are pleased to be able to say that the Community Foundation of Prince Edward Island supports this educational initiative and will administer our funds.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Contributions<b> </b>to<b> Education 20/20 Inc</b>. should be directed to the Foundation (Community Foundation of Prince Edward Island, 119 Queen Street, Charlottetown, PE<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>C1A 4B3) who will issue charitable receipts.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>But we need your help as well – both encouragement and financial support. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I would welcome an opportunity to meet, to talk first about education, to hear your ideas and questions about education, and also to explore ways that you can help.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I’ll be in touch within the next few days seeking an appointment to talk further.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Don Glendenning</p>
<p>President</p>
