  D 2014 Entrepreneurship
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Don examines whether entrepreneurship can be taught in schools, drawing on research that identifies entrepreneurial students as autonomous, self-reliant, flexible, and tolerant of ambiguity—often appearing rebellious or emotionally aloof. He concludes that entrepreneurial spirit is personality-driven rather than skills-based, and that traditional classroom structures may suppress rather than cultivate entrepreneurial traits. The letter argues for pedagogical approaches that honor entrepreneurial students&#x27; psychological needs for independence and flexibility, suggesting that standard teaching methods are poorly suited to this student population.</div>

<p>Dear Sir:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Unlocking the entrepreneur <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p>.<span> </span>Unlocking Entrepreneurship</p>
<p>It has often been said that schools should teach entrepreneurship</p>
<p>PEI, and other provinces as well.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>To do so, we need entrepreneurs.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>At the Charlottetown market recently, I had a abrief conversation</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Goal of program was to teach entrepreneurial skills</p>
<p>Entrepreneurial spirit is more about personality<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>than skills</p>
<p>Teaching people to do the things that successful entrepreneurs do may not help</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Based upon the study results, a profile of the entrepreneurship student was developed. They tend to be more autonomous than others, possessing a high degree of self-reliance and self-determination. They may also be more rebellious and unmanageable, depending on the restrictions inherent in the situation. Entrepreneurial students tend to welcome change and new experiences, and they can be both flexible and unpredictable. They may often behave inconsistently when faced with routine situations.</p>
<p>These students tend to be very energetic and capable of intense work over long periods of time. They prefer impersonal to personal relationships and are often perceived as emotionally aloof. On the one hand, they are sometimes seen as unresponsive and as having difficulty relating to others. On the other, they may be seen as manipulative when persuading others to ahieve a particular goal. They appear to tolerate ambiguity well and feel little anxiety when faced with uncertainty.</p>
<p>In summary, entrepreneurship students can be depicted as independent individuals who dislike restraint, restriction, and the routine. They are capable of original thought, especially under conditions of ambiguity and uncertainty. Many of them need to develop better communication skills and to become more aware of how others perceive their behavior.</p>
<p>Using this profile of a typical entrepreneurship student, the authors developed a teaching method that enhances the students' positive characteristics, provides skills to overcome negative ones, and increases ...</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The idea of a course structure which reflects the student's psychological needs is not new. DeCarlo and Lyons suggested an educational system for entrepreneurs that "would be highly flexible and would reflect the individual entrepreneur's need for autnomy, independence, and freedom." Primary and secondary school teachers have long known that certain teaching behaviors are related to student achievement and learning gains. As Gage and Berliner note, "The characteristics and behaviors acquired by students before entering your class will surely affect what they are ready to learn and how they will learn it." the course structure reported here represents a significant departure from traditional classroom patterns, based on the author's belief that a new approach would result in a more effective entrepreneurship course.</p>
<p>Training of entrepreneurs can lead to higher profitsbut doesn’t seem to make people more entrepreneurial</p>
