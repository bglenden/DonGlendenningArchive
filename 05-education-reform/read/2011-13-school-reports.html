  2011-13 School Reports
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Don critiques school report cards designed for post-secondary institutions rather than employers, noting that help-wanted ads emphasize skills (problem-solving, communication, teamwork, project management) largely absent from academic transcripts. He observes schools organize instruction around disciplines while colleges/universities do likewise, creating university-focused reporting systems. Don proposes schools and employers collaborate with colleges/universities to design comprehensive report cards including both subjects and transferable skills. He argues employer engagement would be valuable even without format agreement, advancing dialogue among stakeholders about educational deliverables.</div>

<p>Dear Sir:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>School Reports</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Each level of schooling should prepare students to enter the work force or to move to the next level of</p>
<p>education.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Schools, however, seem to tailor report cards to the needs of postsecondary institutions; I</p>
<p>am not sure why the information needs of employers are overlooked.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Schools organize instruction around disciplines or subjects. Teachers assess and report student progress</p>
<p>in the form of a letter or number grade on each subject whether it be history, biology, music,</p>
<p>electronics, biotechnology, or any other. Since colleges and universities also organize instruction in the</p>
<p>same way, the high school reporting system appears to provide the information they need to accept or</p>
<p>reject students into further studies.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>"Help wanted ads", on the other hand, list skills needed or practiced in the workplace, such as the ability</p>
<p>to solve problems, perform analysis, communicate with others, work independently, manage projects,</p>
<p>negotiate contracts, operate heavy duty equipment, or install windows and doors. (The Grant Thornton</p>
<p>advertisement in the Guardian of Wednesday, August 3,2011 is a good example.) School report cards</p>
<p>that l've seen are silent on the matter of skills, leaving employers without the benefit of ratings or</p>
<p>comments.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>It's time, it seems to me, and for employers, colleges and universities to get together with schools to</p>
<p>design a report card that includes both subjects and skills. lt is in employers interests to take the first</p>
<p>step; such a dialogue would be useful even if the parties involved cannot agree on a common format.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Comments welcome at standards2020@smail.com</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
<p><br></p>
