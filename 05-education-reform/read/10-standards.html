  10 Standards
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Commending PEI&#x27;s kindergarten program introduction, Glendenning distinguishes between occupational standards (what one can do) and educational standards (disciplinary knowledge), arguing that standards should be performance-based, not credential-based. He opposes paying people for credentials rather than demonstrated capability and advocates establishing occupational standards based on actual kindergarten teaching tasks. He warns against squeezing out capable teachers lacking degrees, and calls for assessing ability to perform actual job functions—a principled stance on merit-based employment.</div>

<p>Charlottetown, PEI</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Dear Editor:</p>
<p>Standards</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I read with considerable interest recent media reports about the introduction of a kindergarten program</p>
<p>in Prince Edward lsland and want to commend the government for introducing it. I also commend the</p>
<p>students in the Early Childhood Education Program at Holland College for their initiatives in bringing</p>
<p>their concerns to the attention of the public.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The purpose of this note, however, is to comment on the issue of standards for kindergarten teachers.</p>
<p>There appears to be confusion as to what constitutes a standard; many people think that having a</p>
<p>degree or diploma constitutes an occupational standard; it doesn't. We may make a degree or diploma</p>
<p>an,entrance requirement but neither addresses the issue of how well a person performs in an</p>
<p>occupation.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Standards for kindergarten teachers should be based on the things kindergarten teachers do such as</p>
<p>assess language skills, assess social development, organize individual and group activities, provide child</p>
<p>care, communicate with parents, etc. Occupational standards attest, or should attest, to how well a</p>
<p>teacher can perform these and many other tasks.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Educational standards, on the other hand, are based on the study of a discipline - mathematics,</p>
<p>literature, technology, etc. Educational and occupational standards could be the same but they seldom</p>
<p>are. They tend to have different objectives and start from different bases.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I do not support the view that people should be paid because they hold a certificate, diploma or degree;</p>
<p>people should be paid for what they do, not for what they know. lt is hoped that people will perform</p>
<p>better if they know more but we shouldn't assume that to be the case.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The introduction of a kindergarten program provides an excellent opportunity to establish occupational</p>
<p>based standards for staff. To do this, we must identify the kinds and levels of performance required and</p>
<p>assess the extent to which prospective teachers meet those standards.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>We have an opportunity to implement a new, progressive and I think, better approach to the standards</p>
<p>setting process - a set of standards based on a person's ability to do the job. Let's not waste an</p>
<p>opportunity by focussing on whether or not a person has a diploma or degree. Worse still, let us not</p>
<p>squeeze out, under pay or otherwise penalize good kindergarten teachers because they do not have a</p>
<p>degree.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
<p><br></p>
