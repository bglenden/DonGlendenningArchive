  2013-03 Remedial Math
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Critiquing the label &quot;remedial&quot; in educational contexts, Don argues the term implies student fault and carries stigmatizing effects potentially lasting throughout life. Drawing on personal medical experience where receiving corrective treatment didn&#x27;t result in labeling, Don questions whether remedial math instruction differs fundamentally from regular instruction or merely employs different teaching methodology for different learner needs. He contends careful labeling practices—especially for young students—protect long-term potential. The letter demonstrates Don&#x27;s attention to psychological and social impacts of educational language.</div>

<p>Dear Sir:</p>
<p><b>Remedial Mathematics</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>In conversation a few days ago, a friend mentioned remedial math; while “remedial” is not unique to schooling, it appears to be more common there than in other fields of endeavour. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The internet tells me that remedial is “an action taken to remedy a situation”; seems to me, therefore, that all math instruction is remedial since it is intended to remedy a deficiency, Labeling a course as “remedial” or a student as being in a remedial course, casts a shadow over a student and implies that it is the student’s fault. No doubt the word will get entered in the student’s record and may be a negative influence in later life.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I visited a doctor a few months ago; he prescribed some pills; the condition continued and I went back to another doctor; he gave me a new prescription.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The condition cleared up.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Using the math example, I was in a remedial health program and didn’t know it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The second doctor may have been a “remedial doctor”, but he was not called that in my presence; my record remains clear. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Now, I don’t know much about math, or the teaching of math, but I doubt that the desired outcome or actual content is different between remedial and regular math.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>So it must be different teaching methodology, perhaps an approach to teaching for people who have been exposed to but haven’t learned math at an earlier stage of education.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>One wonders if the approach to teaching remedial math would be a better approach to teaching all math.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>While this letter may appear to be about mathematics, it really is a plea to be careful with labeling students, especially in their early stages of life; labels have a habit of sticking and coming back to haunt us, and we don’t want that to happen to our students. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Whether or not you agree, send your comments to me at<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>HYPERLINK "mailto:standards2020@gmail.com" <span>standards2020@gmail.com</span><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
<p><br></p>
