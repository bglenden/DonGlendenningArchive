<div class="reader-summary">Introductory course descriptions for Education 2020&#x27;s coding and robotics programs. Emphasizes that computer literacy and coding skills are essential for tomorrow&#x27;s citizens, teaching mathematical thinking and problem-solving. Notes 25-hour introductory coding course and separate robotics program covering mechanisms, dynamics, intelligent controls, and practical applications. Demonstrates Don&#x27;s forward-thinking approach to education reform and commitment to preparing students for technology-driven future.</div>

<p><span><b>Coding</b></span></p>
<p>Our world is dominated by software, a language that tells a computer how to perform complex tasks. Anyone can learn to “speak” computer coding and once you know how to code, you can create virtual worlds.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We want to put this power into the hands and hearts of every Islander.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Tomorrows citizens will be considered illiterate without having the ability to code. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Learning to code involves mathematics, logic and algorithms and teaches a new way of thinking, it teaches one how to tackle large problems by breaking them into small steps.</p>
<p>Our introductory course in coding is of 25 hours duration…</p>

<p><span>Robotics</span></p>
<p>We also offer an introductory course in robotics</p>
<p>Robotics and automation is an expanding field, a field that <b>creates flexibility; part of its growth comes from an evolution in the sensitivity of sensorsit is an expanding field sepecially because of the evolution of sensors</b></p>
<p>are expanding, thanks to a convergence of technological breakthroughs. Sensors have evolved, allowing machines to become more aware of their environment. This enables them to handle new tasks and operate in new places. Smaller and more powerful controllers and processors—and the power of cloud computing—have helped machines become more flexible and cheaper.<br>
<br>
Our introductory courrse in robotics<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>This course provides an overview of robot mechanisms, dynamics, and intelligent controls. Topics include planar and spatial kinematics, and motion planning; mechanism design for manipulators and mobile robots, multi-rigid-body dynamics, 3D graphic simulation; control design, actuators, and sensors; wireless networking, task modeling, human-machine interface, and embedded software. Weekly laboratories provide experience with servo drives, real-time control, and embedded software. Students will design and fabricate working robotic systems in a group-based term project.</p>
