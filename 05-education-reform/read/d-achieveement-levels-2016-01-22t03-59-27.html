<div class="reader-summary">Don argues that the public school system&#x27;s grading practices have become confusing and lack integrity, allowing students to graduate with high school diplomas without achieving grade 12 level work. He proposes adopting &quot;level&quot; terminology instead of &quot;grade&quot; to describe achievement, as used by International Baccalaureate, PISA, P-CAP, and qualification frameworks worldwide. This would allow students to progress through subjects at different achievement levels according to their mastery rather than age-based groupings.</div>

<p>Editor,</p>

<p><br></p>
<p>Dear Sir:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><b>Integrity of the public school grading system</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The fact that a Grade ten student is doing Grade six math is confusing; given this, it is seems possible that students could graduate from high school and be awaeded a high school diploma without really having successfully achieved a Grade 12 level on any subject. This is confusing to say the least but also calls into question the meaning of graduation and a graduation diploma. Social promotion and the new report cards, are beginning to assume the characteristics of a shell game.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The simple resolution is to adopt a separate term for draling with achievement; in fact, some have already made the shift. The International Baccalaurte program<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>reportd subject levels, so does the Canadian Conservatory of music as does PISA uses six proficiency levels, the Province refers to key stages, P-CAP has 4 levels,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>the Conference Board of Canada uses letter grades when referring to Provincial rankings on educaton and skills.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Many countries have developed qualification framework. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>If only to improve communication with studentds and psrentd, I urge the swithch , and do it soon</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>It’s time to select a different word to identify levels of achievement; but, “level” appears to be the preferred word. Changing the term would allow a student to study any subject at any level.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As a result, a grade 11 student could be taking level 7 math, level 4 physics and level 6 literature. The International Baccalaureate program does it, the Canadian Red Cross does it for swimming, some qualification authorities do it, and so should the public school system.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Each competency</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Don Glendenning</p>
<p>A long-time student of education</p>
