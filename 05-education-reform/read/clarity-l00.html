CALL FOR CLARITY</b></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 108%">											</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 108%">Some
time ago, I set out to explore public education with a view to
increasing my knowledge and understandings. Education is complex;
information plays a key role.  Learners have different interests,
experiences, capabilities and needs; they also fill a variety of life
roles.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 108%">.
 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 108%">The
conclusions that follow are based on my own experience, exploration
of literature, agendas and minutes, conversations and review of
school websites. 
</p>
<ul>
	<li><p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0in">In
	a report in 2018, the World Bank reminded us that education and
	going to school are not the same. Education is a service; school is
	a place. School and schooling may also be thought of as a pattern of
	help for learners.  Experiences in school are major contributors to
	one’s education but it is the experience not the school that
	counts.  It is like the preparation of the food rather than the
	management of the restaurant.</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0in">Governments
	usually structure around branches or fields. PEI Agriculture lists
	its divisions as land, water, crops, animals, etc. Health is
	organized around primary care, drugs, Covid, hospitals, etc. The
	Department of Education should focus on areas of learning such as 
	math, science, and self management rather than running schools.</p></li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li><p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0in">The
	PEI Department uses  “Education and Early Years” in title;
	doesn’t education include early years?</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0in">Documents
	refer to helping young people “secure a place” in society; what
	do we mean by “a  place”?; what criteria would one use to design
	a program or assess progress?</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0in">The
	Department refers to its role as one of “developing and delivering
	programs”; the literature normally describes the role as one of
	helping people gain “skills, knowledge and attitudes needed to
	thrive in future years? The two are not the same.</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0in">Recently
	I decided to check the PEI “Education Act” for deinitins. 
	Imagine my surprise to find that PEI no longer had a definition. 
	Thinking it was my inability to use the current technology, I phoned
	the Legislative Library for help.  The Libarian was most helpful but
	failed to produce a definition. Later I learned that “education”
	had been dropped from the act in favour of “school”. I find it
	strange indeed that a Department as large and complex as “education”
	lacks a simple definition.</p></li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 108%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 108%">Conceptual
clarity is a must to understand the people we serve, the services we
provide, learner needs, product, processes and values especially when
the subject carries layers of subjectivity.  Perhaps the Department
could produce and circulate a list of standard definitions.
