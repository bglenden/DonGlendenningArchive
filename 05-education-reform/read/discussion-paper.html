  discussion paper
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">An April 5, 2013 discussion paper addressing newsletter development for Education 20/20 Inc., proposing &quot;Open Education&quot; as the publication name. The document discusses committee structure and recommends assigning newsletter leadership to specific individuals (Eileen mentioned as potential committee chair, with Don offering interim chair role until schedules ease). Notes the upcoming website launch and discusses newsletter format (one to two pages with electronic distribution), proposed fresh weekly content items, and plans for occasional papers on focused educational topics.</div>

<p><br>
<b>Background:</b></p>
<p>We’ve agreed that we should have a newsletter; we even proposed to name it “Open Education”.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Our website is about to come on stream and we have Terms of Reference for an information committee, to include a newsletter.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Time is right, it seems, to clarify our thinking.</p>
<p><b>Committee</b></p>
<p>We agree that our Committee sis broad-based<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>suggest that we proceed quickly to name members to our Committee; this is a natural for you, Eileen, but we do not want to overload you.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Are you interested?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Is it something that you would take on after the Award process is finished?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I’d be happy to act as chair until your schedule eases.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>nks to Eileen and Maureen, this note turns to the form and content of a newsletter.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Given the work that Eileen and Maureen have done already on the website, ken's agreement to help, and the upcoming meeting with Ken on Tuesday,  I am assuming that we will soon have an operating website.  My attention is turning now to the generation of information.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>I know that this follows into your area of expertise, Eileen, I have a very larege file of items from newspapers and I could b.  My understanding is that you will be our webmaster but given our schedules, I'd like to set the initiative in motion</p>
<p><br>
Here's my thinking at  at the moment:</p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li8">Based on our earlier conversations we will have a one or two page newsletter with its own masthead.  It will be primarily electronic but a person could copy if interested.</li>
  <li class="li8">During the discussion last evening, someone mentioned a short item posted weekly about something happening elsewhere;In terms of the your website format, Eileen, it would mean a fresh item in the centre space below the photo.   for example, I have quite a large file of items taken from the web  and media that lend themselves to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li8">I think there is a place for occasional papers; the paper  on reading, when completed and polished,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li8">Announcements, links, etc.</li>
</ul>
