  What standards
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Don critiques the current grading system and proposes improvements to competency-based occupational standards. He questions what letter grades actually communicate about student capability and advocates for standards that measure individual performance against real-world occupational criteria. He emphasizes that standards should focus on &quot;how well one does it&quot; not just &quot;what one can do,&quot; establish multiple performance levels rather than artificial divisions, and incorporate professional judgment rather than seeking mechanical sorting. Don argues standards are separate from training and should be based on actual employment performance criteria like dependability, work quality, and team collaboration rather than credential possession.</div>

<p><b>Standards:<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The Unexplored Frontier</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>What’s an A?</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Our system of reporting student achievement or performance doesn’t tell us very much about what the student can do; unless, that is, one is selecting students for further study. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>People often refer to a good student as an “A’ student but that doesn’t tell me very much – at lest not very much in terms of what the student can do</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>An “A” or a 75% on engllish does not tell me very much</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I’ve been reading, talking and thinking about competency-based occupational standards and I have no yet found a model I like–at least, not one that fits my views. (I know that I am repeating earlier columns but I view standards as “the next frontier”, I promise, this will be my last column on the subject.)</p>
<p>Standards could be dramatically improved by these changes:</p>
<p>Taking a more individual focus;</p>
<p>Treating standards as a completely separate issue from training;</p>
<p>Basing standards on performance criteria applied in the occupation;</p>
<p>Focusing on output not input;</p>
<p>Establishing levels of performance for each competency; and</p>
<p>Allowing more opportunity for assessor judgment.</p>
<p>The difference in level o performance between two people in the same occupation results from (1) the ranged of tasks each can perform, and (2) the level of performance eon each competency.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This is the essence of standards.</p>
<p>It is taken for granted that only individuals learn; they may learn in a group setting but groups do not learn.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The same applies to standards.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Individuals meet, fail or surpass standards.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They may do so as part of a group, but it isn’t the group which meets the standards.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is a number of individuals.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We can draw conclusions about a group from individual results but we must continue to focus on what each participant is expected or is able to do.</p>
<p>Standards are not an extension of training; standards are a completely separate topic.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When dealing with the issue of standards, training should not even enter the conversation.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Implementing standards is a sorting process, pure and simple.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Grandfathering, often a part of standards, is a political or social issue and not a standards issue.</p>
<p>The criteria used to judge performance in an occupation should be the ones used to sort people for the purpose of standards such criteria will likely include dependability, quality of work, ability to work as a team member, time required to complete a task, etc.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A rating scale with 100 divisions is ludicrous; it is impossible to distinguish so finely.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Professional wisdom suggests a maximum of seven.</p>
<p>Having a degree, diploma or certificate is not a performance criteria for standards based on competence.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Having such documents, or proof of experience, may provide useful evidence as part of the assessment process but should not be construed as performance criteria.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The same applies to graduation form an accredited training institution.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Such evidence may increase the chances of meeting competency based standard but is evidence and not a performance criterion.</p>
<p>I’ve looked at examples of standards; most were based on competencies and/or tasks.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The weakness, I found, is the undue emphasis on separating levels of performance by what one does rather than how well one does it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As a result, competencies are divided, often artificially into smaller and smaller actions.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They fail to deal adequately with the issue of a differing levels on the same competency.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>These examples appear to be based on the view, erroneous I believe, that a level of performance eon a competency in one occupation is equal to the same level on a company with the same name in another occupation.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This is seldom if ever the case.</p>
<p>Finding a sorting process which does not include an element of judgment appears to be a “holy grail” for those engaged in setting standards.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It can’t be done; time should not be wasted on trying to do it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Recognize judgment as an integral part of the standards process and develop a support system to increase the reliability of judgment-making process.</p>
<p>Based on my review and reflection, I believe the components of a competency based occupational standard to be:</p>
<p>A competency based occupational analysis using practitioner as resource people;</p>
<p>A profile drawn from the analysis which identifies the key competencies;</p>
<p>A rating scale which reflects the criteria used to sort people in the real world, the occupation;</p>
<p>A benchmark position which is widely and readily recognized; and</p>
<p>A sampling system which provides consistent and credible results.</p>
<p>In order to achieve competency based standards, we must have a clear image of how the system will operate; my vision is a simple one.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The standards process is triggered by an individual making an application for certification.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Without knowing<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>anything about his or her previous life experiences including training, what would we have the person do in order for us to conclude that our standards have been met.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Start with a system as it relates to an individual; later, one must consider how to organize the system to accommodate large numbers.</p>
<p>	</p>
<p><i>Individuals meet, fail or surpass standards.</i></p>
<p><i>They may do so as part of a group, but it isn’t the group which meets the standards.</i></p>
<p><i>It is a number of individuals.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></i></p>
