  IT Training
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">A proposal for delivering 21st century information technology (IT) skills training to students through Education 20/20 Inc. Identifies background challenges: IT skills are critical for modern economy but expensive and difficult for schools to maintain current technology, teachers struggle to keep up, school time is limited, parents cannot keep current, and equipment sits unused after hours/weekends. Proposes training in local communities for children and young adults outside normal school hours and during summer. Options include credit or non-credit offerings, after-hours school facilities, library-based delivery, and fee-based or sponsored funding. Discusses integration approaches: 20/20 could secure funding and hire staff, or find funding and contract with providers. Raises implementation questions about Education 20/20&#x27;s charitable status, whether IT training aligns with organizational priorities, and whether it conflicts with or supports core mission.
