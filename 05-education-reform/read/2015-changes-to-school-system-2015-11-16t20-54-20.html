<div class="reader-summary">Don analyzes the Premier&#x27;s announcement on learning and prosperity, observing that government is broadening its educational vision beyond schooling to encompass all Islanders. He identifies the Premier as the de facto &quot;First Minister of Education&quot; with delegated responsibilities to different ministers. Don notes the elimination of the English Language School Board will reduce flexibility but likely have minimal impact, and cautions that partnerships can obscure accountability while the Province retains sole operational responsibility for schools.</div>

<p>Editor,</p>
<p>Charlottetown Guardian</p>
<p>Charlottetown, PEI	</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Dear Sir:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Changes to the school system</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The Premier’s recent announcement on learning and prosperity places him clearly as the leader of change in Island education; we know where he is looking although it’s still unclear as to what he actually sees.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>While the councils should dramatically increase opportunities for voices to be heard, it does not necessarily follow that recommendations will be listened to. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>It seems safe, however, to conclude that:</p>
<p>Government is broadening its view of what constitutes education, a view that has a learning core and encompasses Islanders of all ages.</p>
<p>The Premier is the de facto “First Minister of Education” with Minister Perry in charge of public instruction and Minister Brown in charge of educational activities outside and beyond public schooling.</p>
<p>Dispensing with the English Language School Board reduces the government’s “wiggle” room and, by itself, will likely have little or no impact on the quality of education offered to students.</p>
<p>The term partnership raises cautions with me; while I believe in consultation, partnerships can be used to obscure accountability. While educating may be a partnership, the operation of schools is now the sole responsibility of the Province.</p>
<p>The next level of detail, hopefully, will give a clearer picture of what the future shape of education on PEI is likely to be.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Don Glendenning</p>
<p>A long-time student of education</p>
