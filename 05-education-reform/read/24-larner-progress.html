<div class="reader-summary">Letter to Charlottetown Guardian (September 2, 2018) signed by Don Glendenning, &quot;A long-time student of education.&quot; Addresses reporting learner progress and proposes rules of thumb for assessment including reference to Australian educator Gonski. Don articulates the problem of institutional silos in curriculum development and advocates for a common &quot;math map&quot; across schools, employers, and postsecondary institutions to enable better communication about competencies. He calls for leadership to unite stakeholders around shared assessment criteria and reporting.</div>

<p><b>September 2, 2018</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Editor,</b></p>
<p><b>Charlottetown Guardian</b></p>
<p><b>Journal Pioneer	</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Dear Sir:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b>Reporting learner progress<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Conveying information about student achievement in his/her studies is a complex matter.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is easy for institutions to describe the content they offer and the content a student studies; it is difficult, however, to describe what a student has learned and<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>can apply; and then here’s the matter of level - but we owe it to our students to try and to be honest in our efforts.</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>My rules of thumb for assessment would include:</b></p>
<p><b>An element of judgement; learned that from Gonski, an educator in Australia</b></p>
<p><b>Learning was demonstrated and not the result of paper tests</b></p>
<p><b>Benchmark is a person</b></p>
<p><b>Rating scale is dynamic</b></p>
<p><b>Differences in levels are clearly described and observable</b></p>
<p><b>Criteria reflect those found in a relevant life role</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span></b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>With this objective in mind, I’ve been part of a number of discussions during the past few months about transitions in math from school to work.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It quickly became obvious that there is a communication problem among institutions,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>primarily because each institution works independently in the development of the curriculum it offers. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b><b></b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Curriculum development starts, or should start, with an analysis or identification of skills practiced in the field or in the role for which learners are preparing; such statements are neutral; each can be studied at a number of levels. Decisions about how, when, where, to what level for what applications come later and depend on the interest and needs of users. Although I have a number of lists in my possession as I write, all are abbreviated and fail to tell the whole math story.</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Given the emphasis on transition, it may be timely for providers and users of math instruction (schools, employers and postsecondary institutions) to get together and develop a common math map – that is skills, outcomes or competencies tht make up the field.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Such a map would ensure a common language of communication without impinging on anyone’s autonomy. With map in hand, profiles could easily be struck identifying each users’ requirements. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Part of the initiative could also benefit from a discussion of common assessment criteria, rating scales, benchmarks and reporting requirements. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>The problem is unlikely to solve itself; additional leadership is called for, some positive but light- handed direction or influence is needed to draw people out of their silos and into an exercise of helping students document what they know and can do. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Sincerely,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p><b>Don Glendenning<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
