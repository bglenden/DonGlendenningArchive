<p>Editor,</p>
<p>Charlottetown Guardian</p>
<p>Charlottetown, PEI	</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Dear Sir:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>What do we get for $225 million</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Education is a key to our individual and collective futures; the question is “What part should taxpayers pay for?”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My usual background sources weren’t very helpful but I believe it to be an important issue so I’ll venture some initial thoughts.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>By education, I mean those experiences that has a formative effect on the way we think, feel or act.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The difference between your education and mine is reflected, not in what or where we studied but in the range and levels of things that you can do with what you know. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>There is fairly broad agreement that government should pay for experiences that help develop good citizenship skills; that means help to develop a mix of appropriate or required attitudes, skills and knowledge.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The nature and level of help a student needs will depend, to a large degree, on<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>the previous experiences and imagined futures of each student, but everyone seems to agreethat students need a strong mix of basic skills. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Beyond that, there is not much agreement but self -management and relational skills appear to be high on the list.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>There is also a view, and one that I share, that schools should produce, and government should help pay for, the skills needed to maintain and enhance this community we call home, that would include our artists, health workers, skilled trades workers, farmers and fishers<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>to name but a few.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>On the other hand, government probably should help pay for school transportation but not through the school budget; transportation to a medicalclonic or to a hospital is a health care issue but, by and large, is not a hospital or clinic’s responsibility.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>One could also ask whether hungry children is a school issue, an education issue, a health issue and, of course whether or not schools need to provide care when n education A second is quality care while parents work, an important issue but not one that should<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>be foisted on schools, no matter how willing they are to accept it.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Don Glendenning</p>
<p>A long-time student of education</p>
