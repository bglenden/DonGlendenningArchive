  A Key Issues. 
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Comprehensive analysis of nine structural issues in PEI education: unclear purpose, undefined terminology, unidentified services, structure not matching function, lack of school autonomy, unclear accountability, insufficient collaboration, curriculum outcomes misaligned with life roles, and understated departmental role. Don argues these interconnected problems require structural reform and public discussion to resolve effectively.</div>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 108%"><b>The
literature speaks of the need for educational reform; the first
steps, I suggest, should   be structural. My exploration reveals the
ollowing:</b></p>
<ol>
	<li><p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0in"><b>Purpose
	not clear</b>-
	purpose<b> </b>sets
	the stage for what we do and how we organize to do it. The
	PEI education literature refers to helping people find a place in
	society; we need to better define that “place”.  Life roles have
	been described as that of an individual, citizen, a producer, a
	consumer, family member and student. All roles can benefit from
	education but all may not need the - same mix at the same time.
	That’s part of what makes service complicated.</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0in"><b>Terminology
	seldom defined – </b>The
	concept of “education and “school” are used interchangeably;
	World Bank cautions countries about this practice.</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0in"><b>Education
	services</b><b>
	</b><b>not
	identified </b><b>-
	</b>Education is a
	service. Typical education services include: information,
	counselling, instruction, products and technology, quality
	assurance. governance, funding and human resources; Learners may
	need any or all services at any point in their education journey and
	services should be front and center in our offerings. 
	</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0in"><b>Structure</b><b>
	</b><b>doesn’t
	match task </b><b>-”
	Form follows function” is still the standard when structuring any
	venture; one would expect, therefore, that the basic education
	structure would reflect services offered.  Instead, the Department
	appears to be structured around clients served.</b></p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0in"><b>Schools
	lack autonomy - </b><b>as
	mentioned earlier, education is a service.  Front line service
	providers (teachers) need both expertise and autonomy to respond to
	learner needs.</b> <b>The
	OECD tells us that PISA results are better for students in schools
	with autonomy for their day-to-day operation; the World Bank advises
	Ministries of Education to delegate. PEI should also delegate.</b></p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0in"><b>Accountabilities
	not clear -</b><b>
	Mathew Bedard of the Montreal Economic Institute points out that
	“autonomy and accountability jointly applied” would cost
	practically nothing and allow education to better adapt to the
	diversity of student needs and aptitudes. Yet teachers and
	principals in PEI appear to have little freedom to adjust services
	to suit individual learner needs.</b></p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0in"><b>Collaboration
	</b><b>– the
	literature tells us that education thrives on collaboration yet.
	Paul Bennet speaks of the muffled voices of teachers. They work
	alone in classrooms, in fact the profession itself, operates as a
	silo.</b></p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0in"><b>Curriculum
	outcomes unrelated to life roles.</b></p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0in"><b>Department
	role understated –</b><b>
	“develop and deliver curriculum” fails to capture the
	significance of what educators do</b></p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0in"><b>Assessment
	and grading at odds with life practises</b></p></li>

issues are not new; no doubt readers have others to propose. All
should be considered. They need to be dealt with soon, and should be
dealt with in a public manner. </b>
