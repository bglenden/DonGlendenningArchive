  D Accountability   
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Don analyzes role descriptions from the Department of Education website, finding that while the Minister&#x27;s responsibilities are clearly defined with measurable actions, the Deputy Minister and Superintendent roles are vague and lacking specific accomplishments. He concludes the organization has misaligned form and function, with decisions parachuted up to ministerial level rather than resolved at operational levels. This accountability deficit, he argues, is comforting for those seeking bureaucratic cover but frustrating for dedicated professionals. The analysis demonstrates his systems-thinking approach: examining actual organizational documentation to identify dysfunction. His critique reveals how government control creates lack of accountability at operational levels.</div>

<p>Dear Sir:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><b>Accountability in education</b></p>
<p>The issue of accountability often arises when speaking of education, so I decided to see what the Department of Education website says about what key decision-makers do; here is what I found:</p>
<p>The Minister defines, provides, assesses, establishes, approves and even prohibits – all actions are do-able, clear, concise, and measurable.</p>
<p>The Deputy Minister is responsible for many things but, at least according to the website, doesn’t really do much.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The ELSB Superintendent doesn’t seem to do much either although she does play a role in formulating and executing a Strategic Plan, promotes a culture of excellence and is responsible for a number of things</p>
<p>School principals “exercise leadership supervisory and administrative responsibilities”</p>
<p>Since teachers must hold an instructional license we can assume that they instruct</p>
<p>The above findings, unscientific as they are, point to an organization where form and function are likely out of sync, issues are parachuted up to the Minister for decisions and there’s not a lot of focus on accomplishment.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Comforting for people wanting cover but frustrating for dedicated professionals. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p><br></p>

<p>Now I’ve known Deputy Ministers in PEI for many years and know that they are busy people but I find the difference in role descriptions to be very interesting.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
