  2 2014 This one for Education
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Commemorating Confederation&#x27;s 150th anniversary in 2014, Don proposes using this milestone to establish an educational legacy rather than merely celebrating the past. He views education as central to Canada&#x27;s future and suggests creating an innovation fund, think tank, national center for public engagement, demonstration projects, or citizenship focus. The letter reflects Don&#x27;s belief that education transcends institutional change to address fundamental national development. His vision positions education as the determinant of Canada&#x27;s collective future.</div>

<p>Dear Editor:</p>
<p><b>2014: This one for education</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>In 1864 our political leaders met in Charlottetown to commence discussions on a scenario for political union; discussions went well and were continued, a few weeks later in Quebec City. The result was the forming of Canada. Should the event be celebrated? Absolutely!!! Ours is a remarkable country, and it is still evolving; we should celebrate that fact at every opportunity.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Should we have a party? I think we should; it doesn't have to be a fancy one, some entertainment, some music, a bit of food, some storytelling and reminiscing - and don't forget to invite some friends</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Should we give ourselves a gift, a legacy to mark the event? Probably not necessary, but it would be nice; something about our future rather than our past. When I think of Canada's future, I think of education; I'm of the view that education will, to a large extent, be the determinant of our future – both individually and as a country. No, I'm not thinking of a new course or program, or even a new institution. Perhaps an innovation fund, a think tank, a national centre for public engagement; a few demonstration projects?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Or perhaps a focus on citizenship? Something to position us for the future?</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>l'm sure that the PEl20L4 would welcome your views. And, if you want to share your ideas with me, you may do so at standards2020@smail.com.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
<p><br></p>
