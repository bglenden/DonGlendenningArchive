  Reading Clinic
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Don submits a letter to Charlottetown Guardian editor (December 12, 2011) proposing public reading clinics modeled on specialized medical clinics like Calgary&#x27;s knee clinic. Inspired by an article on reducing wait times and unnecessary tests, Don applies the clinic concept to reading instruction. He identifies reading as a key skill and primary parental concern, proposing mainstream clinics (not research-focused) staffed by reading specialists who would assess problems, identify needs, and create learning plans addressing fluency, grammar, comprehension, spelling, and vocabulary. Don envisions fee-for-service operation open to Islanders through direct access or referral, distinguishing this from university research clinics. He identifies himself as &quot;a long-time student of education&quot; and invites reader commentary at an email address.</div>

<p>December 12, 2011</p>
<p>Editor, Charlottetown Guardian</p>
<p>Charlottetown, PEI	</p>
<p>Dear Sir:</p>
<p>A Public Reading Clinic</p>
<p>A Globe and Mail article on October 07 carried a story about the Calgary knee clinic; early results show that both wait times and unnecessary tests have been reduced.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>While reading the article, I began to wonder if there was a place in our education system for specialized clinics.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Reading comes quickly to mind, it being such a key skill, but there are certainly other possibilities as well.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In most of my encounters with parents whose children are still in the school system, reading seems to be the number one concern but a clinic could also serve adults. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>My thinking is for a clinic in the mainstream, not for research, actually putting into practice that which we already know about fluency, grammar, comprehension, spelling, vocabulary and other factors that limit one’s ability to read. Staffed by one or more specialists and support staff, clinics would assess reading problems, identify needs and create learning plans. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>While reading is not my specialty, why couldn’t a reading clinic, operating much like a dental or eye clinic, be open to any Islander either directly or by referral <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>and operate on a fee for service basis? <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Some universities now have reading clinics but their primary interest seems to be research. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Readers are invited to comment at standards2020@gmail.com<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
<p>Don Glendenning</p>
<p>A long-time student of education</p>
