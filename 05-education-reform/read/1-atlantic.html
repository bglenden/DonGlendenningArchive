<div class="reader-summary">Don&#x27;s first published letter to the Guardian (October 8, 1996) responding to an Atlantic Canada education study, commending its timeliness while questioning its scope. He advocates for schools to address three dimensions: citizenship, work preparation, and further education, noting the study emphasized only academic achievement. Critiques the apparent abandonment of schools&#x27; responsibility in work preparation and calls for reassessment of this role. Questions whether data on technology course participation exists and challenges statistics about student destinations beyond graduation, arguing that tracking the 70% not attending university would improve program planning. Demonstrates his early emphasis on comprehensive education addressing multiple student pathways rather than university-only focus.</div>

<p>Dear Editor:</p>
<p>Education in Atlantic Canada</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I read with interest your article on the results of a recent study of education in Atlantic Canada. It appears that PEI fared quite well. Assessment of this kind is long overdue. Not surprisingly, the study emphasized academic achievement. The public, I believe, expects more of its schools. Simply stated, schools should prepare students for citizenship, work and further education. The report dealt mostly with the latter.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The school system appears to have rejected any role in preparing young people for work; the public, I think, still expects it. lt is time to re-examine the issue. Assuming schools have such a role should also assess the extent to which this role is being fulfilled.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The report provides insight into course enrolments in mathematics, science, language arts and fine arts. Given the need for a technologically literate citizenry and workforce, it would be useful, I feel, to know the extent to which students participate in technology courses.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>One must be careful in quoting statistics, however, the report states that for every 100 students who enter school- about B0 complete Grade t2. Of those who graduate, about 30 proceed directly to university. lt appears that we do not know what happens to the other 10. Some likely go to a community college, a private school or directly to work. Knowing the destination of the other 70 percent should greatly improve our ability to plan appropriate school programs. Enrolment in community college programs, in particular, should not be difficult to document since these institutions have been around for over 3 decades.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I commend the Atlantic Ministers for their initiative and look forward to information about how well our schools serve all our just those who are university bound.</p>
<p><br></p>
