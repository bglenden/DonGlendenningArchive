<div class="reader-summary">Don challenges the assumption that school closures due to weather are necessary, arguing instead that schools should remain open with participation being a choice. He distinguishes between schooling and education, noting that groups don&#x27;t learn—individuals do. The piece proposes that schools remain available as resources, teachers decide individually whether to attend, students/parents choose daily attendance, and bus operators determine route safety. Don criticizes the administrative convenience of closures as pedagogically disruptive and advocates for distributed decision-making rather than blanket institutional closures.</div>

<p><br></p>
<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p><b>School Closings</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>
<p>In recent days, I have been part of several discussions about school closings. The most interesting</p>
<p>was a brief conversation with a stranger while waiting in line at a store. It turns out that he was a</p>
<p>teacher who found his way to a store at 8.00 am but was upset because school opening was only</p>
<p>delayed instead of school being cancelled. He was not looking forward to the day; the students</p>
<p>would not be in a good mood; they also wanted/expected schools to be cancelled.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>School cancellation is based on a number of assumptions. One is that schooling and education are</p>
<p>the same; they're not. Schooling is an important part of education but it is only a part. A second</p>
<p>assumption is that groups learn; they don't. Only individuals learn although they may learn in a</p>
<p>group setting. In fact, some things can best be learned with others; but certainly not all. Finally,</p>
<p>we have assigned schools the responsibility of, not only what takes in place in school, but also</p>
<p>with transporting learners from their homes to a school of our choice.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I would like to comment on three elements of the school- closing issue. First is the matter of the</p>
<p>school buildings and physical resources within them. A schedule of school and resource</p>
<p>availability should be established and maintained. Yes, there will be instances when a building</p>
<p>may be closed because of emergency situations but only in genuine emergencies. A snowfall</p>
<p>andlor high winds is not sufficient reason, to my way of thinking, to close a school building unless</p>
<p>it is felt that the structure is likely to collapse causing danger to the people inside.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>A separate decision needs to be made about which resources within a school should be open to</p>
<p>students when numbers are small or teachers are absent. Most study areas including</p>
<p>library/resource centres, classrooms, and computer labs could be opened to most students most of</p>
<p>the time; some study areas may have to be restricted.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>With schools generally open, teachers will have to decide whether conditions allow them to reach</p>
<p>their place of work. It is an individual decision. Teachers living nearby, should have no problem;</p>
<p>those living at a distance from the school may miss some days. When teachers cannot keep to a</p>
<p>schedule, they should let their clients, the students, know. When a teacher accepts a teaching</p>
<p>post, there is a contract to provide a service and that contract should be honoured at all</p>
<p>reasonable cost. A staffing policy may be required to deal with teacher absences but closing a</p>
<p>school so that a teacher gets paid should not be an option.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The Government provides opportunity, encouragement, teachers and other resources to assist</p>
<p>students to obtain a quality education but only learners can learn. It is a responsibility of learners,</p>
<p>or their parents, to ensure that learners take advantage ofthe resources. Teachers certainly play a</p>
<p>role in motivating students" Students make individual decisions about if what, when, how and</p>
<p>how much they learn; even when we are teaching, learners may be learning something quite</p>
<p>different from what is intended"</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>As for transportation, there are at last two separate points of decision-making. People providing</p>
<p>the bus service, or the operators themselves, should decide whether or not it is safe to drive. If</p>
<p>conditions are unsafe, buses should stay offthe road and students along the route should be</p>
<p>informed of the change of plans. Even when buses are operating, parents are the ones to decide</p>
<p>each day whether or not their child gets on the bus. If bus transportation is not available, a parent</p>
<p>may arrange alternative transportation if they know the school is open.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Frequently I am asked if the above policies will not result in some students being ahead or behind</p>
<p>others and if the gap will widen. This implies that students in the same grade are at the same</p>
<p>level of achievement and move forward in a lock-step fashion. This is far from the case. In any</p>
<p>class, some students are ahead and others behind the average - whatever average means. The</p>
<p>system copes with students who lose a day due to illness, why can't it also cope with a student</p>
<p>who loses a day due to bad weather? Granted the number of absentees may be larger on a storm</p>
<p>day, but the problem remains essentially the same.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Closing schools on stormy days is administratively convenient but I believe is disruptive to</p>
<p>students and learning. The decision to attend or not attend on any given day belongs to the</p>
<p>student and"/or pa"rents. I am quite satisfied that teachers are both willing and able to deal with</p>
<p>school absences in a less disruptive fashion. .</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
<p><br></p>
