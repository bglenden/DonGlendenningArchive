<p>ABOUT EDUCATION</p>
<p>Glendenning Notes</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>AUTONOMY AND ACCOUNTABILITY</b></p>
<p>A-3-A												Doc 5 One of the hallmarks of Holland College among community colleges in Canada was its degree of autonomy in its day-to-day operation; the writer is of the view that a similar level of autonomy and accountability should be extended to public schools.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The OECD, who gives us PISA , agrees.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>According to the OECD</p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li1">in countries where schools have greater autonomy over what is taught and how students are assessed, students tend to perform better.”</li>
  <li class="li1">in countries were schools account for their results by posting achievement data publicly, schools that enjoy greater autonomy in resource location tend to show better student performance than those with less autonomy.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li1">In countries where there are no such accountability arrangements, schools with greater autonomy in resource allocation tend to perform worse.<span class="Apple-converted-space">                         </span></li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p>Organizational accountability is about defining an organization’s mission, values and goals as well as everyone’s role in working towards them; holding yourself, and everyone else,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>responsible for accomplishing goals, completing assignments and making decisions that deliver on expectations;<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>people resist and fail to support what they don’t understand; culture of accountability. Start with clarity and set expectations; be goal focused, hire the right people, Communicate with transparency. team and individual productivity, builds trust and collaboration, helps organization perform .<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>PEI – the writer did not have a copy of roles and responsibilities of teacher and principals at time of writing,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p>COMMENT</p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li1">The philosophy of education published by the Department refers to helping students find “a place”.: not sure what we mean by “place”.</li>
  <li class="li1">“Developing and delivering” is a narrow role for a Department</li>
  <li class="li1">A number of education functions have been left out of documents</li>
  <li class="li1">Widespread view that education and “going to school” are one and the same</li>
  <li class="li1">Did not find role descriptions for teachers and principals<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li1">Absence of reports on performance reached</li>
