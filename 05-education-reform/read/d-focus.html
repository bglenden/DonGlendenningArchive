  D Focus  -
</div>

<div class="reader-summary">Don&#x27;s foundational letter examining the structural misalignment between public education&#x27;s stated mission and actual implementation in PEI. He argues that education is deeply complex, serving diverse learners with different needs, and that clear communication and shared definitions are essential. After reviewing PEI Department documents, school websites, and various educational bodies, Don finds no consistent definition of &quot;education&quot; and notes that the Department&#x27;s official role—to &quot;develop and deliver high quality programs and curriculum&quot;—is too narrow. He references World Bank warnings against confusing &quot;going to school&quot; with &quot;getting an education,&quot; observes that PEI&#x27;s Department structure focuses on running schools rather than providing education services, and concludes the current system is misaligned with community needs and expectations. He recommends the three readings: World Bank&#x27;s Crisis in Education (2019), Bedard&#x27;s Pedagogical Autonomy (2015), and OECD Education 2030.</div>

</div><p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 108%">Dear
Editor:</p>
<p align="center" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 108%"><b>A
Change of Focus</b></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 108%">											</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 108%">Some
time ago, I set out to explore public education with a view to better
understanding concerns of the local community. Education is complex;
it is deeply embedded in our culture Learners have different
interests, experiences, capabilities and needs; they also fill a
variety of life roles. Those who teach, or other-wise serve learners,
must be very clear in their communication; information plays a key
role.  
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 108%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 108%">First,
I looked for a PEI definition; I did this because I’m not sure that
we think of education in the same way.  I checked school websites,
Department documents, and miscelaneous agendas including MPHEC. PSB,
CAMET, CMEC, MPHEC, CEA and others.  A Maritime definition is hard to
find. The Education Act describes education as “the process of
imparting or acquiring knowledge.”  I like it but find ”knowledge”
a bit narrow a vision for 2023. In addition to knowledge, however, 
we need to include “skills, attitudes and other attributes”
needed for the years ahead.  A clear and shared definition is
important.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 108%"> 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 108%">While
trying to sort out the next step, I encountered a report by the World
Bank cautioning Ministries of Education not to confuse “going to
school with getting an  education.”. On review, it appears that we
also do this. For example, the structure of the Department seems
focused on running schools rather than providing education services.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 108%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 108%">Then
I searched for “purpose”; again unclear” 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 108%">Finally,
I looked at the structure of Government Departments.  Most are
structured around branches or fields,  but not education; it  is
focused on running schools. In fact the official role adopted by the
PEI Department is even narrower; ” to develop and deliver high
quality programs and curriculum.” – a much narrower role than I
find our community needs and expects.  
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 108%">Then
I decided to write this letter</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 108%"><br />

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 108%">Readers
interested in public education may find the following of interest:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0in"> World
	Bank, <u>Crisis in
	Education</u>, 2019</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0in">Bedard,
	Mathieu, <u>Pedagogical
	Auton</u>omy, 
	Montreal Economic Institute, 2015</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0in">OECD
	<u>Education, 2030</u></p></li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 108%">My
conclusion is that the structure of public education in PEI is at
odds with its purpose; a review is called for.  The task is important
but not onerous.  Definition and purpose are key to future success.
